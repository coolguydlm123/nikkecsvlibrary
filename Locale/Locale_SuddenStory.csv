d_ex_armory_01_title,Armory Ghost Story
d_ex_armory_01_1,Commander...
d_ex_armory_01_2,"Have you ever heard of the Talking Gun?
It's one of the 7 mysteries of the Outpost."
d_ex_armory_01_3,Never heard of it.
d_ex_armory_01_4,Really? Then allow me to explain.
d_ex_armory_01_5,"A long time ago, back before Nikkes existed,"
d_ex_armory_01_6,"when humans were powerless against the Raptures,"
d_ex_armory_01_7,Elysion's weapon institute crafted a whole bunch of experimental weapons.
d_ex_armory_01_8,"The Talking Gun was rumored to be one of them, and one of the materials used to create it was..."
d_ex_armory_01_9,... living human beings!
d_ex_armory_01_10,Eeek!
d_ex_armory_01_11,That's why it can talk like a human. Hehehe.
d_ex_armory_01_12,Emma... you know I can't stand creepy stories like that.
d_ex_armory_01_13,"You're not scared, are you?"
d_ex_armory_01_14,"After all, Nikkes are basically a weapons system with a human brain as a component."
d_ex_armory_01_15,"Yeah, but..."
d_ex_armory_01_16,at least we're living things. A gun is... just an object.
d_ex_armory_01_17,"Hmm. Oh well.
Commander, what do you think?"
d_ex_armory_01_18,Nikkes are living beings.
d_ex_armory_01_19,I'm not sure.
d_ex_armory_01_20,...
d_ex_armory_01_21,I'm glad you feel that way.
d_ex_armory_01_22,"What do you think, Emma?"
d_ex_armory_01_23,Me?
d_ex_armory_01_24,Well...
d_ex_armory_01_25,"I agree with the Commander, of course!"
d_ex_armory_01_26,You're just kissing up to him.
d_ex_armory_01_27,Am not!
d_ex_armory_01_28,"Hmm, most unexpected."
d_ex_armory_01_29,I assumed your answer would be filled with confidence.
d_ex_armory_01_30,I believe this is something that cannot be easily defined.
d_ex_armory_01_31,"Right...
Nowadays, nearly everyone relies on machines to live in some capacity."
d_ex_armory_01_32,"Humans have machines inside them, and vice versa with Nikkes."
d_ex_armory_01_33,"How little separation must there be before the definition of ""life"" must be changed?"
d_ex_armory_01_34,I'm still not sure.
d_ex_armory_01_35,"Uhh, Emma."
d_ex_armory_01_36,Why bother thinking about this kinda stuff anyway?
d_ex_armory_01_37,"""Living"" or not,"
d_ex_armory_01_38,"all we gotta do is kill whatever gets in our way, and let the rest pass on by."
d_ex_armory_01_39,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_01_40,I suppose that's a good argument.
d_ex_armory_01_41,Simple. Easy to adhere to.
d_ex_armory_01_42,"My goodness, how did this story get so serious?"
d_ex_armory_01_43,"Anyhoo, back to the Talking Gun."
d_ex_armory_01_44,"At first, it was considered a magnificent weapon, on par with a Nikke."
d_ex_armory_01_45,"However, since it did not resemble a human in any shape or form, it was easier for soldiers to use and abuse it."
d_ex_armory_01_46,"Many errors occurred as a result, as well as what we nowadays call Mind Switch."
d_ex_armory_01_47,"The gun was deemed to be defective, and every single one was tossed into the darkest corners of this massive armory."
d_ex_armory_01_48,"Now, every night when the janitor comes,"
d_ex_armory_01_49,"they will hear the sounds of the Talking Gun whispering,"
d_ex_armory_01_50,"""Don't leave me here."""
d_ex_armory_01_51,Aah!
d_ex_armory_01_52,D-don't scare me like that!
d_ex_armory_01_53,...
d_ex_armory_01_54,...
d_ex_armory_01_55,... Did you hear anything?
d_ex_armory_01_56,I did.
d_ex_armory_01_57,... Hmm. Not much of a reaction.
d_ex_armory_01_58,"Vesti, do you wanna bet?"
d_ex_armory_01_59,On what?
d_ex_armory_01_60,Who can reach the armory entrance first.
d_ex_armory_01_61,"I'll count down from 3, okay?"
d_ex_armory_01_62,"Hey, wait!"
d_ex_armory_01_63,Three.
d_ex_armory_01_64,Two.
d_ex_armory_01_65,Don'tgodon'tgodon'tgopleasewaitpleasewaitpleasepleaseplease...
d_ex_armory_01_66,One!
d_ex_armory_01_67,WAAAAH!!
d_ex_armory_01_68,All three of us hightail it out of there.
d_ex_armory_02_title,Tickets to the Gun Show
d_ex_armory_02_1,*Creak*
d_ex_armory_02_2,"Wow, so this is the armory."
d_ex_armory_02_3,Anybody here?
d_ex_armory_02_4,...
d_ex_armory_02_5,"With Absolute looking after this place, you know it's in good hands."
d_ex_armory_02_6,I can't wait to see what they've got lying around!
d_ex_armory_02_7,"Well, look who the cat dragged in."
d_ex_armory_02_8,What are you doing here?
d_ex_armory_02_9,I came to check out the weapons.
d_ex_armory_02_10,The bigger the better!
d_ex_armory_02_11,We're not a free gun show for third-rate squads.
d_ex_armory_02_12,You don't say...
d_ex_armory_02_13,How about if I'm part of a fourth-rate squad?
d_ex_armory_02_14,Please keep your voice down!
d_ex_armory_02_15,So only the best of the best get to see the finest weapons?
d_ex_armory_02_16,How the heck do I become the best of the best?
d_ex_armory_02_17,I swear...
d_ex_armory_02_18,"Take a hike, both of you."
d_ex_armory_02_19,"So if we become a first-rate squad, then we can see the weapons?"
d_ex_armory_02_20,Are there any weapons that third-rate squads get to see?
d_ex_armory_02_21,"Mental cases, both of you..."
d_ex_armory_02_22,"First of all, that will never happen."
d_ex_armory_02_23,"Even if by some miracle you did, I still wouldn't show a single pistol to four-eyes over there."
d_ex_armory_02_24,Very funny.
d_ex_armory_02_25,"Like I said, there's nothing here for inferior squads."
d_ex_armory_02_26,"So beat it, and take poindexter with you."
d_ex_armory_02_27,"C'mon, don't be like that. Just one weapon, pretty please?"
d_ex_armory_02_28,... Tsk.
d_ex_armory_02_29,"Fine. If it'll get you out of my hair, just one."
d_ex_armory_02_30,Woo-hoo! Thanks a bunch!
d_ex_armory_02_31,*Thud*
d_ex_armory_02_32,Eunhwa tosses a small gun on top of the counter.
d_ex_armory_02_33,Hey!
d_ex_armory_02_34,What's the big idea of showing us this pea shooter?
d_ex_armory_02_35,You could at least show us something with some oomph to it...
d_ex_armory_02_36,"You've barely even looked at it.
How can you be so sure it's that weak?"
d_ex_armory_02_37,I'm not picking up any energy from it.
d_ex_armory_02_38,Energy?
d_ex_armory_02_39,"Yeah, it's this sensation I get when I'm near firepower."
d_ex_armory_02_40,"When I'm close to a powerful weapon,
the energy can be so overwhelming that the light hurts my eyes!"
d_ex_armory_02_41,... This has all been a giant waste of my time.
d_ex_armory_02_42,"You asked if I could show you one, and there it is. Now get lost."
d_ex_armory_02_43,Fine...
d_ex_armory_02_44,"By the way, most of the weapons on display here may look impressive,"
d_ex_armory_02_45,but they're seriously lacking in the firepower department.
d_ex_armory_02_46,You've got some nerve. You barely gave one pistol a glance!
d_ex_armory_02_47,My senses are accurate.
d_ex_armory_02_48,I'm not picking up much energy.
d_ex_armory_02_49,...
d_ex_armory_02_50,"Fine then, if you had to pick one of these weapons, which would you choose?"
d_ex_armory_02_51,Eunhwa puts down two same sized weapons on the counter.
d_ex_armory_02_52,"Oh, this is a fun game!"
d_ex_armory_02_53,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_02_54,The one on the right.
d_ex_armory_02_55,...
d_ex_armory_02_56,I'm picking up more energy from that one.
d_ex_armory_02_57,...
d_ex_armory_02_58,Stay right there.
d_ex_armory_02_59,Eunhwa starts bringing out various weapons to put Neon to the test.
d_ex_armory_02_60,Neon is able to pick out the more powerful weapon every single time.
d_ex_armory_02_61,...
d_ex_armory_02_62,I'm at a loss for words...
d_ex_armory_02_63,"It pains me to say this, but...
you clearly have a nose for firepower."
d_ex_armory_02_64,You really think so?
d_ex_armory_02_65,You said you came to see a weapon?
d_ex_armory_02_66,Was there anything specific you were looking for?
d_ex_armory_02_67,"Nah, I just wanted to do some browsing."
d_ex_armory_02_68,"I wish I could have seen more,
but thanks for showing me what you have."
d_ex_armory_02_69,...
d_ex_armory_02_70,I've got some special weapons inside... would you be interested in those?
d_ex_armory_02_71,Special weapons?!
d_ex_armory_02_72,Of course the REAL weapons are stored somewhere else!
d_ex_armory_02_73,I should have known an armory managed by Absolute wouldn't be this plain.
d_ex_armory_02_74,Oh man... I can sense the firepower from here... my hands are shaking...
d_ex_armory_02_75,Please show me!
d_ex_armory_02_76,But what about my Master?
d_ex_armory_02_77,Showing your master such exceptional weaponry would be casting pearls before swine.
d_ex_armory_02_78,This way.
d_ex_armory_02_79,...
d_ex_armory_02_80,Soon after.
d_ex_armory_02_81,Eunhwa and Neon come back out from around the counter.
d_ex_armory_02_82,How was it inside?
d_ex_armory_02_83,It... It was like I'd died and gone to heaven.
d_ex_armory_02_84,The walls were lined with absolutely gigantic weapons I'd never seen before!
d_ex_armory_02_85,"There were such vast amounts of energy in there, my head was spinning."
d_ex_armory_02_86,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
d_ex_armory_02_87,Eunhwa was even kind enough to explain a lot of them to me.
d_ex_armory_02_88,... I mean kinder than before.
d_ex_armory_02_89,Thank you for everything. I really enjoyed this.
d_ex_armory_02_90,...
d_ex_armory_02_91,I'll let you know if anything interesting comes in.
d_ex_armory_02_92,Eunhwa returns back to the counter without looking back.
d_ex_armory_02_93,That was a blast!
d_ex_armory_02_94,Neon and I leave the armory in high spirits.
d_ex_armory_03_title,A True Craftsman Never Blames Their Tools
d_ex_armory_03_1,What is this place?
d_ex_armory_03_2,It's the Armory.
d_ex_armory_03_3,Will we be able to find spare parts here?
d_ex_armory_03_4,Most of the weapons here are brand new. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find what I'm looking for.
d_ex_armory_03_5,"Well, look who the cat dragged in."
d_ex_armory_03_6,...
d_ex_armory_03_7,What are a Pilgrim and a weakling like you doing here?
d_ex_armory_03_8,We need parts.
d_ex_armory_03_9,"Stick 'em up, this is a robbery."
d_ex_armory_03_10,"This is an armory, not a shopping mall. Now get lost."
d_ex_armory_03_11,Sorry for disturbing you.
d_ex_armory_03_12,Snow White turns back and prepares to leave.
d_ex_armory_03_13,... Wait a second.
d_ex_armory_03_14,??
d_ex_armory_03_15,"Perfect. When I smash your face in, I can say it was self-defense."
d_ex_armory_03_16,I'm here for some parts.
d_ex_armory_03_17,Parts?
d_ex_armory_03_18,What exactly are you looking for?
d_ex_armory_03_19,A trigger.
d_ex_armory_03_20,What model?
d_ex_armory_03_21,"No model number, it's a unique make. Telling you wouldn't make any difference."
d_ex_armory_03_22,Then show me the gun.
d_ex_armory_03_23,...
d_ex_armory_03_24,"Without saying a word, Snow White hands over her gun to Eunhwa."
d_ex_armory_03_25,Eunhwa stares at the gun for a while.
d_ex_armory_03_26,...
d_ex_armory_03_27,You call this sorry thing a gun?
d_ex_armory_03_28,What's the problem?
d_ex_armory_03_29,"The rifling is almost completely worn down, and the sight bead is crooked. And what on earth happened to the magazine?"
d_ex_armory_03_30,"Well, it works for me. Haven't missed my mark yet."
d_ex_armory_03_31,Sigh...
d_ex_armory_03_32,Wait here.
d_ex_armory_03_33,"A moment later, Eunhwa comes back with another rifle."
d_ex_armory_03_34,Take this.
d_ex_armory_03_35,"This is the cream of the crop from Elysion. You don't exactly look like someone with a stable income, so consider it a gift."
d_ex_armory_03_36,It's leagues better than that rickety old pea shooter you've got.
d_ex_armory_03_37,"This is from the ELY-AR-14 series, right?"
d_ex_armory_03_38,"... Good eye. Yeah, that's right."
d_ex_armory_03_39,It is called the ELY-AR-17C.
d_ex_armory_03_40,Have they fixed the issue with sweat pooling up around the grip?
d_ex_armory_03_41,"They did a complete overhaul on the texture of the grip, so that's no longer an issue."
d_ex_armory_03_42,What about the trajectory having a downward slant after 1 km?
d_ex_armory_03_43,"Solved, thanks to the improved rifling and flash suppressor."
d_ex_armory_03_44,"Very good. With those flaws taken care of, it might just be the perfect firearm."
d_ex_armory_03_45,"It's the best AR on the market, bar none. Go on, take it."
d_ex_armory_03_46,"It's an incredibly kind offer, but no thanks."
d_ex_armory_03_47,What?
d_ex_armory_03_48,"I'm satisfied with the weapon I'm currently using. So if you could just find me a trigger, that'd be great."
d_ex_armory_03_49,...
d_ex_armory_03_50,Anything you're looking for in particular?
d_ex_armory_03_51,I'm not picky. Just as long as it's not a double trigger.
d_ex_armory_03_52,Wait a second.
d_ex_armory_03_53,A while later.
d_ex_armory_03_54,Try this one.
d_ex_armory_03_55,The trigger Eunhwa flings over seems a little worn.
d_ex_armory_03_56,... Is this second-hand?
d_ex_armory_03_57,You guessed it.
d_ex_armory_03_58,Can't you get her a new one?
d_ex_armory_03_59,"Actually, when it comes to triggers, you want one that's slightly used."
d_ex_armory_03_60,Brand new triggers can have too much resistance when you pull them.
d_ex_armory_03_61,"You hear that? If you don't know what you're talking about, then keep your mouth shut."
d_ex_armory_03_62,...
d_ex_armory_03_63,"Many thanks. This will be most useful, I'm sure."
d_ex_armory_03_64,Farewell.
d_ex_armory_03_65,See you.
d_ex_armory_03_66,Snow White leaves the armory in a hurry.
d_ex_armory_03_67,...
d_ex_armory_03_68,Feeling bad about helping out a Pilgrim?
d_ex_armory_03_69,Probably pains you to give away something for free.
d_ex_armory_03_70,It's not that.
d_ex_armory_03_71,Would you shut it?
d_ex_armory_03_72,...
d_ex_armory_03_73,"That weapon she's been using is in such a sorry state,"
d_ex_armory_03_74,but she's managed to accomplish so much with it.
d_ex_armory_03_75,...
d_ex_armory_03_76,Whatever.
d_ex_armory_03_77,"Eunhwa barges out of the armory,"
d_ex_armory_03_78,her eyes are blazing.
d_ex_cafe_01_title,Cash in Hand
d_ex_cafe_01_1,"At the Outpost, I go to check out the newly-opened Cafe Sweety."
d_ex_cafe_01_2,"Inside, there is nothing but a giant coffee vending machine."
d_ex_cafe_01_3,What the...
d_ex_cafe_01_4,"What's this, you ask? It's a coffee vending machine."
d_ex_cafe_01_5,What's it doing in a cafe?
d_ex_cafe_01_6,"Pssh, since when did you start being picky?"
d_ex_cafe_01_7,"That's not it, it's just..."
d_ex_cafe_01_8,We've got three drinks on the menu.
d_ex_cafe_01_9,"Sugar coffee, Milk coffee, and Cream Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_01_10,...
d_ex_cafe_01_11,"C'mon, just relax!"
d_ex_cafe_01_12,"You're our first customer, so have some Sugar Coffee on the house."
d_ex_cafe_01_13,Sugar takes some Sugar Coffee out of the machine and hands it to me.
d_ex_cafe_01_14,See what you think.
d_ex_cafe_01_15,Just a sip.
d_ex_cafe_01_16,Try.
d_ex_cafe_01_17,Frima nods intently.
d_ex_cafe_01_18,"Despite my apprehension, I take a sip."
d_ex_cafe_01_19,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_20,This is great!
d_ex_cafe_01_21,So it doesn't kill humans. Good to know.
d_ex_cafe_01_22,Then Nikkes must be able to drink it as well.
d_ex_cafe_01_23,Nice. Sell it.
d_ex_cafe_01_24,I told you it'd be fine!
d_ex_cafe_01_25,...
d_ex_cafe_01_26,Now we've got to divvy up the shares.
d_ex_cafe_01_27,"It was my idea, so I get the lion's share..."
d_ex_cafe_01_28,I should get 40%.
d_ex_cafe_01_29,I'm the one who got the vending machine.
d_ex_cafe_01_30,You must be pulling my leg.
d_ex_cafe_01_31,Who gave you the idea to sell coffee using a vending machine in the first place?
d_ex_cafe_01_32,Me!
d_ex_cafe_01_33,So I get 40% of the cut!
d_ex_cafe_01_34,Objection.
d_ex_cafe_01_35,Why?
d_ex_cafe_01_36,Me. Leader.
d_ex_cafe_01_37,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_38,...
d_ex_cafe_01_39,"Well well, aren't you something."
d_ex_cafe_01_40,You didn't lift a finger and you're proclaiming yourself a leader?
d_ex_cafe_01_41,You lazy oaf!
d_ex_cafe_01_42,*Click*
d_ex_cafe_01_43,There's no other way.
d_ex_cafe_01_44,Sugar draws her weapon.
d_ex_cafe_01_45,"What, you wanna make something out of it?!"
d_ex_cafe_01_46,Milk takes out her gun as well.
d_ex_cafe_01_47,...
d_ex_cafe_01_48,Frima does the same.
d_ex_cafe_01_49,Stop.
d_ex_cafe_01_50,What is it now?!
d_ex_cafe_01_51,"If the building collapses, you all will be responsible for the damages."
d_ex_cafe_01_52,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_53,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_54,!!!
d_ex_cafe_01_55,You sure you're okay with that?
d_ex_cafe_01_56,Everyone holsters their weapons.
d_ex_cafe_01_57,Then how do we choose?
d_ex_cafe_01_58,Rock paper scissors?
d_ex_cafe_01_59,No. Pure chance.
d_ex_cafe_01_60,"Well, what then?"
d_ex_cafe_01_61,You got any ideas?
d_ex_cafe_01_62,How about everyone earns however much they sell of their namesake drink?
d_ex_cafe_01_63,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_64,Earn what you sell... not bad.
d_ex_cafe_01_65,"You're pretty smart, Commander!"
d_ex_cafe_01_66,Acceptable.
d_ex_cafe_01_67,"All right, that's the rule from here on out."
d_ex_cafe_01_68,Agreed.
d_ex_cafe_01_69,I like it.
d_ex_cafe_01_70,In that case...
d_ex_cafe_01_71,Milk faces me and puts her hand out.
d_ex_cafe_01_72,??
d_ex_cafe_01_73,What are you staring at?
d_ex_cafe_01_74,"You're not trying to run off without paying, are you?"
d_ex_cafe_01_75,Wasn't it for free?
d_ex_cafe_01_76,I gave you a sample. I didn't say anything about it being free.
d_ex_cafe_01_77,...
d_ex_cafe_01_78,I pay Milk her money.
d_ex_cafe_01_79,Ka-ching! Hehe...
d_ex_cafe_01_80,Sugar puts her hand out towards Milk.
d_ex_cafe_01_81,What are you doing?
d_ex_cafe_01_82,I'm the one who had the Commander order a coffee.
d_ex_cafe_01_83,"Moreover, it was a Sugar Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_01_84,!!
d_ex_cafe_01_85,But I'm the one who asked them to pay. This is my money!
d_ex_cafe_01_86,Sugar Coffee. Rules are rules.
d_ex_cafe_01_87,"Damn, should've had him drink Milk Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_01_88,"Fine, I'll give you half."
d_ex_cafe_01_89,Frima extends her hand.
d_ex_cafe_01_90,What now?!
d_ex_cafe_01_91,Leader.
d_ex_cafe_01_92,...
d_ex_cafe_01_93,...
d_ex_cafe_01_94,Are you screwing with me?!
d_ex_cafe_01_95,Things are getting tense.
d_ex_cafe_01_96,I dip out before it gets worse.
d_ex_cafe_02_title,Cafe Sweety's New Menu
d_ex_cafe_02_1,I go inside the cafe to get a coffee after lunch.
d_ex_cafe_02_2,"All of Cafe Sweety's squad members are inside, looking very pensive."
d_ex_cafe_02_3,"Ah, perfect timing."
d_ex_cafe_02_4,What's the matter?
d_ex_cafe_02_5,The cafe's gotten 12 complaints already.
d_ex_cafe_02_6,People say it's ridiculous that we only have 3 drinks.
d_ex_cafe_02_7,"If they taste good, what's the problem?"
d_ex_cafe_02_8,If only we didn't have to deal with customers...
d_ex_cafe_02_9,So you're expanding the menu?
d_ex_cafe_02_10,That's what we were discussing.
d_ex_cafe_02_11,We've come up with a new idea. Take a look.
d_ex_cafe_02_12,Presenting item No. 4 on the Cafe Sweety menu!
d_ex_cafe_02_13,MilkSugarCream Coffee!
d_ex_cafe_02_14,...
d_ex_cafe_02_15,Wait a minute.
d_ex_cafe_02_16,Didn't we agree it was gonna be SugarCreamMilk Coffee?
d_ex_cafe_02_17,"The milk is at the top, so it should be MilkSugarCream."
d_ex_cafe_02_18,"Milk gets poured last, so it should be at the back."
d_ex_cafe_02_19,CreamSugarMilk coffee.
d_ex_cafe_02_20,I swear...
d_ex_cafe_02_21,Calm down.
d_ex_cafe_02_22,"Fine, we can figure out the name later."
d_ex_cafe_02_23,First we need to decide whether or not to even put it on the menu.
d_ex_cafe_02_24,Have a taste.
d_ex_cafe_02_25,"It's an even mix of sugar, cream and milk. It's bound to make your taste buds sing!"
d_ex_cafe_02_26,Sugar hands me some freshly prepared coffee.
d_ex_cafe_02_27,... The texture resembles something sludge-like.
d_ex_cafe_02_28,"C'mon, drink up!"
d_ex_cafe_02_29,I set my fears aside and take a sip.
d_ex_cafe_02_30,...!
d_ex_cafe_02_31,This is awful.
d_ex_cafe_02_32,It's great... if you want to poison someone.
d_ex_cafe_02_33,"Darn, maybe mixing everything together wasn't such a good idea after all."
d_ex_cafe_02_34,"That's fine, we kinda expected that's what would happen."
d_ex_cafe_02_35,Now is where you come in.
d_ex_cafe_02_36,Got any ideas for a new menu item?
d_ex_cafe_02_37,"Yeah, whatever you've got, fire away."
d_ex_cafe_02_38,Espresso.
d_ex_cafe_02_39,Mint Chocolate Latte.
d_ex_cafe_02_40,Espresso...
d_ex_cafe_02_41,"Just plain ol' coffee? No milk, cream, or sugar?"
d_ex_cafe_02_42,Right.
d_ex_cafe_02_43,"I'm fine with that, so long as you add some sugar."
d_ex_cafe_02_44,That's no different from Sugar Coffee.
d_ex_cafe_02_45,Espresso should be straight-up.
d_ex_cafe_02_46,Uh...
d_ex_cafe_02_47,People actually drink that stuff?
d_ex_cafe_02_48,I can't even imagine... that needs at least 10 spoonfuls of sugar.
d_ex_cafe_02_49,"But, different strokes for different folks...
I'll make the espresso."
d_ex_cafe_02_50,A little while later.
d_ex_cafe_02_51,"After some trial and error, 4 espressos have been made."
d_ex_cafe_02_52,Are you sure about the color? It's black.
d_ex_cafe_02_53,"According to the recipe, it's right..."
d_ex_cafe_02_54,And you drink it in this small cup?
d_ex_cafe_02_55,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_cafe_02_56,Looks good to me.
d_ex_cafe_02_57,"All right then, everyone down it on three."
d_ex_cafe_02_58,...
d_ex_cafe_02_59,...
d_ex_cafe_02_60,One-
d_ex_cafe_02_61,Two-
d_ex_cafe_02_62,Three!!
d_ex_cafe_02_63,Only Milk drinks hers.
d_ex_cafe_02_64,Ughhhhh! It's so bitter!
d_ex_cafe_02_65,What!? Nobody else drank it?
d_ex_cafe_02_66,"It needs more sugar, for sure."
d_ex_cafe_02_67,Hate bitter.
d_ex_cafe_02_68,...
d_ex_cafe_02_69,"I get you two flaking on me,"
d_ex_cafe_02_70,"but you, Commander? You're the one who suggested this!"
d_ex_cafe_02_71,Mint Chocolate Latte...
d_ex_cafe_02_72,You mean making a sweet coffee using mint?
d_ex_cafe_02_73,Yes.
d_ex_cafe_02_74,Sweet coffee? I'm on board.
d_ex_cafe_02_75,Have you ever tried mint?
d_ex_cafe_02_76,I heard it tastes like toothpaste.
d_ex_cafe_02_77,Uh...
d_ex_cafe_02_78,There are people who like their drinks to taste like toothpaste?
d_ex_cafe_02_79,I can't even imagine adding toothpaste to Sugar Coffee.
d_ex_cafe_02_80,"But, different strokes for different folks...
Mint Chocolate Latte it is."
d_ex_cafe_02_81,A bit later
d_ex_cafe_02_82,"After some trial and error, 4 Mint Chocolate Lattes have been made."
d_ex_cafe_02_83,Are you sure about the color? It's green.
d_ex_cafe_02_84,"According to the recipe, it's right..."
d_ex_cafe_02_85,The smell is super potent.
d_ex_cafe_02_86,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_cafe_02_87,Looks good to me.
d_ex_cafe_02_88,"All right then, everyone down it on three."
d_ex_cafe_02_89,...
d_ex_cafe_02_90,...
d_ex_cafe_02_91,One-
d_ex_cafe_02_92,Two-
d_ex_cafe_02_93,Three!!
d_ex_cafe_02_94,We all drink at the same time.
d_ex_cafe_02_95,Ugh? What is that?
d_ex_cafe_02_96,Terrible.
d_ex_cafe_02_97,I kinda like it.
d_ex_cafe_02_98,What?! You can't be serious.
d_ex_cafe_02_99,"I'm not picking up any toothpaste, and it's very sweet. It's not bad."
d_ex_cafe_02_100,I can't believe what I'm hearing...
d_ex_cafe_02_101,"What about you, Commander?"
d_ex_cafe_02_102,It's heavenly!
d_ex_cafe_02_103,I'd rather eat toothpaste.
d_ex_cafe_02_104,You two certainly have... unique tastes.
d_ex_cafe_02_105,"Yes, maybe Sugar's taste buds have gone crazy."
d_ex_cafe_02_106,...
d_ex_cafe_02_107,"Either way, I can't sell this."
d_ex_cafe_02_108,I don't want to sell something I wouldn't drink myself.
d_ex_cafe_02_109,I don't like such divisive drinks.
d_ex_cafe_02_110,Sorry.
d_ex_cafe_02_111,"Enough of this. I don't care if we end up getting complaints, the fourth new dish at Cafe Sweety will be..."
d_ex_cafe_02_112,nothing!
d_ex_cafe_02_113,They just said they were sorry. Maybe you can get another suggestion from them.
d_ex_cafe_02_114,"Sorry, you say?"
d_ex_cafe_02_115,Milk smiles and takes out her gun.
d_ex_cafe_02_116,I don't accept apologies.
d_ex_cafe_02_117,"I am, however, more than willing to accept cash. Or your life."
d_ex_cafe_02_118,...!
d_ex_cafe_02_119,I should have suggested something a bit less eccentric.
d_ex_cafe_02_120,I make a quiet escape while Milk kicks up a fuss.
d_ex_cafe_03_title,Milk's Patience
d_ex_cafe_03_1,"Is it me, or has business been dead around here?"
d_ex_cafe_03_2,It's quiet. Too quiet.
d_ex_cafe_03_3,Quiet. Happy.
d_ex_cafe_03_4,Do you think it's because the menu is so small?
d_ex_cafe_03_5,Or maybe we haven't tried hard enough to lure the customers in...
d_ex_cafe_03_6,"What do you think, Partner?"
d_ex_cafe_03_7,You'd be doing just fine if you didn't fight with the customers.
d_ex_cafe_03_8,What? Who says we fight with the customers?
d_ex_cafe_03_9,"Actually, I guess I have been a bit short with the customers lately..."
d_ex_cafe_03_10,"All right, from here on out, it's nothing but smiles all around from me!"
d_ex_cafe_03_11,*Clank*
d_ex_cafe_03_12,"Hey, is that a customer?!"
d_ex_cafe_03_13,Hello!
d_ex_cafe_03_14,Welcome!
d_ex_cafe_03_15,"Hey, Belorta."
d_ex_cafe_03_16,What'll you have?
d_ex_cafe_03_17,"We make everything here ourselves, take your pick!"
d_ex_cafe_03_18,Hmm...
d_ex_cafe_03_19,Do you have anything other than coffee?
d_ex_cafe_03_20,I'm not really a big java freak.
d_ex_cafe_03_21,... Excuse me?
d_ex_cafe_03_22,This is a cafe! What else would we possibly serve?
d_ex_cafe_03_23,"I don't know, desserts and stuff like that!"
d_ex_cafe_03_24,You're limiting yourself by only selling coffee...
d_ex_cafe_03_25,"Be honest, are you getting a lot of customers?"
d_ex_cafe_03_26,Wh-what?
d_ex_cafe_03_27,Sigh... I knew this would happen.
d_ex_cafe_03_28,"That's why I'm having someone come in to help you guys.
They run one of the most famous cafes in the Ark."
d_ex_cafe_03_29,Who the hell do you think you are?!
d_ex_cafe_03_30,"You're just a customer, so act like it! Shut up, drink your coffee, and get the hell out!"
d_ex_cafe_03_31,"You could at least hear what she has to say. I've already called her, after all."
d_ex_cafe_03_32,"Who knows, her advice could be a boon for business."
d_ex_cafe_03_33,"Speaking of which, I think that might be her."
d_ex_cafe_03_34,What?
d_ex_cafe_03_35,*Clank*
d_ex_cafe_03_36,Hello!
d_ex_cafe_03_37,"Hello, Emma!"
d_ex_cafe_03_38,Emma?
d_ex_cafe_03_39,You mean the person who runs that cafe is...
d_ex_cafe_03_40,"Yep, me!"
d_ex_cafe_03_41,"It's strange saying it out loud, but I suppose it is quite famous."
d_ex_cafe_03_42,"Belorta told me that
you're concerned that you don't have any desserts on the menu?"
d_ex_cafe_03_43,"Well, I decided to put my skills to good use."
d_ex_cafe_03_44,Emma takes out a box from the bag she brought.
d_ex_cafe_03_45,Inside the box lies a mysterious looking dessert.
d_ex_cafe_03_46,Wh-what is this?
d_ex_cafe_03_47,Just something I whipped up earlier.
d_ex_cafe_03_48,"It took a lot of doing, I'll tell you that much. Care to try some?"
d_ex_cafe_03_49,It's so nice of you to
d_ex_cafe_03_50,"do all of this for Cafe Sweety, really."
d_ex_cafe_03_51,Looks like my work is done here.
d_ex_cafe_03_52,"The customers will be rolling in soon enough, hehe!"
d_ex_cafe_03_53,"Thank you, Belorta."
d_ex_cafe_03_54,Hey! HEY!!
d_ex_cafe_03_55,Where are you going? Stop!
d_ex_cafe_03_56,No fighting with the customers.
d_ex_cafe_03_57,"Well... yeah, but... this is different!"
d_ex_cafe_03_58,"Whoops, I totally forgot."
d_ex_cafe_03_59,I was supposed to go for a drive today. Black Typhoon's waiting for me!
d_ex_cafe_03_60,If you'll excuse me...
d_ex_cafe_03_61,A motorcycle ride sounds nice!
d_ex_cafe_03_62,Be safe.
d_ex_cafe_03_63,You traitor!
d_ex_cafe_03_64,"She's not a customer, can we get rid of her later?"
d_ex_cafe_03_65,There's still a customer in front of you.
d_ex_cafe_03_66,Emma isn't a customer!
d_ex_cafe_03_67,*Cough*
d_ex_cafe_03_68,Zzzzzz...
d_ex_cafe_03_69,Seems like Frima is sleeping.
d_ex_cafe_03_70,"Commander, Milk, would you two like to try it?"
d_ex_cafe_03_71,Ahh...
d_ex_cafe_03_72,It wouldn't feel right refusing... she did put a lot of time into it...
d_ex_cafe_03_73,"Fine, let's get this over with!"
d_ex_cafe_03_74,"Actually, because it looks sooo delicious,"
d_ex_cafe_03_75,"I'm not sure about you, but I'm not willing to share."
d_ex_cafe_03_76,"Let's play rock, paper, scissors.
Winner can eat Emma's dessert."
d_ex_cafe_03_77,Are you sure?
d_ex_cafe_03_78,So long as I'm not the winner.
d_ex_cafe_03_79,I could make more you know...
d_ex_cafe_03_80,"Oh no, we wouldn't dream of it. You've already done so much."
d_ex_cafe_03_81,"C'mon, let's do this!"
d_ex_cafe_03_82,"Rock, paper, scissors..."
d_ex_cafe_03_83,Scissors!
d_ex_cafe_03_84,Rock!
d_ex_cafe_03_85,Paper!
d_ex_cafe_03_86,Gah!
d_ex_cafe_03_87,I...
d_ex_cafe_03_88,won?!
d_ex_cafe_03_89,H... he... hehehe.
d_ex_cafe_03_90,Time to face the music. Pal...
d_ex_cafe_03_91,"If you run into Sugar or Belorta,"
d_ex_cafe_03_92,tell them their time is limited.
d_ex_cafe_03_93,I leave the cafe without looking back at Milk.
d_ex_church_01_title,A Thief's End
d_ex_church_01_1,*Huff huff*
d_ex_church_01_2,The Big O shouldn't be able to find us here.
d_ex_church_01_3,"However, that doesn't mean we should rest easy."
d_ex_church_01_4,This church doesn't have any shields activated yet.
d_ex_church_01_5,??
d_ex_church_01_6,Care to explain?
d_ex_church_01_7,Must I explain everything to you?
d_ex_church_01_8,Did the Big O's mind attack give you short term memory loss or something?
d_ex_church_01_9,"Fine, I'll make this short."
d_ex_church_01_10,"A moment ago, I was with you in the Shopping Mall."
d_ex_church_01_11,"We were having a grand old time,"
d_ex_church_01_12,"and then we suddenly found the promised sword of victory, Excalibur."
d_ex_church_01_13,"No one else could make it budge,"
d_ex_church_01_14,"but you removed it from the stone, proving that you are a true warrior."
d_ex_church_01_15,"Because of that, you were chosen to be the owner of that sword."
d_ex_church_01_16,"But Dolla, that feeble-minded peddler..."
d_ex_church_01_17,she popped up out of nowhere and accused us of being thieves!
d_ex_church_01_18,But we are thieves.
d_ex_church_01_19,That coward...!
d_ex_church_01_20,...
d_ex_church_01_21,"Anyway, that's how we ended up in the A.C.P.U.'s crosshairs,"
d_ex_church_01_22,which led us to here.
d_ex_church_01_23,*Beep*
d_ex_church_01_24,"Mic test, one, two..."
d_ex_church_01_25,"Attention, sword thieves."
d_ex_church_01_26,Come out of the church at once.
d_ex_church_01_27,Or else we're coming in.
d_ex_church_01_28,Argh... They're right behind us.
d_ex_church_01_29,Let's just go out now and surrender.
d_ex_church_01_30,Looks like we'll need a heavy-duty shield.
d_ex_church_01_31,No.
d_ex_church_01_32,Surrender is not an option.
d_ex_church_01_33,We need a heavy-duty shield that these punks can't penetrate.
d_ex_church_01_34,Precisely.
d_ex_church_01_35,"And to make that shield,"
d_ex_church_01_36,we must go through the ancient holy ceremony.
d_ex_church_01_37,I'll tell you how it goes. Just follow my lead.
d_ex_church_01_38,All right.
d_ex_church_01_39,... A little while later.
d_ex_church_01_40,Everything is prepared.
d_ex_church_01_41,Let's do this.
d_ex_church_01_42,"Guillotine kneels before the holy figure,"
d_ex_church_01_43,and crosses her arms to make an ∞ sign.
d_ex_church_01_44,Infinity. Ohm. Limit.
d_ex_church_01_45,Infinity. Ohm. Limit.
d_ex_church_01_46,Don't repeat after me.
d_ex_church_01_47,What's gotten into you?
d_ex_church_01_48,You're backing out after coming this far?
d_ex_church_01_49,Do as she says.
d_ex_church_01_50,Sacred. Zool. Darkness.
d_ex_church_01_51,Sacred. Zool. Darkness.
d_ex_church_01_52,*Knock* *Knock knock*
d_ex_church_01_53,Do you hear me?
d_ex_church_01_54,We are prepared to use force if necessary.
d_ex_church_01_55,Let's just talk about this. No need for any of this to get nasty.
d_ex_church_01_56,Just ignore her.
d_ex_church_01_57,"After the shield is prepared, they won't be able to lay a finger on us."
d_ex_church_01_58,Got it.
d_ex_church_01_59,"I can't do this anymore, it's embarrassing."
d_ex_church_01_60,"All right, onto the next step."
d_ex_church_01_61,You can't trust your emotions right now.
d_ex_church_01_62,They're being manipulated by the force of the shield.
d_ex_church_01_63,Just put up with it a little longer.
d_ex_church_01_64,"All right, onto the next step."
d_ex_church_01_65,Guillotine holds her hand out in front of her
d_ex_church_01_66,"and extends her hips backwards, her body leaning slightly forward."
d_ex_church_01_67,Follow Guillotine perfectly.
d_ex_church_01_68,Follow Guillotine half-way.
d_ex_church_01_69,Integral. Volt.
d_ex_church_01_70,Judge-ment!!
d_ex_church_01_71,Integral. Volt. Judge-ment!!
d_ex_church_01_72,"*Bang*
*Swing*"
d_ex_church_01_73,A.C.P.U...!!
d_ex_church_01_74,...?
d_ex_church_01_75,...
d_ex_church_01_76,...
d_ex_church_01_77,Commander... what are you doing?
d_ex_church_01_78,Um... nothing.
d_ex_church_01_79,Uh...
d_ex_church_01_80,What was that sound just then?
d_ex_church_01_81,Judgment? Integral? What are those?
d_ex_church_01_82,...
d_ex_church_01_83,I don't mean to pry.
d_ex_church_01_84,It's just that I really don't know...
d_ex_church_01_85,"All right, enough grilling Miranda."
d_ex_church_01_86,...
d_ex_church_01_87,Guillotine takes a phone out of her pocket.
d_ex_church_01_88,Ingrid? It's me.
d_ex_church_01_89,I was caught doing the holy ceremony by the Big O.
d_ex_church_01_90,"Yes, this isn't my first rodeo, so I'll be fine."
d_ex_church_01_91,But I'm concerned about my partner.
d_ex_church_01_92,Could you send over a psychiatrist?
d_ex_church_01_93,What? None available?
d_ex_church_01_94,Ugh. Damn.
d_ex_church_01_95,She hangs up the phone.
d_ex_church_01_96,...
d_ex_church_01_97,I think I see what's going on here.
d_ex_church_01_98,Let's talk about this down at the station.
d_ex_church_01_99,*Clank clank*
d_ex_church_01_100,*Beep beep*
d_ex_church_02_title,By Reverent Command
d_ex_church_02_1,"I came here to clean up the church, as some have said it is too dirty."
d_ex_church_02_2,There's enough dust here to plug up both my nostrils.
d_ex_church_02_3,It seems like much of the dust is coming from the confessional.
d_ex_church_02_4,I head inside to clean it up.
d_ex_church_02_5,"As expected, the small room is caked in dust and grime."
d_ex_church_02_6,The moment I raise my broom...
d_ex_church_02_7,*Clank*
d_ex_church_02_8,"The end of the broom bumps into the door, closing it."
d_ex_church_02_9,All the dust made the room very stuffy. I go to open door to create some ventilation.
d_ex_church_02_10,...
d_ex_church_02_11,It's not opening!
d_ex_church_02_12,*Clatter clatter clatter*
d_ex_church_02_13,The door isn't budging.
d_ex_church_02_14,I need to do something...
d_ex_church_02_15,*Creak*
d_ex_church_02_16,I hear something from the adjacent room.
d_ex_church_02_17,"Honestly, the finale of all things..."
d_ex_church_02_18,I can't believe I missed it... stupid work making me come home late...
d_ex_church_02_19,"Judging by the voice, I think it's Signal."
d_ex_church_02_20,I couldn't wait until a re-run.
d_ex_church_02_21,"So, I ended up..."
d_ex_church_02_22,... I think she is confessing.
d_ex_church_02_23,I should pick the door and get out of here quick.
d_ex_church_02_24,I try to unlock the door using the card that I have.
d_ex_church_02_25,*Clank*
d_ex_church_02_26,!!
d_ex_church_02_27,A sound rings out as the card contacts the hammer.
d_ex_church_02_28,Whoa!
d_ex_church_02_29,Wh-who is it?
d_ex_church_02_30,...
d_ex_church_02_31,I-I heard something! Who is it?
d_ex_church_02_32,I-is it...
d_ex_church_02_33,a ghost?!
d_ex_church_02_34,"Yes, she can just run away like this...!"
d_ex_church_02_35,"C'mon, stay calm..."
d_ex_church_02_36,That's right! Neon said firepower can take down a ghost!
d_ex_church_02_37,I'll just shoot at it!
d_ex_church_02_38,Ahem!
d_ex_church_02_39,Huh?
d_ex_church_02_40,I... er... I am the protector of this place.
d_ex_church_02_41,I... It's talking?
d_ex_church_02_42,I am the Creator.
d_ex_church_02_43,The Creator?!
d_ex_church_02_44,"Yes, I sensed your sadness, so I came."
d_ex_church_02_45,Wow! Um... thanks!
d_ex_church_02_46,"Wait, haven't I heard this voice before?"
d_ex_church_02_47,The Commander... could it be?
d_ex_church_02_48,I should make my voice higher pitched.
d_ex_church_02_49,Who goes there?!
d_ex_church_02_50,Gah! Sorry! I must have been mistaken.
d_ex_church_02_51,Confess your sins to me.
d_ex_church_02_52,Well... there's this one TV show that I really like.
d_ex_church_02_53,Yesterday was the final episode.
d_ex_church_02_54,"Due to my mission, I wasn't able to watch the original airing. So I figured I would just watch a re-run next week."
d_ex_church_02_55,"But then I saw the reviews, and they all mentioned how it has an amazing twist!"
d_ex_church_02_56,I'd have to wait until next week for the re-run.
d_ex_church_02_57,It might end up getting spoiled for me...
d_ex_church_02_58,so I downloaded it illegally.
d_ex_church_02_59,Illegal download? How do you do that?
d_ex_church_02_60,There's a download site where people upload TV shows.
d_ex_church_02_61,"Once an episode airs, it goes straight onto the net."
d_ex_church_02_62,"All you do is pay with some of your credits,"
d_ex_church_02_63,and you can download it right then and there.
d_ex_church_02_64,"I was unable to resist the temptation, and I downloaded the final episode."
d_ex_church_02_65,"After downloading it, did you watch it?"
d_ex_church_02_66,N-no! I haven't.
d_ex_church_02_67,"But even though I downloaded it,"
d_ex_church_02_68,"I still shouldn't watch it, right?"
d_ex_church_02_69,You could get caught by the police.
d_ex_church_02_70,You are right. You must delete it.
d_ex_church_02_71,The police?!
d_ex_church_02_72,But all I did was download it! I didn't actually watch it!
d_ex_church_02_73,"I won't do it again,"
d_ex_church_02_74,I promise!
d_ex_church_02_75,This is the first time I've done something like this!
d_ex_church_02_76,I-I'll go and delete it right now!
d_ex_church_02_77,That's what I thought...
d_ex_church_02_78,I should wait for the re-run.
d_ex_church_02_79,I'll delete the file when I get back.
d_ex_church_02_80,I won't get caught will I? Would I have to pay a fine?
d_ex_church_02_81,Signal is a nervous wreck and continues talking.
d_ex_church_02_82,"While listening to Signal go on, I keep prying at the crevice of the door."
d_ex_church_02_83,*Clank*
d_ex_church_02_84,"Finally, the door opens."
d_ex_church_02_85,What should I do? Will I be forgiven for this transgression?
d_ex_church_02_86,I should wrap this up and get out of here.
d_ex_church_02_87,"It is possible, yes."
d_ex_church_02_88,Really?! What must I do?
d_ex_church_02_89,Stay here and listen to the other Nikkes vent for a while.
d_ex_church_02_90,What? Me?
d_ex_church_02_91,"Yes, at least 10 of them."
d_ex_church_02_92,That many?!
d_ex_church_02_93,...
d_ex_church_02_94,I leave behind a flabbergasted Signal as I head away from the church.
d_ex_church_02_95,Um... Creator... are you still here?
d_ex_church_02_96,Are you really gone?
d_ex_church_02_97,Guess I'll watch some other shows in the meantime!
d_ex_church_02_98,"After that day, rumors circulated about the Creator in the church"
d_ex_church_02_99,who was a very good listener.
d_ex_church_03_title,Folkwang and the Witch's Elixir
d_ex_church_03_1,"Oh, Creator!"
d_ex_church_03_2,"Can you please cure me of this ailment, of this sweating?"
d_ex_church_03_3,"It would be a great act of humanitarianism... No, wait... Nikketarianism... Anyway, I can't go on like this!"
d_ex_church_03_4,Why must I sit here drenched in my own sweat
d_ex_church_03_5,while the other Nikkes are as dry as a bone? Why?
d_ex_church_03_6,"I beg of you, please spare me from this affliction and make me perspire no longer!"
d_ex_church_03_7,... Folkwang?
d_ex_church_03_8,Save your prayers. The Creator won't listen.
d_ex_church_03_9,!!
d_ex_church_03_10,You scared me... who is that beside you?
d_ex_church_03_11,A Nikke with excessive perspiration...
d_ex_church_03_12,Huh?
d_ex_church_03_13,"Your wish. You want to stop sweating so much, am I right?"
d_ex_church_03_14,"Well... yes, but..."
d_ex_church_03_15,If you don't want to sweat...
d_ex_church_03_16,Hmm...
d_ex_church_03_17,You're lucky I have nothing else going on right now.
d_ex_church_03_18,I'll prepare a unique potion for you.
d_ex_church_03_19,!!
d_ex_church_03_20,You mean... you can cure me?
d_ex_church_03_21,"I turned to science for a cure, but it wasn't any help..."
d_ex_church_03_22,"Hehe, a witch's elixir trumps any of your so-called science."
d_ex_church_03_23,What did you say?
d_ex_church_03_24,That's right. A witch's elixir.
d_ex_church_03_25,"Use it correctly, and it will free from all your woes, my clammy compadre."
d_ex_church_03_26,...
d_ex_church_03_27,"Well, are you up for it?"
d_ex_church_03_28,Yes! Let me try!
d_ex_church_03_29,A moment later.
d_ex_church_03_30,*Gurgle gurgle gurgle*
d_ex_church_03_31,A suspicious green liquid bubbles in the huge cauldron.
d_ex_church_03_32,...
d_ex_church_03_33,...
d_ex_church_03_34,"Come, drink this."
d_ex_church_03_35,Um...
d_ex_church_03_36,Are you sure it's safe?
d_ex_church_03_37,"You're not doubting me, are you?"
d_ex_church_03_38,"Don't you pray to gods you've never even met before? If you're so devout, take some of that faith and place it in me, you sweaty fool."
d_ex_church_03_39,It's not my fault that I sweat so much...
d_ex_church_03_40,"If you're not willing to, I won't force you to drink it. Then you can go crawling back to that oh-so-mighty god of yours."
d_ex_church_03_41,And I'll dump this out.
d_ex_church_03_42,"No, don't! I'll drink it!"
d_ex_church_03_43,"I can drink with a ladle, right?"
d_ex_church_03_44,"Folkwang takes the ladle, scoops up some of the green liquid, and proceeds to drink it."
d_ex_church_03_45,*Gulp*
d_ex_church_03_46,...?!
d_ex_church_03_47,Folkwang?
d_ex_church_03_48,Wow! This is much tastier than I thought it'd be.
d_ex_church_03_49,The neon green may be a bit off-putting...
d_ex_church_03_50,but it is delicious!
d_ex_church_03_51,Who do you take me for?
d_ex_church_03_52,I'd never survive at the top of the food chain if I didn't know how to cook.
d_ex_church_03_53,"Wow, that's amazing!"
d_ex_church_03_54,"Finally, some respect. That's more like it."
d_ex_church_03_55,"Anyway, enough talk. Let's see if the elixir had any effect."
d_ex_church_03_56,"Run over there, then come back."
d_ex_church_03_57,Sure thing! Be right back!
d_ex_church_03_58,Folkwang takes off.
d_ex_church_03_59,"A resounding ""Impossible!"" can be heard off in the distance."
d_ex_church_03_60,Folkwang runs back.
d_ex_church_03_61,"So, how do you feel?"
d_ex_church_03_62,This is incredible!
d_ex_church_03_63,All that running would have had me sweating up a storm before!
d_ex_church_03_64,But now I'm bone dry! Not a drop of sweat on me!
d_ex_church_03_65,It's a miracle!
d_ex_church_03_66,I told you.
d_ex_church_03_67,This is what witches are capable of.
d_ex_church_03_68,"From now on, if you want anything, pray to the witches."
d_ex_church_03_69,"If you manage to pique their curiosity, I guarantee they'll make your prayers come true."
d_ex_church_03_70,Absolutely! I'll pray to the witches from now on!
d_ex_church_03_71,That's what I like to hear.
d_ex_church_03_72,Harran scoops up another spoonful of the green liquid.
d_ex_church_03_73,"Come, drink some more, and don't forget that it is all thanks to me."
d_ex_church_03_74,The great witch Harran gives you special permission.
d_ex_church_03_75,Yes! Master Witch! I will free myself from this torment!
d_ex_church_03_76,Folkwang takes the elixir from Harran and wolfs it down.
d_ex_church_03_77,She continues gulping down the elixir until the bottom of the cauldron is visible.
d_ex_church_03_78,"... Several days later, Folkwang sent me a message."
d_ex_church_03_79,She said she was sweating again.
d_ex_church_03_80,"Once again, she began to pray to the gods."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_title,Lemongrass Tea
d_ex_clothingstore_01_1,*Ding*
d_ex_clothingstore_01_2,"Finally, a customer!"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_3,Come on in.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_4,Welcome to the Northern Closet.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_5,Cool name!
d_ex_clothingstore_01_6,"Hey Commander,"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_7,fancy seeing you here.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_8,Welcome.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_9,You think so?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_10,I'm glad you like it.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_11,Are you looking for anything specific?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_12,I wanted to find some clothing that I can give to children.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_13,How old are they?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_14,"10 or 11, give or take."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_15,I see.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_16,You could try visiting some of the markets near Royal Road. You might find something there.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_17,Royal Road?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_18,You mean I can't just buy them here?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_19,Of course not!
d_ex_clothingstore_01_20,We do not sell clothing of any kind
d_ex_clothingstore_01_21,here at Northern Closet.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_22,Huh?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_23,You don't?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_24,No. You must realize closets are not merely for storing clothes.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_25,Closets have long been a
d_ex_clothingstore_01_26,"kind of safe haven for children,"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_27,or even portals into new worlds.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_28,"I'm not sure how this place operates when Alice is here,"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_29,"but since I'm here, it's tea time."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_30,"Well, how about it?"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_31,Would you like some tea?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_32,"Oh, well... erm..."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_33,Any specific tea that you enjoy?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_34,I'm not really a big tea buff...
d_ex_clothingstore_01_35,Is there a tea that smells... refreshing? Like orange or something?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_36,"Hmm, refreshing..."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_37,"All right then, lemongrass tea it is."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_38,"Get to it, Servant."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_39,I go fetch the tea leaves and kettle.
d_ex_clothingstore_01_40,"Ludmilla boils the tea leaves, then takes a cup of tea and places it in front of Pepper."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_41,"Wow, the color sure looks nice."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_42,"Smells good, too!"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_43,Do you like it?
d_ex_clothingstore_01_44,This is my first time having a proper cup of tea!
d_ex_clothingstore_01_45,"Ha, well I hope you enjoy it."
d_ex_clothingstore_01_46,"We spend some laid-back time together,"
d_ex_clothingstore_01_47,as the scent of lemongrass hangs in the air.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_title,Story of the Hatter
d_ex_clothingstore_02_1,"Hey there, Old-Timer. Did you bring anything to eat?"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_2,Rabbity!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_3,"Hey, good to see you!"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_4,"When I enter the clothing shop,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_5,"a mysterious white powder is flying everywhere,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_6,and a menagerie of colorful fabrics lay scattered about.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_7,"It is, in other words... a complete mess."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_8,"Hey, check this out!"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_9,Alice is practically beaming as she shows me
d_ex_clothingstore_02_10,dolls with tangled mats of hair and their clothes put on backwards.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_11,Belorta and Mica get them for me.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_12,They're not supposed to look like that...
d_ex_clothingstore_02_13,Aren't they great?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_14,They are.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_15,Not really.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_16,I knew you'd love them!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_17,Huh? You don't think so?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_18,"Hey, look over here."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_19,"As soon as I turn around to look at Belorta,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_20,a pile of red tea leaves lands on top of me.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_21,"As the tea leaves atop my head rustle to the ground,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_22,several of them land inside my nostrils.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_23,Hahaha! That's a good look for you!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_24,If only you had a hat! Then you'd look just like the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_25,Hahaha right?!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_26,"Belorta, Mica and Alice all roar with laughter."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_27,I look at the time. Ludmilla will be here soon.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_28,I should tell them to clean up.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_29,What should we do now?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_30,We should stop and start cleaning...
d_ex_clothingstore_02_31,Why don't we add a few more accessories?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_32,Nice! That sounds fun!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_33,Yeah! Time for some decoration!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_34,"All three of them move towards me, their eyes filled with glee."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_35,"Belorta and Mica are brandishing colorful pens and fabrics,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_36,whereas Alice is holding a hat.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_37,"I start to get nervous and try to move back, but I can't escape."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_38,Soon after.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_39,Ta-da♡. You're a perfect Mad Hatter!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_40,The spitting image!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_41,"How about a tea party, then?"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_42,What do you think?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_43,Belorta brings a mirror and holds it up for me to see.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_44,"I look like a homeless circus clown,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_45,with a ridiculous hat to match.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_46,It's fantastic.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_47,What have you done to me?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_48,This is so much fun!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_49,"I'm always cooped up in that boring old toy shop,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_50,"but this place is a blast! Isn't that right, Mica?"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_51,It sure is!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_52,"Aw c'mon, we put a lot of thought into this getup."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_53,Don't be such a wet blanket!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_54,But that hat suits you perfectly!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_55,"Geez, I'm starving! Coming here without a single thing to eat..."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_56,Who does that?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_57,I'm hungry too.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_58,Belorta and Mica sit on the floor and stare at me.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_59,"If they eat here, they're bound to get food poisoning."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_60,We can't eat here.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_61,Why not?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_62,"Yeah, why not?"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_63,I'm hungry too...
d_ex_clothingstore_02_64,This place is filthy.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_65,What? This place is immaculate!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_66,Yeah! Clean as a whistle!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_67,"You don't actually think this is dirty, do you?"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_68,...
d_ex_clothingstore_02_69,*Clank*
d_ex_clothingstore_02_70,"As I bicker with the three of them, I hear the door swing open."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_71,Ludmilla enters.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_72,"My Queen, you're back!"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_73,...
d_ex_clothingstore_02_74,She seems rather shocked.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_75,Look at this!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_76,We turned Rabbity into the Mad Hatter!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_77,"Alice, beaming with pride, shows me off to Ludmilla."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_78,Ludmilla looks at me.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_79,Smile awkwardly.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_80,Dance.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_81,Is this all a joke to you?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_82,You look like a crazy person.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_83,Alice.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_84,Yes!
d_ex_clothingstore_02_85,Did you enjoy yourself?
d_ex_clothingstore_02_86,Absolutely! It's been a total blast.
d_ex_clothingstore_02_87,"Mmm, that's good then."
d_ex_clothingstore_02_88,"Ludmilla flashes a grin, as if throwing her hands up in the air,"
d_ex_clothingstore_02_89,and we proceed to have a lovely tea party.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_title,The Weird World of Drake
d_ex_clothingstore_03_1,Anyone here?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_2,"The Ultimate Villain, Drake is here!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_3,"Wow, Ultimate Villain?"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_4,Neato!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_5,"Well well, look who's here. You're too kind, hehehe!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_6,What brings you two here?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_7,We came to get some clothes for Drake.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_8,You don't say...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_9,I do say.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_10,People have been getting a little too chummy with me.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_11,How's that supposed to make a dastardly fiend like myself feel?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_12,"Don't mind them, they're all fools!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_13,You're still the ultimate in villainy.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_14,Why'd you called them fools?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_15,You don't have to be so mean about it!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_16,"Please, no need to state the obvious!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_17,"When it comes to villainy, there is no other!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_18,I need to strike fear in people's hearts the moment they see me.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_19,That's why I came to see some clothes.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_20,Mwahahahaha!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_21,"Hmm... in that case, this may not be the best store for you."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_22,My Queen!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_23,We don't have much clothing suited for villains.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_24,!!!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_25,You don't have anything for villains?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_26,Umm... My Queen...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_27,Perhaps we could use the clothes we do have
d_ex_clothingstore_03_28,to fix something up for our fiendish friend?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_29,!!!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_30,I want you to make me into someone to be feared.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_31,"Alice, are you sure about this?"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_32,Why not? I'd love to cook something up for Madame Villainess.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_33,I'd hate to have her leave empty-handed.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_34,Very good!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_35,I'm glad you can accommodate me.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_36,I'll let you get to it.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_37,"You're not serious, are you?"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_38,Of course I am!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_39,I could use a change.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_40,"Oh boy, I'm so excited!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_41,Me too!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_42,Are you sure this is okay?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_43,Alice seems happy enough. Let's see what happens.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_44,Madame Villainess
d_ex_clothingstore_03_45,Wah-lah!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_46,"With this, you can be the finest rabbit villain of them all!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_47,R-rabbit villain?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_48,Pfff...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_49,P... pffff...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_50,Nobody laughs!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_51,Isn't it adorable?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_52,I'm allergic to rabbits...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_53,"Oh, really?"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_54,It looks like Alice is sad.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_55,No doubt she is a villain.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_56,That's too bad.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_57,I'd have liked to see a rabbit defeat the Queen of Hearts...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_58,Don't you have anything else?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_59,"Hmm, let me think..."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_60,How about a cute puppy mask?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_61,"I kinda like dogs, so I'd rather not..."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_62,How about this then?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_63,Aren't these frills just the cutest thing?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_64,Umm... I'm also allergic to frills...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_65,Or what about these suspenders?!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_66,It's even got a Cheshire Cat pattern!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_67,I have a phobia of cats.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_68,This one's my favorite.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_69,...
d_ex_clothingstore_03_70,"Madame Villainess, how about..."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_71,I-I think I should be going!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_72,Huh?
d_ex_clothingstore_03_73,But I haven't found anything for you yet.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_74,I just remembered that I have an important meeting!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_75,I absolutely have to attend.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_76,"If I leave now, I should still make it on time."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_77,"One day, I'll wear something you've recommended, promise."
d_ex_clothingstore_03_78,Mwahahahaha!
d_ex_clothingstore_03_79,"Well, I'll be off then!"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_80,Drake races out of the store.
d_ex_clothingstore_03_81,"I'll have more prepared for your next time,"
d_ex_clothingstore_03_82,Madame Villainess!

d_ex_command_01_5,I lie down on the bed gently.

d_ex_command_01_12,Neon opens the door and walks in.
d_ex_command_01_13,She is completely covered in filth.
d_ex_command_01_14,"Master, how do I look?"
d_ex_command_01_15,... I wouldn't even dare to look.
d_ex_command_01_16,Right?
d_ex_command_01_17,"There was no water in the bathroom in our dorm, so I tried to fix the pipes and ended up like this."
d_ex_command_01_18,I also wasn't able to fix anything. We still have no water.
d_ex_command_01_19,"So, I came here to take a bath."
d_ex_command_01_20,I'm sure your bathroom's water is fine.
d_ex_command_01_21,I see.
d_ex_command_01_22,"Thanks a lot, Master."
d_ex_command_01_23,*Swoosh*
d_ex_command_01_24,30 minutes later.
d_ex_command_01_25,Ha... This feels so good.
d_ex_command_01_26,Thanks for letting me use your bathroom. I'm going back.
d_ex_command_01_27,Go ahead.
d_ex_command_01_28,"Okay. Have a good rest, Master."
d_ex_command_01_29,Neon bows and leaves.
d_ex_command_01_30,The room is quiet again.
d_ex_command_01_31,So bedtime again...
d_ex_command_01_32,...
d_ex_command_01_33,Commander!!
d_ex_command_01_34,??
d_ex_command_01_35,"It's unfair!
It can't be only Neon who gets to borrow your bathroom!"
d_ex_command_01_36,"I want to use it too!
BATH-ROOM!"
d_ex_command_01_37,"Okay, just use it."
d_ex_command_01_38,Don't mind if I do!
d_ex_command_01_39,*Swoosh*
d_ex_command_01_40,Whoa! Hot water!
d_ex_command_01_41,*Patter patter patter*
d_ex_command_01_42,La la la ♪ La la la la la ♪
d_ex_command_01_43,Nikke ♪ saying hello to you ♪
d_ex_command_01_44,Nikke Nikke Ni... ♪
d_ex_command_01_45,*Swoosh*
d_ex_command_01_46,"Niiiiiiii... ♪
KKeeeeee... ♪"
d_ex_command_01_47,...
d_ex_command_01_48,Anis' noisy bath time lasts for an hour.
d_ex_command_01_49,"Ah, feels so good!"
d_ex_command_01_50,"Commander, do you have anything to drink?"
d_ex_command_01_51,... You can check the refrigerator.
d_ex_command_01_52,"Oh, is that soda? My, my, my. You've got good stuff in here!"
d_ex_command_01_53,"This is so nice of you, Commander! You're so cool!"
d_ex_command_01_54,*Gulp gulp gulp*
d_ex_command_01_55,Aaahh!
d_ex_command_01_56,"Ah, so nice!"
d_ex_command_01_57,Can I come again next time?
d_ex_command_01_58,... Yes.
d_ex_command_01_59,"Thanks. Sleep tight, Commander."
d_ex_command_01_60,Anis leaves.
d_ex_command_01_61,... It's quiet again.
d_ex_command_01_62,"Finally, I can sleep..."
d_ex_command_01_63,*Knock knock*
d_ex_command_01_64,Commander? I am coming in.
d_ex_command_01_65,...
d_ex_command_01_66,Sorry to bother you...
d_ex_command_01_67,... Just use it.
d_ex_command_01_68,... Huh?
d_ex_command_01_69,... You can use my bathroom.
d_ex_command_01_70,"... Thanks for your concern, but now's not the time."
d_ex_command_01_71,We have 30 minutes until the start of the operation.
d_ex_command_01_72,Please get ready and come downstairs ASAP.
d_ex_command_01_73,See you.
d_ex_command_01_74,Rapi leaves the room.
d_ex_command_01_75,...
d_ex_command_01_76,Let me take a bath first.
d_ex_command_01_77,*Creak creak*
d_ex_command_01_78,*Swoosh*
d_ex_command_01_79,...
d_ex_command_01_80,All the hot water has been used up.
d_ex_command_02_title,Surprise Party
d_ex_command_02_1,There is an important meeting today.
d_ex_command_02_2,"It went longer than expected, but finally, I can return to my room after having dinner."
d_ex_command_02_3,I'm exhausted. Need to take a shower right aw...
d_ex_command_02_4,*Pop* *Pop pop pop*
d_ex_command_02_5,Happy birthday!
d_ex_command_02_6,Happy birthday!!
d_ex_command_02_7,Happy birthday.
d_ex_command_02_8,?!?!
d_ex_command_02_9,"Judging by the look on your face, you didn't expect a thing."
d_ex_command_02_10,"It's a surprise birthday party, just for you!"
d_ex_command_02_11,Birthday...?
d_ex_command_02_12,"Now then, time to hand out the presents!"
d_ex_command_02_13,Everyone says a few words as they hand over their clumsily wrapped gifts.
d_ex_command_02_14,"It's been a long time since I've gotten a gift for anyone, so I put a lot of thought into it..."
d_ex_command_02_15,And I came to the conclusion that nothing is better than firepower!
d_ex_command_02_16,"It's something near and dear to my heart,
so make sure you open it when no one else is around."
d_ex_command_02_17,You should have told us it's your birthday!
d_ex_command_02_18,I was running around like a headless chicken getting this present ready.
d_ex_command_02_19,"It's nothing expensive, so don't get too excited."
d_ex_command_02_20,I hope you like what I got you.
d_ex_command_02_21,"We're not being deployed tomorrow,
so you can sit back and relax."
d_ex_command_02_22,"Happy birthday, Commander."
d_ex_command_02_23,Rapi carefully carries out a cake with candles on it.
d_ex_command_02_24,You can thank Emma for the cake.
d_ex_command_02_25,I bumped into her on the way of buying a cake.
d_ex_command_02_26,But she insisted on making it herself.
d_ex_command_02_27,She was so bummed that she couldn't
d_ex_command_02_28,be here in person.
d_ex_command_02_29,W-wait...
d_ex_command_02_30,"Quick, before the candles go out."
d_ex_command_02_31,Candle wax is melting and slowly dripping onto the cake.
d_ex_command_02_32,I should blow out the candles first.
d_ex_command_02_33,Pfffoooo!
d_ex_command_02_34,All the candles go out.
d_ex_command_02_35,Then!!
d_ex_command_02_36,Wait!
d_ex_command_02_37,What is all this?
d_ex_command_02_38,You look really shocked! Haha!
d_ex_command_02_39,"But then again, it is a surprise party."
d_ex_command_02_40,I saw that you'd circled the
d_ex_command_02_41,date on your calendar.
d_ex_command_02_42,You only do that if it's a special day.
d_ex_command_02_43,So I figured it must be your birthday!
d_ex_command_02_44,Isn't that right?
d_ex_command_02_45,It's my birthday.
d_ex_command_02_46,It's not my birthday.
d_ex_command_02_47,I knew I could count on my intuition!
d_ex_command_02_48,You're such a blank slate right now. I was worried it wasn't your birthday.
d_ex_command_02_49,We all spent a lot of time getting everything ready in time.
d_ex_command_02_50,Should we continue then?
d_ex_command_02_51,We've saved the best part for last.
d_ex_command_02_52,"... All right, go ahead."
d_ex_command_02_53,"Wait, it's not your birthday?"
d_ex_command_02_54,Then what was that date you circled on your calendar?
d_ex_command_02_55,It was because I had an important meeting today.
d_ex_command_02_56,A... meeting?
d_ex_command_02_57,I'm going to use a red heart to mark the days when we have to leave on an assignment.
d_ex_command_02_58,"Well, we did go through all this trouble getting you these gifts..."
d_ex_command_02_59,"Let's just make today your birthday. What do you say, Commander?"
d_ex_command_02_60,"Yeah, today's your new birthday!"
d_ex_command_02_61,...
d_ex_command_02_62,"Or if you'd prefer, we can just call it a surprise party."
d_ex_command_02_63,It's important to enjoy yourself every once in a while.
d_ex_command_02_64,"... All right, go ahead."
d_ex_command_02_65,Yay! Then let's do this!
d_ex_command_02_66,Neon immediately lifts up the cake as if to throw it.
d_ex_command_02_67,"Wait, what are you going to do with the cake?"
d_ex_command_02_68,"Toss it, of course."
d_ex_command_02_69,We can't eat a cake that Emma made.
d_ex_command_02_70,*Splat*
d_ex_command_02_71,...
d_ex_command_02_72,The cake lands directly on my face.
d_ex_command_02_73,I've always wanted to do that!
d_ex_command_02_74,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the main event!"
d_ex_command_02_75,"You should see your face, Commander! Hahahaha!"
d_ex_command_02_76,...
d_ex_command_02_77,You girls will be the death of me...
d_ex_command_02_78,"Huh? W-wait, Master-"
d_ex_command_02_79,Ach!
d_ex_command_02_80,I grab a handful of cake that's fallen on the floor and toss it at Neon.
d_ex_command_02_81,"Aw man, I just took a shower before you got back..."
d_ex_command_02_82,Food fight!
d_ex_command_02_83,The party quickly turns into a wild food fight.
d_ex_command_02_84,"Later that night, we all had to clean up the Commander's Room together."
d_ex_command_03_title,Nocturnal Reverie
d_ex_command_03_1,"It is a dark night, and a biting chill has fallen."
d_ex_command_03_2,There is a knock on the door which cuts through the silence.
d_ex_command_03_3,*Knock knock*
d_ex_command_03_4,...?
d_ex_command_03_5,Come in.
d_ex_command_03_6,*Zing*
d_ex_command_03_7,It's meeee!
d_ex_command_03_8,I got the note you sent me.
d_ex_command_03_9,I can hardly believe you called for me so late at night.
d_ex_command_03_10,I see you're finally ready to spend the night together!
d_ex_command_03_11,I called you?
d_ex_command_03_12,"Haha, don't be shy."
d_ex_command_03_13,"Now, then..."
d_ex_command_03_14,"Should we get started? It is rather late, after all."
d_ex_command_03_15,Isabel's hands began to slip under my shirt.
d_ex_command_03_16,W-wait...!
d_ex_command_03_17,Hm? What's wrong?
d_ex_command_03_18,Oh...!
d_ex_command_03_19,"I'm sorry, I was too hasty."
d_ex_command_03_20,I'll go wash up. Just wait here for a bit.
d_ex_command_03_21,Isabel ties my wrists with some string.
d_ex_command_03_22,!!
d_ex_command_03_23,"I know you won't be running away from your own room,"
d_ex_command_03_24,"but if I didn't do this, I'd feel nervous."
d_ex_command_03_25,"You understand, right?"
d_ex_command_03_26,*Peck*
d_ex_command_03_27,"Just a moment, my love."
d_ex_command_03_28,Isabel goes into the shower.
d_ex_command_03_29,*Splash*
d_ex_command_03_30,I can hear Isabel showering from where I'm sitting.
d_ex_command_03_31,*Knock knock*
d_ex_command_03_32,?!
d_ex_command_03_33,"Before I could figure out what was going on,
another knock could be heard."
d_ex_command_03_34,"Believer, I'm coming in."
d_ex_command_03_35,"No, not now!"
d_ex_command_03_36,*Zing*
d_ex_command_03_37,"Didn't keep you waiting, did I?"
d_ex_command_03_38,"My apologies, I was somewhat taken aback by your note."
d_ex_command_03_39,I didn't realize you were so... forward.
d_ex_command_03_40,"Well then, shall we begin?"
d_ex_command_03_41,Gasp...!
d_ex_command_03_42,What is this on your wrist?!
d_ex_command_03_43,And your shirt is open!
d_ex_command_03_44,"Help me get this off, will you?"
d_ex_command_03_45,I didn't realize you were into this kind of thing.
d_ex_command_03_46,"Sure, I'll help remove it for you, hehehe!"
d_ex_command_03_47,Rapunzel starts to undo my shirt buttons one by one.
d_ex_command_03_48,I didn't mean those!
d_ex_command_03_49,"Oh come now, it's more fun this way."
d_ex_command_03_50,Rapunzel's eyes are glazed over as if in a trance.
d_ex_command_03_51,*Stomp* *Stomp*
d_ex_command_03_52,...!
d_ex_command_03_53,The sound of footsteps approaching from far away.
d_ex_command_03_54,I can't let myself be seen like this!
d_ex_command_03_55,"Rapunzel, get under the covers."
d_ex_command_03_56,...!
d_ex_command_03_57,"You really don't waste time, do you?"
d_ex_command_03_58,Under no circumstances can you come out from under the covers.
d_ex_command_03_59,My oh my... just what kind of a night do you have planned for me?
d_ex_command_03_60,"Take as much time as you need, I'll wait."
d_ex_command_03_61,"I'll stay under the covers, no matter what."
d_ex_command_03_62,*Knock knock*
d_ex_command_03_63,"As soon as Rapunzel is under the covers, there is another knock at the door."
d_ex_command_03_64,Will this ever end?
d_ex_command_03_65,*Zing*
d_ex_command_03_66,"Hey, Rookie! I came as soon as I finished work."
d_ex_command_03_67,"Got held up in meetings, you know how it is."
d_ex_command_03_68,Huh?
d_ex_command_03_69,What's going on here?
d_ex_command_03_70,What's with the rope? And your shirt is half open...
d_ex_command_03_71,Get over here and undo this thing.
d_ex_command_03_72,"No need to rush, the night is still young!"
d_ex_command_03_73,Let me take a shower first...
d_ex_command_03_74,*Splash*
d_ex_command_03_75,Hmm?
d_ex_command_03_76,Is the shower already running?
d_ex_command_03_77,You didn't...
d_ex_command_03_78,Just trying to set the mood.
d_ex_command_03_79,I forgot to turn it off.
d_ex_command_03_80,"Well, I suppose hearing the shower running"
d_ex_command_03_81,in the background does lend a certain atmosphere.
d_ex_command_03_82,So absent-minded! You really must not want to waste any time!
d_ex_command_03_83,"You're quite the sly old fox, you know that?"
d_ex_command_03_84,"Well then, let me ""help"" you as you asked."
d_ex_command_03_85,Yan undoes the rest of the buttons on my shirt.
d_ex_command_03_86,W-wait!
d_ex_command_03_87,What's wrong?
d_ex_command_03_88,... Please get out...!
d_ex_command_03_89,Huh?
d_ex_command_03_90,...
d_ex_command_03_91,Oh!
d_ex_command_03_92,You naughty little devil! It'll be too cold outside.
d_ex_command_03_93,"Then again, it's the middle of the night, so no one will see."
d_ex_command_03_94,I'll play along.
d_ex_command_03_95,Let's go to the rooftop.
d_ex_command_03_96,That's not what I meant!
d_ex_command_03_97,Yan smiles widely and opens the door leading to the hallway.
d_ex_command_03_98,*Zing*
d_ex_command_03_99,*Zing*
d_ex_command_03_100,Privaty?
d_ex_command_03_101,Y-Yan? What are you doing here?
d_ex_command_03_102,I could ask you the same thing!
d_ex_command_03_103,The Commander asked me to come.
d_ex_command_03_104,What?
d_ex_command_03_105,"You're a fox all right, the most cunning of them all!"
d_ex_command_03_106,I'm not the only one you called over?
d_ex_command_03_107,It's not what you think...
d_ex_command_03_108,"Oh, Oh my gosh..."
d_ex_command_03_109,Commander! What is going on here?
d_ex_command_03_110,You didn't...
d_ex_command_03_111,"already start with Yan before I arrived, did you?"
d_ex_command_03_112,I'm afraid not.
d_ex_command_03_113,"We were about to head outside for some fun, then I ran into you."
d_ex_command_03_114,What of it?
d_ex_command_03_115,Hmph...
d_ex_command_03_116,"I didn't know it would be the three of us, but I'm not opposed to it."
d_ex_command_03_117,Let's go.
d_ex_command_03_118,???
d_ex_command_03_119,Wait.
d_ex_command_03_120,"I'm sorry, I know you told me to stay under the covers."
d_ex_command_03_121,But I need an explanation.
d_ex_command_03_122,...
d_ex_command_03_123,I see you're quite popular with the ladies.
d_ex_command_03_124,I need to take you somewhere so we can be alone.
d_ex_command_03_125,"Please, everyone calm down!"
d_ex_command_03_126,The four Nikkes start coming closer.
d_ex_command_03_127,"With my hands tied, I'm doomed."
d_ex_command_03_128,P-please...!
d_ex_command_03_129,*Bang*
d_ex_command_03_130,...der!
d_ex_command_03_131,...mander! Are you... okay?
d_ex_command_03_132,"Commander, are you awake?"
d_ex_command_03_133,... Rapi?
d_ex_command_03_134,"Yes, Commander."
d_ex_command_03_135,Rapi? She wasn't here before...
d_ex_command_03_136,Yes?
d_ex_command_03_137,"I heard a loud banging sound, so I came rushing over."
d_ex_command_03_138,It looks like you fell from your bed. Are you okay?
d_ex_command_03_139,Was it all a...?
d_ex_command_03_140,Did you have a bad dream?
d_ex_command_03_141,...
d_ex_command_03_142,I decided to take this dream to the grave.
d_ex_court_01_title,The Sweating Scam
d_ex_court_01_1,*Tap tap tap* *Tap tap tap*
d_ex_court_01_2,Yulha incessantly taps away at her tablet.
d_ex_court_01_3,...
d_ex_court_01_4,...
d_ex_court_01_5,What are you looking at?
d_ex_court_01_6,Can't you see I'm busy? Come back later.
d_ex_court_01_7,Need any help?
d_ex_court_01_8,No. It's all part of my job.
d_ex_court_01_9,*Knock knock*
d_ex_court_01_10,"Phew, it's boiling in here! Excuse me."
d_ex_court_01_11,"Oh, Coach! Hi there."
d_ex_court_01_12,Would you keep it down?
d_ex_court_01_13,"Sorry, but is this the Outpost courthouse?"
d_ex_court_01_14,I heard you can reach a verdict here super quick.
d_ex_court_01_15,No. Get out.
d_ex_court_01_16,"Oh, really? Jeez, it's like an oven in here."
d_ex_court_01_17,"Weird, didn't it say courthouse on the front of the building?"
d_ex_court_01_18,Maybe the heat's making me see things.
d_ex_court_01_19,Later.
d_ex_court_01_20,Folkwang leaves.
d_ex_court_01_21,...
d_ex_court_01_22,*Tap tap tap* *Tap tap tap*
d_ex_court_01_23,Hey!
d_ex_court_01_24,"Man, I'm sweating bullets! This is the courthouse all right."
d_ex_court_01_25,It says so right there.
d_ex_court_01_26,"So take it down then, because this is not the court anymore from now on."
d_ex_court_01_27,Huh?
d_ex_court_01_28,But this is the only place that can help me.
d_ex_court_01_29,I was scammed!
d_ex_court_01_30,And whose fault is that?
d_ex_court_01_31,"Hey, what's your problem?! I'm a victim! I'm not the one in the wrong here!"
d_ex_court_01_32,It's not like I wanted to get scammed.
d_ex_court_01_33,You were scammed?
d_ex_court_01_34,"Yeah... I bought something, but it turned out to be fake."
d_ex_court_01_35,...
d_ex_court_01_36,"Ugh, first I'm sweating, now I'm crying. I'm gonna get dehydrated at this rate."
d_ex_court_01_37,*Tap*
d_ex_court_01_38,I'm about on my last nerve...
d_ex_court_01_39,"Fine, who did it?"
d_ex_court_01_40,"Wait, you're actually gonna hear me out?"
d_ex_court_01_41,"Yes, I'll listen, so get on with it."
d_ex_court_01_42,Not the best customer service...
d_ex_court_01_43,"You're so frigid, it's like I'm being cooled off. Nice..."
d_ex_court_01_44,Do I need to call security?
d_ex_court_01_45,"No, wait! I'll tell you."
d_ex_court_01_46,"A few days ago, I bought some cooling vitamins"
d_ex_court_01_47,from a nearby shopping center.
d_ex_court_01_48,They told me it'd be really good for me.
d_ex_court_01_49,"Not only that, it'll apparently reduce your body heat, so I was sold."
d_ex_court_01_50,But my body temperature hasn't gone down at all!
d_ex_court_01_51,How can you be so sure?
d_ex_court_01_52,Just look at all this sweat!
d_ex_court_01_53,"Folkwang, don't you sweat a lot normally?"
d_ex_court_01_54,"Yes, but they said that'd only make the vitamins more effective."
d_ex_court_01_55,They were supposed to cool me down!
d_ex_court_01_56,But they haven't.
d_ex_court_01_57,"If anything, I'm getting more heated at the thought of being scammed!"
d_ex_court_01_58,"If this isn't fraud, what else could it be?"
d_ex_court_01_59,Do you even have a brain between those ears of yours?
d_ex_court_01_60,"You're a Nikke, aren't you?"
d_ex_court_01_61,What does that have to do with anything?
d_ex_court_01_62,Is that medicine made for Nikkes?
d_ex_court_01_63,"Ha, what a silly question!"
d_ex_court_01_64,... I'm not sure.
d_ex_court_01_65,And you didn't think to ask?
d_ex_court_01_66,That medicine probably only works for humans.
d_ex_court_01_67,"Not only that, you sweat a lot to begin with."
d_ex_court_01_68,You think popping a few pills is going to fix that?
d_ex_court_01_69,Well I thought it would work...
d_ex_court_01_70,Have you gone to the Repair Center?
d_ex_court_01_71,... No.
d_ex_court_01_72,"When you were buying the vitamins, did you tell them"
d_ex_court_01_73,about how much you sweat?
d_ex_court_01_74,Um... no...
d_ex_court_01_75,Tell me.
d_ex_court_01_76,Does it sound like you've been scammed?
d_ex_court_01_77,Erm... maybe not.
d_ex_court_01_78,Then get lost!
d_ex_court_01_79,Quit disturbing me!
d_ex_court_01_80,Sorry!
d_ex_court_01_81,But you're really good at this.
d_ex_court_01_82,"I feel better already, thanks!"
d_ex_court_01_83,Are you still here?
d_ex_court_01_84,Great verdict.
d_ex_court_01_85,"If you thought she was icy before, it's about to be a snowstorm."
d_ex_court_01_86,"Get out, both of you!"
d_ex_court_01_87,Folkwang and I make a run for it to avoid Yulha's wrath.
d_ex_court_02_title,Courthouse Trial
d_ex_court_02_1,I had fallen asleep for only 10 minutes when the incident occurred.
d_ex_court_02_2,My precious Detective's Log was stolen from under my nose.
d_ex_court_02_3,I rushed out of the dorm to try and apprehend the culprit.
d_ex_court_02_4,That is when I encountered the three suspects outside.
d_ex_court_02_5,*Bang*
d_ex_court_02_6,Your Honor!
d_ex_court_02_7,I am not a judge!
d_ex_court_02_8,I knew this day would come... someone of your ilk would come here with some ludicrous case.
d_ex_court_02_9,I can't go without my Detective's Log!
d_ex_court_02_10,That's the reason I'm filing a formal complaint.
d_ex_court_02_11,Do you intend on prosecution?
d_ex_court_02_12,"Watson, I hate to drag you into this,"
d_ex_court_02_13,but this is an open and shut case. We'll win for sure.
d_ex_court_02_14,Then Newbie is the defense lawyer here.
d_ex_court_02_15,...?!
d_ex_court_02_16,I will not budge until a verdict is reached!
d_ex_court_02_17,"Please proceed, Your Honor!"
d_ex_court_02_18,All three of the accused are innocent. Now get out.
d_ex_court_02_19,Objection!
d_ex_court_02_20,*Sigh*
d_ex_court_02_21,"Fine. The sooner I wrap this up, the sooner you'll all be out of my hair."
d_ex_court_02_22,May all suspects please step forward.
d_ex_court_02_23,"For the sake of a thorough line of questioning, I must insist you look at them one by one."
d_ex_court_02_24,What a pain in my...
d_ex_court_02_25,"Fine, one at a time then."
d_ex_court_02_26,Yan walks into the center of the courtroom.
d_ex_court_02_27,What is this? Why have I been brought here?
d_ex_court_02_28,Is this an auction of some kind?
d_ex_court_02_29,"Yan, you walked by the dorm about 30 minutes ago,"
d_ex_court_02_30,did you not?
d_ex_court_02_31,That's correct. I had just finished a business deal and was passing by.
d_ex_court_02_32,Are there any witnesses to prove that?
d_ex_court_02_33,I'm sorry but I cannot disclose any private information pertaining to my customers.
d_ex_court_02_34,I didn't meet up with anyone else either.
d_ex_court_02_35,Then surely it was you who stole my Detective's Log!
d_ex_court_02_36,Wait!!!
d_ex_court_02_37,?!
d_ex_court_02_38,"There may be no witnesses, but there is still proof."
d_ex_court_02_39,"Yan must have evidence of her business transaction, yes?"
d_ex_court_02_40,"Hey, that's right! I have the money and a bill of sale in my bag."
d_ex_court_02_41,It was a quite a big deal.
d_ex_court_02_42,"Also, you do realize I'm a businesswoman, don't you?"
d_ex_court_02_43,"No offense, but I couldn't be less interested in this so-called Detective's Log."
d_ex_court_02_44,"Hmm, she does have a point there..."
d_ex_court_02_45,"Now, if you don't mind, I have business to attend to. I hope you find who is responsible."
d_ex_court_02_46,"That was impressive, Watson."
d_ex_court_02_47,"One down, two to go."
d_ex_court_02_48,"Next suspect, step forward."
d_ex_court_02_49,*Shatter*
d_ex_court_02_50,Laplace bursts through the window.
d_ex_court_02_51,"Have no fear, Laplace is here!"
d_ex_court_02_52,Where are the bad guys? Let me at 'em!
d_ex_court_02_53,"Laplace, you passed by the dorm about 30 minutes ago,"
d_ex_court_02_54,did you not?
d_ex_court_02_55,I can't say.
d_ex_court_02_56,A true hero never rests on their laurels. I'm always wandering here and there in order to keep the peace.
d_ex_court_02_57,I'm happy to see that everything seems in order here.
d_ex_court_02_58,So you are unable to prove your whereabouts at the time of the incident?
d_ex_court_02_59,Incident? There's been an incident?!
d_ex_court_02_60,"In front of the dorms, you said? I'm on my way!"
d_ex_court_02_61,Here I come!
d_ex_court_02_62,*Shatter*
d_ex_court_02_63,"Laplace leaps through another window, shattering the glass."
d_ex_court_02_64,!!
d_ex_court_02_65,She just fled the scene to avoid giving testimony!
d_ex_court_02_66,I believe Laplace is the culprit.
d_ex_court_02_67,That can't be true.
d_ex_court_02_68,"How can you be so sure, Watson?"
d_ex_court_02_69,Do you have any evidence to back up your claims?
d_ex_court_02_70,"If you do, please present it to the judge!"
d_ex_court_02_71,My phone.
d_ex_court_02_72,A shard of glass from the window Laplace shattered.
d_ex_court_02_73,Huh?
d_ex_court_02_74,It's just a broken piece of glass.
d_ex_court_02_75,What's so special about that?
d_ex_court_02_76,Seems this won't be of much use.
d_ex_court_02_77,My phone.
d_ex_court_02_78,What?!
d_ex_court_02_79,Does it contain evidence?
d_ex_court_02_80,I show Yulha the most recent messages on my phone.
d_ex_court_02_81,"Laid out in chronological order, they are all complaints about various windows being broken."
d_ex_court_02_82,For the past hour you've been receiving complaints about broken windows.
d_ex_court_02_83,"Approximately 30 minutes ago, you received reports of a window being broken at a building many miles away from the dorm."
d_ex_court_02_84,Hmmm.
d_ex_court_02_85,I will accept this as evidence.
d_ex_court_02_86,I also expect you to cover repair costs for the court window.
d_ex_court_02_87,... I understand.
d_ex_court_02_88,"Wow Watson, you're amazing!"
d_ex_court_02_89,We're down to the last suspect.
d_ex_court_02_90,"C'mon, let's move it along. Last suspect, step forward."
d_ex_court_02_91,N102 approaches the center of the court.
d_ex_court_02_92,Wh-where am I?
d_ex_court_02_93,My diary never mentioned this place...
d_ex_court_02_94,"N102, you passed by the dorm about 30 minutes ago,"
d_ex_court_02_95,did you not?
d_ex_court_02_96,What?
d_ex_court_02_97,"Yes, I was on my way out..."
d_ex_court_02_98,Did you happen to see my Detective's Log?
d_ex_court_02_99,What is that?
d_ex_court_02_100,It's a notebook where I jot down my findings.
d_ex_court_02_101,A notebook?
d_ex_court_02_102,I only know about my own notebook.
d_ex_court_02_103,So you mean to say you have a notebook different from mine?
d_ex_court_02_104,"Yes. I'm sorry, but I really must be going. I have to buy some flowers..."
d_ex_court_02_105,"If the court permits, may I excuse myself?"
d_ex_court_02_106,You seem a little on edge.
d_ex_court_02_107,One could even say you're acting... suspicious!
d_ex_court_02_108,It's you! You're the culprit!
d_ex_court_02_109,Objection!
d_ex_court_02_110,There's no evidence that N102 is the culprit.
d_ex_court_02_111,B-but under the circumstances...
d_ex_court_02_112,"Novel, you're better than this. Such irrational reasoning is beneath you."
d_ex_court_02_113,!!
d_ex_court_02_114,You're right.
d_ex_court_02_115,I got caught up in the moment and let my emotions get the best of me.
d_ex_court_02_116,There isn't a shred of evidence pointing to N102 being guilty.
d_ex_court_02_117,So it seems like the culprit isn't in this courtroom.
d_ex_court_02_118,... I-I need to go buy some flowers...
d_ex_court_02_119,"Your innocence is no longer in question, N102. You may leave."
d_ex_court_02_120,Phew...
d_ex_court_02_121,Thank you!
d_ex_court_02_122,"As I said, all three were innocent."
d_ex_court_02_123,"You've already wasted enough of my time, so how about you get lost."
d_ex_court_02_124,"Without a culprit, we have no case!"
d_ex_court_02_125,I need to take off my prosecutor hat and put on my investigating hat.
d_ex_court_02_126,Time to activate my sleuthing skills!
d_ex_court_02_127,...
d_ex_court_02_128,Activating...
d_ex_court_02_129,"Activated! Backwards somersault, engage!"
d_ex_court_02_130,Novel flies backwards in a spectacular fashion.
d_ex_court_02_131,At that moment...
d_ex_court_02_132,*Thud*
d_ex_court_02_133,Huh?
d_ex_court_02_134,"Hey, isn't this my Detective's Log?"
d_ex_court_02_135,"What's this doing here? Wait, does this mean..."
d_ex_court_02_136,It can't be!
d_ex_court_02_137,"Your Honor, it was you who...!"
d_ex_court_02_138,It fell out of your front pocket.
d_ex_court_02_139,Looks like your sleuthing skills aren't totally worthless after all.
d_ex_court_02_140,You recovered your precious notebook
d_ex_court_02_141,and caught the person responsible... yourself.
d_ex_court_02_142,"All right, playtime's over. Get out of my courtroom."
d_ex_court_02_143,This was a real trial of the century!
d_ex_court_02_144,"You did great back there, Watson!"
d_ex_court_02_145,We should team up and investigate others...
d_ex_court_02_146,"Scram, before I call the police!"
d_ex_court_02_147,Novel and I scramble out of the court before Yulha really calls the police.
d_ex_court_03_title,The Culprit!
d_ex_court_03_1,*Bang*
d_ex_court_03_2,"Yulha, hear me out!"
d_ex_court_03_3,"I can scarcely believe it myself,"
d_ex_court_03_4,but the Commander has been lying to me!
d_ex_court_03_5,"How could you do this to me, Commander?"
d_ex_court_03_6,"Doing this to other people would be one thing, but lying straight to my face? I trusted you!"
d_ex_court_03_7,I've done nothing of the sort.
d_ex_court_03_8,What on earth is all the commotion?
d_ex_court_03_9,The Commander borrowed some credits from me and never paid me back!
d_ex_court_03_10,What? Why would someone of your stature need to borrow money from Privaty?
d_ex_court_03_11,I've never once borrowed money from anyone in my life.
d_ex_court_03_12,"Sigh... all right, tell me everything that happened."
d_ex_court_03_13,"Okay! About an hour ago, the Commander came to me"
d_ex_court_03_14,"going on about how there was ""urgent business"" and asking if I could spare a few credits."
d_ex_court_03_15,"Apparently the Commander had a litany of problems and was in a hurry. Broken cell phone, lost wallet... you name it!"
d_ex_court_03_16,"So I figured as long as I got paid back once the cell phone was repaired, it was no big deal."
d_ex_court_03_17,So you lent the Commander all the money in one go?
d_ex_court_03_18,Yeah!
d_ex_court_03_19,Why did you do that?!
d_ex_court_03_20,"Huh? Why wouldn't I? Be-because I trusted the Commander, that's why!"
d_ex_court_03_21,... Fine. Go on.
d_ex_court_03_22,"So, later, I went to the Commander's Room to get my credit back."
d_ex_court_03_23,I figured the cell phone should have been repaired by then.
d_ex_court_03_24,So I went to the Commander's Room to try and get my credit back.
d_ex_court_03_25,But the Commander played dumb and denied ever borrowing money from me.
d_ex_court_03_26,"Which is a bald-faced lie, because I still have the message the Commander sent me on my phone!"
d_ex_court_03_27,I never sent you any messages!
d_ex_court_03_28,Stop lying!
d_ex_court_03_29,"The chat history is right here on my phone, clear as day!"
d_ex_court_03_30,"All right, let me see it then."
d_ex_court_03_31,"Sure, see for yourself!"
d_ex_court_03_32,Privaty gives her cell phone to Yulha.
d_ex_court_03_33,... This isn't Newbie's number.
d_ex_court_03_34,I figured the Commander had borrowed someone else's cell phone.
d_ex_court_03_35,"When you transferred the credits, did you check to see who was receiving the payment?"
d_ex_court_03_36,Well... apparently it was urgent... so... no.
d_ex_court_03_37,*Bang*
d_ex_court_03_38,Yulha tosses Privaty's phone onto the table.
d_ex_court_03_39,What's the matter with you?!
d_ex_court_03_40,Sending money to an unfamiliar number without even double-checking the name...
d_ex_court_03_41,There's nothing here that actually points to the Commander being the person on the other end.
d_ex_court_03_42,All you did was give the message a quick glance before sending the money.
d_ex_court_03_43,But... they sounded like the Commander!
d_ex_court_03_44,Are you out of your mind?
d_ex_court_03_45,This is the oldest trick in the book for scammers!
d_ex_court_03_46,A... a scammer?
d_ex_court_03_47,So that wasn't the Commander...
d_ex_court_03_48,What we've got here is a classic phone scammer case.
d_ex_court_03_49,"How you ever made it to Central Government, I'll never know..."
d_ex_court_03_50,Er... so what should I do now?
d_ex_court_03_51,"First, I think you owe Newbie an apology."
d_ex_court_03_52,"What for?! It was all just a misunderstanding, it could happen to anyone!"
d_ex_court_03_53,I'll sue you for defamation!
d_ex_court_03_54,"Since we've cleared things up, let's just move on."
d_ex_court_03_55,"Gah! It's not that big a deal, is it?!"
d_ex_court_03_56,I'll let you two sort out the rest yourselves.
d_ex_court_03_57,But Yulha... What about my credit...
d_ex_court_03_58,"Oh, that's long gone. If you want, you could try filing a report with the police."
d_ex_court_03_59,"*Yawn* as for now, consider this case closed. Now get out of here, both of you."
d_ex_court_03_60,"We were both kicked out of the courthouse. As we leave, Privaty frets over how to potentially get her lost credits back."
d_ex_elevator_01_title,Elevator Ghost Story
d_ex_elevator_01_1,"It's much more spacious than I imagined.
I mean, this elevator."
d_ex_elevator_01_2,Yes. It's because it is more like a cargo elevator.
d_ex_elevator_01_3,"It looks like it's still in the testing phase.
There're only the four of us, and it's already overweight."
d_ex_elevator_01_4,Do you wanna lose some weight?
d_ex_elevator_01_5,Me?
d_ex_elevator_01_6,"Commander, are you okay?"
d_ex_elevator_01_7,I'm fine.
d_ex_elevator_01_8,"It's okay to test run, but isn't it a little dangerous? It's clearly malfunctioning now!"
d_ex_elevator_01_9,I think it's fine. The overweight indicator is just on for no reason.
d_ex_elevator_01_10,"Ahem, that's exactly how accidents happen."
d_ex_elevator_01_11,"Speaking of accidents, I remembered something."
d_ex_elevator_01_12,Do you know about the elevator accident that happened in the Ark 70 years ago?
d_ex_elevator_01_13,"Ah, that accident."
d_ex_elevator_01_14,"... Don't remind me. Every time I think of that, it makes me..."
d_ex_elevator_01_15,Makes you what?
d_ex_elevator_01_16,...
d_ex_elevator_01_17,It makes you blue?
d_ex_elevator_01_18,Not really.
d_ex_elevator_01_19,Just a little... sad.
d_ex_elevator_01_20,... Me too.
d_ex_elevator_01_21,What happened?
d_ex_elevator_01_22,Eh...
d_ex_elevator_01_23,"70 years ago, more than 200 Nikkes took the elevator and went to the surface."
d_ex_elevator_01_24,"At that time, the Ark was struggling because of the ongoing war against the Raptures. The situation got worse and worse each day."
d_ex_elevator_01_25,"Then, people of the Ark blamed the Nikkes because they couldn't defeat the Raptures in battle."
d_ex_elevator_01_26,Nikkes were treated like trash in the Ark and were given almost no rights to anything.
d_ex_elevator_01_27,"Given what was happening, a mass-produced Model ZX Nikke took the lead and rallied many Nikkes together."
d_ex_elevator_01_28,They decided to leave the Ark and go to the surface.
d_ex_elevator_01_29,They didn't do anything bad to the Ark and its people.
d_ex_elevator_01_30,Their only desire was to find a new home on the surface.
d_ex_elevator_01_31,However...
d_ex_elevator_01_32,The Central Government saw it as Nikkes defecting and forced the elevator to fall.
d_ex_elevator_01_33,"From a 4 km height, the elevator dropped and headed directly towards the Ark."
d_ex_elevator_01_34,"If the elevator hit, it would have spelled disaster to the Ark."
d_ex_elevator_01_35,...
d_ex_elevator_01_36,The 200 Nikkes in the elevator decided to self-destruct
d_ex_elevator_01_37,to protect the Ark from the deadly smash.
d_ex_elevator_01_38,The elevator just exploded in mid-air.
d_ex_elevator_01_39,The Ark only suffered minor damage.
d_ex_elevator_01_40,"... But those Nikkes, who wanted to go to the surface to run away from human oppression,"
d_ex_elevator_01_41,were sentenced to their deaths.
d_ex_elevator_01_42,"Even in their final moments, they did all they could to protect people."
d_ex_elevator_01_43,I think that is the noblest thing in the world.
d_ex_elevator_01_44,...
d_ex_elevator_01_45,"The incident was later referred to as the ""Goddess Fall""."
d_ex_elevator_01_46,Enforcement of Nikke rights in the Ark began improving after that.
d_ex_elevator_01_47,"There's still a long way to go, though."
d_ex_elevator_01_48,"Thanks to them, we can live the life we have now. We should really be grateful."
d_ex_elevator_01_49,How do you feel? About all of this?
d_ex_elevator_01_50,... I feel sad about everything.
d_ex_elevator_01_51,I feel grateful for them.
d_ex_elevator_01_52,...
d_ex_elevator_01_53,Do you know what happened after?
d_ex_elevator_01_54,What happened after?
d_ex_elevator_01_55,The elevator became a common topic in politics after being repaired.
d_ex_elevator_01_56,"After all, it symbolized the personal rights of Nikkes."
d_ex_elevator_01_57,"But according to rumors, a lot of accidents have happened after the repairs."
d_ex_elevator_01_58,It has never run normally since.
d_ex_elevator_01_59,Like... some kind of curse?
d_ex_elevator_01_60,"Hehe, who knows. Ah, on that note,"
d_ex_elevator_01_61,the model number of this elevator is...
d_ex_elevator_01_62,GQWRA-01249.
d_ex_elevator_01_63,Why do you even memorize these things?
d_ex_elevator_01_64,...
d_ex_elevator_01_65,"Anis, look there."
d_ex_elevator_01_66,...
d_ex_elevator_01_67,GQWRA-01249...
d_ex_elevator_01_68,...
d_ex_elevator_01_69,...
d_ex_elevator_01_70,...
d_ex_elevator_01_71,"N-Neon, is that you?"
d_ex_elevator_01_72,No.
d_ex_elevator_01_73,Are... are you... a... a gh... a ghost?
d_ex_elevator_01_74,Take it easy. I have confirmed your thoughts.
d_ex_elevator_01_75,As well as your Commander's thoughts.
d_ex_elevator_01_76,Don't worry.
d_ex_elevator_01_77,As long as you remember us.
d_ex_elevator_01_78,As long as you still believe that we are noble.
d_ex_elevator_01_79,As long as you still feel sad when you think about us.
d_ex_elevator_01_80,This elevator will never go wrong.
d_ex_elevator_01_81,The 200 Nikkes will protect you.
d_ex_elevator_01_82,...
d_ex_elevator_01_83,...
d_ex_elevator_01_84,The elevator stops.
d_ex_elevator_01_85,The door opens.
d_ex_elevator_01_86,Come on! Why did you turn the elevator on without me? You forgot about me!
d_ex_elevator_01_87,"... Anis, what are you doing?"
d_ex_elevator_01_88,...
d_ex_elevator_01_89,"Rapi, do you know what's wrong with her?"
d_ex_elevator_01_90,"Anis, are you okay?"
d_ex_elevator_01_91,"... Eh, I'm fine."
d_ex_elevator_01_92,Are you scared?
d_ex_elevator_01_93,No.
d_ex_elevator_01_94,"I'm just feeling thankful,"
d_ex_elevator_01_95,that we have somewhere to go after we die.
d_ex_elevator_02_title,Door of Superstition
d_ex_elevator_02_1,In front of the elevator leading to the surface.
d_ex_elevator_02_2,...
d_ex_elevator_02_3,...
d_ex_elevator_02_4,What are you doing?
d_ex_elevator_02_5,Don't talk to me. I'm in the middle of a guild raid.
d_ex_elevator_02_6,Me too.
d_ex_elevator_02_7,Zing-
d_ex_elevator_02_8,The elevator arrives.
d_ex_elevator_02_9,"All right, let's get on."
d_ex_elevator_02_10,...Soon after.
d_ex_elevator_02_11,"Argh, the connection!"
d_ex_elevator_02_12,I was just about to use a skill!
d_ex_elevator_02_13,"Hey, why isn't Psycontrol working?"
d_ex_elevator_02_14,"Cause it's buffering, duh!"
d_ex_elevator_02_15,"Oh, really?"
d_ex_elevator_02_16,Are you two participating in the same raid?
d_ex_elevator_02_17,Are you two in the same guild?
d_ex_elevator_02_18,...
d_ex_elevator_02_19,"Guess so! Actually, I didn't realize it until just now."
d_ex_elevator_02_20,What a coincidence!
d_ex_elevator_02_21,"That's not important right now, Black Rose!"
d_ex_elevator_02_22,"If this keeps up much longer,"
d_ex_elevator_02_23,our guild leaderboard is going to plummet.
d_ex_elevator_02_24,We'll lose our chance at the top spot this season.
d_ex_elevator_02_25,We can't let that happen!
d_ex_elevator_02_26,We have to get a connection somehow.
d_ex_elevator_02_27,Put your phones closer to the floor.
d_ex_elevator_02_28,Raise your phones high up in the air.
d_ex_elevator_02_29,!!
d_ex_elevator_02_30,"It may look stupid, but let's give it a shot."
d_ex_elevator_02_31,The two of them crouch down and place their phones on the ground.
d_ex_elevator_02_32,!!
d_ex_elevator_02_33,"It may look stupid, but let's give it a shot."
d_ex_elevator_02_34,The two of them stand on their tip-toes and raise their phones up in the air.
d_ex_elevator_02_35,...
d_ex_elevator_02_36,"Agh, it's still not connecting!"
d_ex_elevator_02_37,The door! Let's get near the door!
d_ex_elevator_02_38,What kind of logic is that? There's no way that will work.
d_ex_elevator_02_39,"Who cares about logic right now! We had that boss on the ropes, but now we might end up getting beaten by it!"
d_ex_elevator_02_40,!!
d_ex_elevator_02_41,They both put their phones right up against the door.
d_ex_elevator_02_42,...
d_ex_elevator_02_43,C-connected!
d_ex_elevator_02_44,Same here!
d_ex_elevator_02_45,"Oh no, all the other guild members are dead!"
d_ex_elevator_02_46,10 seconds left until recovery!
d_ex_elevator_02_47,Going to the wide feather-
d_ex_elevator_02_48,Standing close to the door gives you a better connection?
d_ex_elevator_02_49,Yes.
d_ex_elevator_02_50,But we've reaaaally gotta get up against it
d_ex_elevator_02_51,otherwise we won't get any signal at all.
d_ex_elevator_02_52,A little closer...
d_ex_elevator_02_53,It's dangerous to be that close. Back up a little.
d_ex_elevator_02_54,It's a risk we're willing to take.
d_ex_elevator_02_55,Psycontrol! My skill cool down is done!
d_ex_elevator_02_56,Drag me to the Ug-
d_ex_elevator_02_57,Ye-yes! Coming!
d_ex_elevator_02_58,Zing-
d_ex_elevator_02_59,Yelp!
d_ex_elevator_02_60,Noooo!
d_ex_elevator_02_61,...
d_ex_elevator_02_62,...
d_ex_elevator_02_63,"Master, what are they doing?"
d_ex_elevator_02_64,Why are they so close to the door?
d_ex_elevator_02_65,They're trying to get a connection.
d_ex_elevator_02_66,They were in the midst of a great showdown.
d_ex_elevator_02_67,What is that?
d_ex_elevator_02_68,You can get a connection if you stand by the door?
d_ex_elevator_02_69,Seems so.
d_ex_elevator_02_70,A showdown?
d_ex_elevator_02_71,Do they have something against the elevator door?
d_ex_elevator_02_72,"Quite the opposite, it was their savior."
d_ex_elevator_02_73,No...
d_ex_elevator_02_74,We lost.
d_ex_elevator_02_75,"I can't believe it... No, I won't..."
d_ex_elevator_02_76,To be fair...
d_ex_elevator_02_77,do you really think the elevator is a good place to be gaming?
d_ex_elevator_02_78,Sure!
d_ex_elevator_02_79,Why not?
d_ex_elevator_02_80,"On that note, Psycontrol."
d_ex_elevator_02_81,"Next time, we've got to get right up against the elevator door from the get go."
d_ex_elevator_02_82,That way we'll be sure not to lose our connection.
d_ex_elevator_02_83,Roger that!
d_ex_elevator_02_84,"And Commander, be sure to tell us when the elevator doors are about to open."
d_ex_elevator_02_85,...Okay.
d_ex_elevator_02_86,...Soon after.
d_ex_elevator_02_87,"Returning from the mission, the two of them both participated in another raid on the elevator ride down."
d_ex_elevator_02_88,"This time however, there was no connection to be found, not even by the door. They suffered an ignominious defeat."
d_ex_elevator_03_title,Breakdown!
d_ex_elevator_03_1,Something isn't right about this mission.
d_ex_elevator_03_2,Why would they have us demolish an abandoned mine? What for?
d_ex_elevator_03_3,Isn't it obvious?
d_ex_elevator_03_4,They don't want to leave any resources for the Raptures.
d_ex_elevator_03_5,I still don't get it.
d_ex_elevator_03_6,There have been Nikkes working at this mining site for decades. Why would they turn to non-professionals like us to get the job done?
d_ex_elevator_03_7,Weren't the workers all evacuated?
d_ex_elevator_03_8,They must know something that we don't.
d_ex_elevator_03_9,I see you haven't been informed. The miners are all still there.
d_ex_elevator_03_10,"If I were you, I wouldn't ask any more questions about the Big O, or you may end up six feet under."
d_ex_elevator_03_11,"That being said,"
d_ex_elevator_03_12,the Nikkes working there have been doing so for decades now.
d_ex_elevator_03_13,"They're all older, obsolete models, so renovating and re-using them wouldn't make any sense."
d_ex_elevator_03_14,"I'm sure you understand what I'm getting at, Shining Head Novel."
d_ex_elevator_03_15,...
d_ex_elevator_03_16,I'd really appreciate it if you came up with another nickname...
d_ex_elevator_03_17,*Buzz* *Thud*
d_ex_elevator_03_18,?!
d_ex_elevator_03_19,The elevator stopped!
d_ex_elevator_03_20,What?
d_ex_elevator_03_21,Don't panic!
d_ex_elevator_03_22,I'll get in touch with Exia and ask for assistance.
d_ex_elevator_03_23,They'll be able to reboot the computer in no time.
d_ex_elevator_03_24,No.
d_ex_elevator_03_25,"I realize you may have an aversion to it,"
d_ex_elevator_03_26,but think for a second.
d_ex_elevator_03_27,Huh? What are you ta...
d_ex_elevator_03_28,...
d_ex_elevator_03_29,The two Nikkes exchange glances.
d_ex_elevator_03_30,Yeah...now that you mention it...
d_ex_elevator_03_31,I did feel something wasn't right.
d_ex_elevator_03_32,What is that?
d_ex_elevator_03_33,"Listen up, Watson."
d_ex_elevator_03_34,"According to my deductions,"
d_ex_elevator_03_35,what we've got here is not just a simple elevator malfunction.
d_ex_elevator_03_36,"First off, we must consider the passengers in said elevator."
d_ex_elevator_03_37,"That would be Watson, Guillotine, and myself."
d_ex_elevator_03_38,This is by no means an ordinary grouping of individuals that you would see every day.
d_ex_elevator_03_39,Damn straight!
d_ex_elevator_03_40,I'm the most mysterious Nikke in the entire Ark.
d_ex_elevator_03_41,And you're the most inquisitive.
d_ex_elevator_03_42,"Put the three of us together, and it's tossing chum in shark-infested waters."
d_ex_elevator_03_43,...
d_ex_elevator_03_44,"That's right. The moment all three of us got together, a perfectly functioning elevator suddenly bit the dust."
d_ex_elevator_03_45,"Don't you find that suspicious, Watson?"
d_ex_elevator_03_46,I also know for a fact that Liter checked this elevator not too long ago.
d_ex_elevator_03_47,But the maintenance report says the last inspection was 10 years ago.
d_ex_elevator_03_48,Then there's no way this elevator would break down so easily.
d_ex_elevator_03_49,... Liter is the owner of the Hand of Hephaestus.
d_ex_elevator_03_50,"Anything she fixes will never break down again, no matter how much time passes."
d_ex_elevator_03_51,Exactly. No machinery that Mighty Tools helped to repair would break down like this.
d_ex_elevator_03_52,Not unless it had been deliberately sabotaged by someone.
d_ex_elevator_03_53,Not only that... um...
d_ex_elevator_03_54,"Don't worry, I'll take it from here."
d_ex_elevator_03_55,"Can you feel it, Partner? It started not long ago."
d_ex_elevator_03_56,"This place is rife with the fetid stench of the ""Origin""."
d_ex_elevator_03_57,"Fundamentally speaking, an elevator shaft is a space where things repeatedly ascend and descend."
d_ex_elevator_03_58,So some bad mojo may be at play here.
d_ex_elevator_03_59,... What are you on about?
d_ex_elevator_03_60,I see.
d_ex_elevator_03_61,... The flow of air is obstructed inside the elevator shaft...
d_ex_elevator_03_62,"Plus, the huge vertical drop has caused a change in the atmospheric pressure,"
d_ex_elevator_03_63,which would make this a prime place to set up a trap of some kind... I think?
d_ex_elevator_03_64,"You're pretty quick on your feet, Shining Head."
d_ex_elevator_03_65,That's right.
d_ex_elevator_03_66,"Partner, you're a fairly intelligent individual."
d_ex_elevator_03_67,"It may have taken us a while to get there, but in short,"
d_ex_elevator_03_68,all the evidence points to one conclusion.
d_ex_elevator_03_69,And that is...
d_ex_elevator_03_70,A well-planned booby trapped designed to kill us!
d_ex_elevator_03_71,... It's one of The Big O's conspiracies to make the demon lord go ballistic!
d_ex_elevator_03_72,...
d_ex_elevator_03_73,...
d_ex_elevator_03_74,...
d_ex_elevator_03_75,So what do you want to do?
d_ex_elevator_03_76,Can you two reach a consensus first?
d_ex_elevator_03_77,"Isn't it obvious, Watson?"
d_ex_elevator_03_78,We must head back to the Ark and apprehend the suspect behind this failed assassination attempt.
d_ex_elevator_03_79,"Pssh, that doesn't matter. The most important thing is that..."
d_ex_elevator_03_80,... we need to head back to the Ark and apprehend the suspect behind this failed assassination attempt.
d_ex_elevator_03_81,Precisely. This person intends to use us as a blood sacrifice to aggravate the demon lord.
d_ex_elevator_03_82,We mustn't allow such a dastardly fiend to go unpunished.
d_ex_elevator_03_83,We must return to the Ark at once.
d_ex_elevator_03_84,What about the mission?
d_ex_elevator_03_85,"I agree, let's head back."
d_ex_elevator_03_86,We'll just have to postpone it for a week or two.
d_ex_elevator_03_87,"Yes, and as for the mission, we'll just have to postpone it for a week or two."
d_ex_elevator_03_88,A month would be even better.
d_ex_elevator_03_89,...
d_ex_elevator_03_90,"Actually, make that as long as possible. As long as it takes to get from here back to the Ark by foot. Yeah, that'd be the best."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_title,The Crying Angel
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_1,Majestic-looking Goddess of Victory statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_2,Someone falls down in front of it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_3,Looks like someone homeless.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_4,Mind my own business.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_5,Go check if she's still alive.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_6,Suddenly...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_7,The homeless person grabs hold of my pants!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_8,*Pat pat*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_9,No response. She may be dead.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_10,Move on.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_11,Please... wait...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_12,I need... some food...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_13,Anything... that provides energy... is fine...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_14,Snow White?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_15,... Later.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_16,Huh... I'm alive.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_17,"My body is a machine, but my brain is still human."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_18,It needs a lot of energy to run.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_19,That's why I sometimes get groggy.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_20,This time I was lucky. My instincts led me to you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_21,I can't call it a thank-you gift...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_22,but I want to tell you an interesting story about this bronze statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_23,"Soon, Snow White and I stand in front of the statue."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_24,"You know what, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_25,"Since I fainted last night, this statue has moved about 5cm from where it was."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_26,You're scaring me.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_27,That's not possible.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_28,I didn't want to believe it at first.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_29,But my eyes don't lie.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_30,The statue's waist was straight.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_31,"Now, it tilts a little towards where I was lying."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_32,It's as if it was staring at me while I was lying on the ground...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_33,Sounds like an interesting ghost story.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_34,Unbelievable.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_35,Do you like ghost stories?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_36,How about experiencing one yourself tonight?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_37,You don't believe me?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_38,How about we come back tonight and check it again?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_39,Just remember how the statue looks right now.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_40,Let's come back tomorrow to see if we can notice any changes.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_41,"... That night, in front of the statue."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_42,"Well, let's pretend to be dead, shall we?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_43,Why is that necessary?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_44,It looks like you are unfamiliar with ghost stories.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_45,"As far as I know, most artifacts in those stories"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_46,only move when they are not being observed.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_47,Haven't you ever heard of paintings changing their expressions
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_48,or moving their eyes when no one else is looking at them?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_49,Yes I have.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_50,"No, never."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_51,Then you understand.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_52,Then time to experience it for the first time.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_53,Let me show you how it's done.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_54,Snow White shuffles towards the statue
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_55,and collapses in front of it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_56,Touch Snow White.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_57,Lay down in the same position.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_58,*Pat pat*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_59,No response. Just like a dead body.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_60,Lay beside Snow White.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_61,"...
..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_62,Laying on the ground quietly.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_63,Chaotic thoughts crowd my mind.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_64,"Many buildings in the Outpost have their own ghost stories,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_65,but I have never heard anything about this Goddess of Victory statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_66,Why did it start moving last night?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_67,Snow White's soul must have gone inside the statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_68,Snow White awakened the soul inside the statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_69,... I look at Snow White who is lying on the ground like a dead body.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_70,This makes sense.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_71,But the other explanation may also be true.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_72,Snow White awakened the soul inside the statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_73,... Suddenly I realized.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_74,The Goddess of Victory statue was built to commemorate Nikkes who lost their lives in battle.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_75,Maybe it has the souls of those Nikkes' in it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_76,"Maybe it was because they wanted to check on Snow White who appeared to be dead,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_77,that they lowered their heads for the first time last night...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_78,*Drip*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_79,*Drip drip*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_80,Some sort of droplet falls on my face and rolls down my cheek.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_81,Blood?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_82,Tears?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_83,I open my eyes slowly.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_84,The statue is making a 90-degree bow
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_85,and spreading its arms towards Snow White.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_86,Tears of blood are falling from its eyes. It looks like it wants to bring Snow White to heaven.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_87,Wake up Snow White.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_88,Er... I fell asleep.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_89,Did anything happen?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_90,The statue!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_91,The statue?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_92,"Oh, it moved?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_93,... I see.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_94,It's 5cm lower than yesterday for sure.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_95,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_96,How's that? Do you believe me now?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_01_97,"... Yeah, I guess."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_title,Milestone of Memory
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_1,In front of the Goddess of Victory statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_2,N102 is on her knees with her eyes closed and her hands clasped together.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_3,"Hello, Sister."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_4,What are you praying about?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_5,...?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_6,Who are you...?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_7,Are you a nun?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_8,"Indeed I am. Please, call me Rapunzel."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_9,So you're Sister Rapunzel! I'm N102.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_10,I was praying that it would rain tomorrow.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_11,You must enjoy the rain very much.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_12,"Oh yeah, a whole lot!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_13,There is nothing more calming than the sound of gently falling raindrops.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_14,"Are you here to pray as well, Believer?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_15,I'm just here with N102.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_16,"I see, how have you been doing?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_17,How lovely running into you like this.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_18,You two know each other?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_19,"I'm going to pray a little longer,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_20,you two can catch up.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_21,Okay.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_22,N102 continues to pray.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_23,Rapunzel and I move away from N102.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_24,Sister N102 has been coming here to pray for the past couple of days.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_25,You noticed?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_26,Of course. She and I often have wonderful discussions.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_27,Yesterday she prayed for sunny weather because she doesn't like rain...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_28,"Today, she comes to pray for the opposite."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_29,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_30,"So, do you know about..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_31,Yes. I have introduced myself to her many times over.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_32,How lonely it must be to wake up each morning having to face an unfamiliar world...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_33,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_34,Why does Sister N102 come here to pray every day?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_35,There must be something written in her notebook telling her so.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_36,"Ah, so that notebook she always brings with her"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_37,"could be considered her ""memory""."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_38,Have you thought about writing your name in her notebook?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_39,"I have entertained the notion, but I do not feel it is wise to do so."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_40,My existence must be kept a secret from the outside world.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_41,"After conversing for a while, N102 finished praying and came towards us."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_42,You two seem really wrapped up in conversation!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_43,"Sister N102, have you finished praying?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_44,"Yes, all finished."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_45,"If it does not offend you,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_46,could I see the notebook you carry around with you?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_47,Sorry? No-notebook?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_48,Um... sure. Here.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_49,Rapunzel takes the notebook from N102.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_50,"Now that you are finished praying, I assume you'll purchase some juice?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_51,"Yep! Once I get my juice, I'm all done for the day."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_52,"Tell me,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_53,do you think it will rain tomorrow like you wished for?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_54,Hm... I'm not too sure.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_55,So I prayed for one more thing!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_56,"If it doesn't rain tomorrow, I prayed that you, Teacher, and I could all go on a picnic together!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_57,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_58,I thought you like rainy days?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_59,"Sure, but my prayers may not be heard, and it might not rain."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_60,If the weather is sunny tomorrow then I want to go on a picnic with you two!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_61,"That way, I'll be happy whether it rains or not!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_62,"Rapunzel smiles weakly at N102's comment, a bittersweet look on her face."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_63,So this is how it feels to be erased from someone's memory.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_64,I wonder... how many people have I forgotten?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_65,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_66,I should pray to the statue as well.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_67,"Rapunzel kneels in front of the Goddess of Victory statue, filled with reverence."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_68,It's quite the sight seeing Sister Rapunzel pray.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_69,What do you think she'll pray for?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_70,That the weather is sunny tomorrow.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_71,That she can remember this moment.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_72,Does she not like the rain?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_73,I like the rain.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_74,But it'd be nicer if we can all go on a picnic together.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_75,Really? I should pray for the same thing then.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_76,It was great that all three of us were able to spend time together today!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_77,"I've got to get going, gotta buy some juice..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_78,Let's go together after you finish praying.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_79,"Okay, sounds good!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_80,N102 kneels beside Rapunzel.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_81,Believer...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_82,Will you pray as well?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_83,We all knelt down and prayed for some time.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_84,"Tomorrow, the weather will be sunny."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_02_85,"Tomorrow, the day after, and a year from now, the Goddess of Victory statue will remember all the Nikkes who knelt before it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_title,Between Sense and Sentimentality
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_1,What lovely weather we're having!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_2,This is a perfect day to clean up the statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_3,"I thought we were coming just to visit the statue, not clean it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_4,"That was the plan at first, but"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_5,I was told there were some strange marks and liquid stains on it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_6,So I wanted to clean it up a bit.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_7,Pepper stands in front of the statue with some cleaning tools in her hands.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_8,This statue was made to commemorate all the fallen Nikkes who have sacrificed their lives in the fight to reclaim the surface.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_9,I hate to see a statue with so much meaning
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_10,be in such a state.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_11,So I took it upon myself to wash it up.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_12,"Sorry for roping you in on your day off, Commander."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_13,"It's okay, no worries."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_14,No. 7? What are you doing here?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_15,!!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_16,Ether?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_17,You're the one from M.M.R...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_18,What are all these cleaning tools... Are you planning on tidying up this place?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_19,What for?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_20,"What brings you here, Ether?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_21,I have some personal matters to attend to.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_22,Personal matters?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_23,"Ah yes, I almost forgot to ask you."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_24,What is that?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_25,Have you seen any suspicious Nikkes around here?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_26,When you say suspicious Nikkes...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_27,I'm referring to the Pilgrims.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_28,Pilgrims?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_29,Have you seen them?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_30,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_31,No.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_32,Hmm? Why aren't you saying anything?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_33,No? Are you sure?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_34,Why do you ask?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_35,No reason.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_36,It's just that there are rumors of a Pilgrim being in the vicinity of this statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_37,I thought that perhaps you might know something about it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_38,"But since you claim not to have seen anyone,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_39,I can continue going about my business.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_40,And what is that?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_41,Ta-da.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_42,Ether takes out a transparent bottle and a brush from her pockets.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_43,Are those...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_44,?!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_45,This will help me to capture that Pilgrim.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_46,Ether uses her brush to apply some transparent liquid to the statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_47,What are you doing?!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_48,*Squeak*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_49,"Done. If anyone touches this statue today, they'll leave their fingerprints behind."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_50,"Then, all I have to do is compare those fingerprints with those of the Nikkes inside the Ark. If I fail to produce a match, then it must be a Pilgrim."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_51,So you're the one who's been desecrating this statue!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_52,What on earth are you talking about?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_53,The handprints and liquid stains! It was you!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_54,Oh... that.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_55,And what if I did?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_56,"This is a sacred statue, and you're defiling it!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_57,"How can you stand there and act like nothing is wrong, after committing such a heinous act?!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_58,"Calm down already, don't have a conniption."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_59,You're acting like I poured this stuff over your own head.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_60,This statue was built in memory of all those fallen Nikkes!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_61,I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you. I say the humans who constructed this statue also constructed that story.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_62,All that nonsense about commemorating fallen Nikkes was just to make it seem special and get more Nikkes to come see this hunk of rock.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_63,"Even if that were the case,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_64,defacing statues isn't right!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_65,You act as if I'm doing this for no reason.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_66,Did you not hear what I just said?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_67,I'm hoping this will lead me to the Pilgrim!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_68,Then what was that squeaking sound just now? Whatever you're using is eating away at the statue!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_69,And?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_70,"If that isn't careless, then what is?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_71,"This is absurd! You're a Nikke yourself, how could you..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_72,You're the one being ridiculous! Why can't you understand that searching for clues regarding that Pilgrim
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_73,is more important than honoring a few dead Nikkes?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_74,"I can see that you're from Seraphim, so you must be a doctor, yes? How can you be so harebrained?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_75,Has your entire mind been taken over by sentimentality?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_76,"This is about morality, not sentimentality."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_77,Argh! You're so irritating!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_78,"Fine, I'll stop. Happy now?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_79,"For all I know, this may be a Seraphim conspiracy. What do I care?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_80,"I quit, so save your breath."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_81,"Typical doctor, always prattling on..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_82,Hey!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_83,"See you around, No.7."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_84,Don't forget to tell me if you see anyone from Seraphim.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_85,Ether leaves.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_86,Some people just can't be reasoned with!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_87,Calm down.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_88,!!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_89,Just look at this mess she made! She left without even cleaning it up.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_90,... Let's roll up our sleeves and get to it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_91,"The next time I see her, I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_03_92,...
d_ex_gym_01_title,Hardbody Project
d_ex_gym_01_1,Hello~! My lovely Lupins☆
d_ex_gym_01_2,"Welcome back to my channel, where I show you all the world of Shopaholics Anonymous!"
d_ex_gym_01_3,"Sorry to all those who were expecting today's stream to be about shopping, but I've got something very special prepared for everyone."
d_ex_gym_01_4,"But what, exactly? It's..."
d_ex_gym_01_5,"Super special exercise edition! Get the laziest Nikke in Tetra, and make it the best body possible!"
d_ex_gym_01_6,"What's more, we've got the Ark's first very own personal trainer joining us today! Say hi to Rumani!"
d_ex_gym_01_7,Anything you'd like to promote? Perhaps the newly opened gym?
d_ex_gym_01_8,"Hi, I'm here to gather members who aren't afraid to pump some iron."
d_ex_gym_01_9,It's a pleasure to be here.
d_ex_gym_01_10,"So, who is the lazy Nikke I'll be helping today?"
d_ex_gym_01_11,"Hmmm, let's see..."
d_ex_gym_01_12,Perhaps we should hold a vote.
d_ex_gym_01_13,"All right Lupins, make your voices heard!"
d_ex_gym_01_14,Who is the laziest Nikke from Tetra Line?
m_ex_gym_01_1,Exia
m_ex_gym_01_2,Exia for sure.
m_ex_gym_01_3,"Yep, Exia all the way."
m_ex_gym_01_4,Exia! Exia! Exia!
m_ex_gym_01_5,Eeeexxxxxiiiiiaaaa
m_ex_gym_01_6,Exia
m_ex_gym_01_7,Was there ever any doubt? Exia.
d_ex_gym_01_15,"Well, it seems to be unanimous."
d_ex_gym_01_16,I expected you would all vote for her.
d_ex_gym_01_17,"So I have brought her here! Please welcome our special guest, who slept in until 5pm today!"
d_ex_gym_01_18,Ugh... I despise the gym.
d_ex_gym_01_19,I hate it more than the dentist. I want to go home.
d_ex_gym_01_20,Seems our guest is a bit lethargic... what should we do?
d_ex_gym_01_21,That's it! Let's put a prize into the mix.
d_ex_gym_01_22,"If Exia puts in enough time at the gym,"
d_ex_gym_01_23,"she'll be going home with the latest gaming console, the Tetra Station Final Quest Edition. It's been flying off the shelves lately, so it's tough to find!"
d_ex_gym_01_24,All righty then... I'll do what I can.
d_ex_gym_01_25,"Excellent! Now that our participant has some pep in her step, let's st... No, before that,"
d_ex_gym_01_26,let's go to commercial.
d_ex_gym_01_27,"Amino 606, the perfect pre and post-workout protein supplement."
d_ex_gym_01_28,Try it today! You won't be disappointed!
d_ex_gym_01_29,A while later.
d_ex_gym_01_30,"Since it's the first day, let's go easy."
d_ex_gym_01_31,"First we'll stretch, followed by 20 pushups, 20 squats, and 20 burpees..."
d_ex_gym_01_32,5 sets.
d_ex_gym_01_33,That'll make a nice even 100. All good?
d_ex_gym_01_34,Are you kidding? That's way too much.
d_ex_gym_01_35,This place will be the end of me!
d_ex_gym_01_36,Our guest is throwing in the towel already! We can't have that.
d_ex_gym_01_37,"Of course, I came prepared in case this happened."
d_ex_gym_01_38,"So, I've brought our second guest."
d_ex_gym_01_39,Hello. Commander here.
d_ex_gym_01_40,Very nice! Any words of encouragement for our Nikke friend here?
d_ex_gym_01_41,"Come on, up and at 'em! Do you want that console or not?"
d_ex_gym_01_42,"The more in shape you are, the longer you'll be able to play games."
d_ex_gym_01_43,!!
d_ex_gym_01_44,If you put it that way...
d_ex_gym_01_45,!!
d_ex_gym_01_46,That...
d_ex_gym_01_47,doesn't sound too bad.
d_ex_gym_01_48,...
d_ex_gym_01_49,You've got a real look of determination now!
d_ex_gym_01_50,"In that case, allow me to demonstrate the exercises. First up are pushups."
d_ex_gym_01_51,Rumani gets down on the ground and straightens out her body.
d_ex_gym_01_52,"One, two. One, two."
d_ex_gym_01_53,Your arms should be at a 90 degree angle.
d_ex_gym_01_54,Your hips shouldn't be any higher or lower than this.
d_ex_gym_01_55,"Exia lies flat on the ground,"
d_ex_gym_01_56,"straightens out her body, and..."
d_ex_gym_01_57,*Falls down*
d_ex_gym_01_58,...
d_ex_gym_01_59,It's okay. That happens to everyone the first time around.
d_ex_gym_01_60,"Let's do it again. This time, clench your stomach."
d_ex_gym_01_61,"One, two..."
d_ex_gym_01_62,*Falls down*
d_ex_gym_01_63,Hmm. Let's try with your knees on the ground.
d_ex_gym_01_64,*Falls down*
d_ex_gym_01_65,How about we just try to hold ourselves up? No moving up or down.
d_ex_gym_01_66,*Falls down*
d_ex_gym_01_67,...
d_ex_gym_01_68,...
d_ex_gym_01_69,*Sniffle*
d_ex_gym_01_70,Exia runs away.
d_ex_gym_01_71,... Should I go get her?
d_ex_gym_01_72,She... er...
d_ex_gym_01_73,has a long way to go.
d_ex_gym_01_74,Indeed.
d_ex_gym_01_75,"However, this is a one month program."
d_ex_gym_01_76,I'll head to her room tomorrow and give her some exercise equipment.
d_ex_gym_01_77,!!
d_ex_gym_02_title,Suspicious Girl
d_ex_gym_02_1,"Coach, is that you?"
d_ex_gym_02_2,Epinel and Folkwang are huddled together. They stare off intently into the distance.
d_ex_gym_02_3,What are you two doing?
d_ex_gym_02_4,"Oh...um, we're just..."
d_ex_gym_02_5,We're tracking a suspicious individual.
d_ex_gym_02_6,Who?
d_ex_gym_02_7,"Over there. She came to the gym, but hasn't worked out at all. She just keeps starting at us..."
d_ex_gym_02_8,I look at where they are pointing.
d_ex_gym_02_9,...
d_ex_gym_02_10,Ether?!
d_ex_gym_02_11,"Hey, you. The Nikke with the long hair."
d_ex_gym_02_12,Huh? Me?
d_ex_gym_02_13,"Yes, you. Why are you sweating so much?"
d_ex_gym_02_14,Is it that hot in here?
d_ex_gym_02_15,"Oh, um...I guess it is a little hot, for me at least!"
d_ex_gym_02_16,"I don't tolerate the heat very well so even a little movement gets me going. Oh boy, I really am sweating..."
d_ex_gym_02_17,So you're the Nikke who's always sweating.
d_ex_gym_02_18,"I've heard about you, but it's fascinating seeing it live and up close."
d_ex_gym_02_19,"So you just move a little bit and then the waterworks start up, huh?"
d_ex_gym_02_20,Which company are you from?
d_ex_gym_02_21,Uh... Tetra Line.
d_ex_gym_02_22,"Too bad. If you were from our company,"
d_ex_gym_02_23,I'd have gotten permission from Syuen to tinker around with you a bit.
d_ex_gym_02_24,!!
d_ex_gym_02_25,"T-tinker with me? Oh no, the sweating is getting worse..."
d_ex_gym_02_26,What are you doing?
d_ex_gym_02_27,What do you mean?
d_ex_gym_02_28,"I'm here to work out, why else would I come to a public gym?"
d_ex_gym_02_29,Then I suggest you start burning muscle and stop giving others the eyeball.
d_ex_gym_02_30,"Oh, that? I'm sorry."
d_ex_gym_02_31,Consider it an occupational hazard.
d_ex_gym_02_32,It's my job to observe others and develop drugs tailored specifically to them.
d_ex_gym_02_33,Drugs?
d_ex_gym_02_34,You develop drugs?
d_ex_gym_02_35,"Yeah, you interested?"
d_ex_gym_02_36,Absolutely!
d_ex_gym_02_37,Could you by any chance develop a drug that prevents someone from sweating?
d_ex_gym_02_38,Of course! You can make anything under the proper research environment.
d_ex_gym_02_39,How would you go about developing a drug like that?
d_ex_gym_02_40,"First, I'd gather people"
d_ex_gym_02_41,who say they have an incurable disease.
d_ex_gym_02_42,"Then I'd give them some medication, a few injections, and see what happens. Why?"
d_ex_gym_02_43,Are you interested?
d_ex_gym_02_44,"Wow, treating an incurable disease! That's wonderful!"
d_ex_gym_02_45,Medication... and injections?
d_ex_gym_02_46,"So in other words, test subjects."
d_ex_gym_02_47,"Precisely! Isn't that right, No. 7?"
d_ex_gym_02_48,...
d_ex_gym_02_49,!!
d_ex_gym_02_50,No. 7? Did you just call the Coach No.7?
d_ex_gym_02_51,Of course.
d_ex_gym_02_52,No.7 is my special test subject.
d_ex_gym_02_53,They're one of my most precious test subjects. I hope one day that they'll grace my operating table.
d_ex_gym_02_54,"So... if I don't let you take Folkwang, you'll use the Commander as a test subject?"
d_ex_gym_02_55,Most likely.
d_ex_gym_02_56,... I knew it.
d_ex_gym_02_57,It really is a shame no one has examined you properly. Would you like me to contact Tetra and ask if I can take you on as a test subject?
d_ex_gym_02_58,!!
d_ex_gym_02_59,Me? A test subject?
d_ex_gym_02_60,Precisely.
d_ex_gym_02_61,Er... well... that doesn't really work for me...
d_ex_gym_02_62,"If you're not going to work out, I'll have to ask you to leave."
d_ex_gym_02_63,"This is a gym, not a recruitment area for new test subjects."
d_ex_gym_02_64,"I'm not going anywhere. This is a public facility, and I have as much right to be here as you do."
d_ex_gym_02_65,"Fine, if you're gonna play it that way,"
d_ex_gym_02_66,then we're leaving.
d_ex_gym_02_67,Epinel takes out her board.
d_ex_gym_02_68,Let's go Folkwang.
d_ex_gym_02_69,"Since she doesn't want to leave, I suppose we will."
d_ex_gym_02_70,Right now?
d_ex_gym_02_71,"Um... I'm sorry, but someone needs my help."
d_ex_gym_02_72,I'll see you later.
d_ex_gym_02_73,Epinel pulls at Folkwang's arm.
d_ex_gym_02_74,Hey! Do you really want to leave that badly?
d_ex_gym_02_75,Yes.
d_ex_gym_02_76,Stop pulling! My arm is gonna pop out! Owwww!
d_ex_gym_02_77,"Epinel rides off on her board, dragging Folkwang alongside her."
d_ex_gym_02_78,"Hehe, seems they escaped."
d_ex_gym_02_79,Too bad. It was fun teasing them.
d_ex_gym_02_80,You may have taken it a bit too far.
d_ex_gym_02_81,They're the ones who treated me like a mad scientist and got scared.
d_ex_gym_02_82,I just had some fun playing up the part.
d_ex_gym_02_83,And I wasn't entirely joking.
d_ex_gym_02_84,You weren't?
d_ex_gym_02_85,I was very serious about wanting her as a test subject.
d_ex_gym_02_86,!!
d_ex_gym_02_87,"She's a very unique case, which peaks my interest."
d_ex_gym_02_88,And I let her slip through my fingers... What a shame.
d_ex_gym_02_89,...
d_ex_gym_03_title,Lose. Good. Fight.
d_ex_gym_03_1,"Pssh, there's no way you can win here."
d_ex_gym_03_2,Have you forgotten?
d_ex_gym_03_3,"I may not look like much, but no one, and nothing, can penetrate my defenses. Nothing gets past me!"
d_ex_gym_03_4,Hardy har har.
d_ex_gym_03_5,"I don't know how it happened, but Noah and I are having a sports showdown in the gym, and I'm getting my butt handed to me on the badminton court."
d_ex_gym_03_6,"So tell me, how does it feel to lose?"
d_ex_gym_03_7,I want a rematch tomorrow.
d_ex_gym_03_8,"Oh, you want to go another round? I'm never one to turn down a challenge. Besides, I'm looking forward to wiping the floor with you again tomorrow!"
d_ex_gym_03_9,"If you're afraid it'll be too difficult, I'll show some mercy and let you bring a teammate along with you, hee hee!"
d_ex_gym_03_10,...
d_ex_gym_03_11,The next day.
d_ex_gym_03_12,"Wow, what a giant gymnasium!"
d_ex_gym_03_13,"This is my first time playing badminton, I'm so excited!"
d_ex_gym_03_14,Me too.
d_ex_gym_03_15,I appreciate your enthusiasm. I can't believe you actually brought a teammate with you.
d_ex_gym_03_16,Worried you won't be able to defeat me solo? Hehe...
d_ex_gym_03_17,Hello there! My name is Ann!
d_ex_gym_03_18,You don't look like you'll pose much of a threat either.
d_ex_gym_03_19,You two don't stand a chance. You're both gonna be so embarrassed when you lose two against one!
d_ex_gym_03_20,Don't get too cocky.
d_ex_gym_03_21,"Wowzers, you look really strong!"
d_ex_gym_03_22,"You think so? You've got a keen eye, I'll say that much."
d_ex_gym_03_23,Ready when you are.
d_ex_gym_03_24,"Ann, all you've got to do is hit and keep hitting the shuttlecock over to the other side."
d_ex_gym_03_25,"Okay, got it!"
d_ex_gym_03_26,"All right, let's begin."
d_ex_gym_03_27,"Oh man, this is going to be fun."
d_ex_gym_03_28,"All right, I'll serve first. After all, it is two versus one."
d_ex_gym_03_29,Fine by me.
d_ex_gym_03_30,"I'm just sad that this will be over so quickly. Ready or not, here it comes!"
d_ex_gym_03_31,"Just as she finishes speaking, Noah lobs a serve. The ball flies to our side at seemingly supersonic speed."
d_ex_gym_03_32,Ann!
d_ex_gym_03_33,On it!
d_ex_gym_03_34,*Pow*
d_ex_gym_03_35,"You managed to return that? This might not be so boring after all, hee hee!"
d_ex_gym_03_36,*Pow pow pow pow*
d_ex_gym_03_37,The two Nikkes hit the shuttlecock back and forth.
d_ex_gym_03_38,5 minutes later.
d_ex_gym_03_39,Hey! How come you're not trying to swing?
d_ex_gym_03_40,I haven't had a chance to...
d_ex_gym_03_41,"Argh! If you're just going to stand there and get in the way, then scram!"
d_ex_gym_03_42,I step off the court.
d_ex_gym_03_43,*Pow pow pow pow*
d_ex_gym_03_44,You're pretty good!
d_ex_gym_03_45,Really? Do you think so?
d_ex_gym_03_46,"Nothing to write home about, but at least you're a worthy opponent."
d_ex_gym_03_47,*Pow pow pow pow*
d_ex_gym_03_48,Keeya!
d_ex_gym_03_49,Hehe!
d_ex_gym_03_50,Ann and Noah continue to go tit for tat.
d_ex_gym_03_51,Time out! How are you not worn out?!
d_ex_gym_03_52,Are you feeling a little tired?
d_ex_gym_03_53,"N-no! I was just worried that you might be tired, that's all."
d_ex_gym_03_54,"Wow, that's so thoughtful of you! Sure, we can take a breather."
d_ex_gym_03_55,"You were right on the money, Teacher. All I have to do is keep my eyes on the shuttlecock, and the rest is easy!"
d_ex_gym_03_56,Ea-easy? That's it! You're going down!
d_ex_gym_03_57,... Huff.
d_ex_gym_03_58,Smash!
d_ex_gym_03_59,*Pow*
d_ex_gym_03_60,Noah smashes the ball at full force. The ball hurdles towards Ann at near-light speed.
d_ex_gym_03_61,*Pow*
d_ex_gym_03_62,!!
d_ex_gym_03_63,That looks fun! I'll give it a try too!
d_ex_gym_03_64,Ya!
d_ex_gym_03_65,*Pow* *Puff*
d_ex_gym_03_66,...
d_ex_gym_03_67,...
d_ex_gym_03_68,... Ann wins.
d_ex_gym_03_69,That's impossible... this pipsqueak beat me?!
d_ex_gym_03_70,Good game.
d_ex_gym_03_71,Who's the loser now?
d_ex_gym_03_72,We're not done here!
d_ex_gym_03_73,What?! You watch your mouth!
d_ex_gym_03_74,I'm not out of the game just yet!
d_ex_gym_03_75,One more round.
d_ex_gym_03_76,"Sure, that'd be fun!"
d_ex_gym_03_77,"Noah clenches her racket, panting heavily."
d_ex_gym_03_78,Something tells me this match won't be over anytime soon.
d_ex_hospital_01_title,Let Mary treat you!
d_ex_hospital_01_1,So...
d_ex_hospital_01_2,"You are here because you have a toothache. Right, Epinel?"
d_ex_hospital_01_3,Just... a slight pain.
d_ex_hospital_01_4,Coach made a fuss and forced me to come.
d_ex_hospital_01_5,The bubble she popped today is not the same size she usually pops.
d_ex_hospital_01_6,"Oh, is that so?"
d_ex_hospital_01_7,They always come in different sizes...
d_ex_hospital_01_8,Really?
d_ex_hospital_01_9,"So, this swollen cheek you are experiencing is because"
d_ex_hospital_01_10,you are popping bubbles inside your mouth?
d_ex_hospital_01_11,Mary pokes Epinel's swollen cheek.
d_ex_hospital_01_12,!!
d_ex_hospital_01_13,Epinel shivers slightly.
d_ex_hospital_01_14,"My, did you just shiver?"
d_ex_hospital_01_15,"No, I just got an itch."
d_ex_hospital_01_16,"Oh, is that true?"
d_ex_hospital_01_17,So it doesn't matter if I poke it again?
d_ex_hospital_01_18,*Poke*
d_ex_hospital_01_19,!!!
d_ex_hospital_01_20,It doesn't hurt...
d_ex_hospital_01_21,*Poke poke*
d_ex_hospital_01_22,It doesn't...
d_ex_hospital_01_23,*Poke poke poke*
d_ex_hospital_01_24,Errrrr...
d_ex_hospital_01_25,*Poke poke poke poke*
d_ex_hospital_01_26,...
d_ex_hospital_01_27,How does it feel now? Still doesn't hurt?
d_ex_hospital_01_28,Epinel's eyes are flooded with tears.
d_ex_hospital_01_29,Epinel.
d_ex_hospital_01_30,A Nikke in pain is a serious problem.
d_ex_hospital_01_31,...
d_ex_hospital_01_32,"If we leave it alone,"
d_ex_hospital_01_33,you might have to ask your boss to make a new set of teeth for you in the future.
d_ex_hospital_01_34,!!
d_ex_hospital_01_35,They will use that as an excuse and force you to take all kinds of medications...
d_ex_hospital_01_36,Are you okay with that?
d_ex_hospital_01_37,It...
d_ex_hospital_01_38,hurts...
d_ex_hospital_01_39,"Hehe. Compared to bothering your boss, it's better to listen to me. Don't you agree?"
d_ex_hospital_01_40,Epinel thinks for a moment and nods in agreement.
d_ex_hospital_01_41,So give up chewing bubble gum!
d_ex_hospital_01_42,!!!
d_ex_hospital_01_43,Why?
d_ex_hospital_01_44,"Because some of your teeth are decayed, Epinel."
d_ex_hospital_01_45,You chew too much bubble gum.
d_ex_hospital_01_46,"I'm a Nikke! How is that possible?
How could my teeth decay just by chewing bubble gum?"
d_ex_hospital_01_47,"Whoa, are you questioning a doctor's diagnosis?"
d_ex_hospital_01_48,I guess I just have to tell your boss...
d_ex_hospital_01_49,Epinel grabs Mary's sleeve.
d_ex_hospital_01_50,??
d_ex_hospital_01_51,For... for how long?
d_ex_hospital_01_52,When can I chew bubble gum again?
d_ex_hospital_01_53,Is bubble gum that important to you?
d_ex_hospital_01_54,It's not that...
d_ex_hospital_01_55,...
d_ex_hospital_01_56,...
d_ex_hospital_01_57,Very well.
d_ex_hospital_01_58,I made something just in case it was necessary. I think they can help you.
d_ex_hospital_01_59,Mary pulls out a box of bubble gum and hands it over to Epinel.
d_ex_hospital_01_60,This is...
d_ex_hospital_01_61,"It's treatment bubble gum called ""Hyvaa Hyvaa"""
d_ex_hospital_01_62,Hyvaa... Hyvaa?
d_ex_hospital_01_63,"It's not tasty, but you have to chew these instead of regular ones. Understand?"
d_ex_hospital_01_64,Got it.
d_ex_hospital_01_65,You are free to go.
d_ex_hospital_01_66,See you next week.
d_ex_hospital_01_67,Epinel leaves the consulting room begrudgingly.
d_ex_hospital_01_68,Why didn't you just give her the treatment bubble gum from the start?
d_ex_hospital_01_69,Well... I could have done that.
d_ex_hospital_01_70,"But that's boring, isn't it?"
d_ex_hospital_01_71,"Don't tell me you don't want to see Epinel's cute reaction, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_01_72,...
d_ex_hospital_01_73,Hehe. Then don't forget to bring me more cute patients next time.
d_ex_hospital_02_title,Emergency Patients
d_ex_hospital_02_1,"Ah, Commander, what brings you to the hospital?"
d_ex_hospital_02_2,What troubles you?
d_ex_hospital_02_3,Just passing by.
d_ex_hospital_02_4,"Hehe, I see."
d_ex_hospital_02_5,"I'm not busy now, so..."
d_ex_hospital_02_6,Senpai! We got an emergency patient!
d_ex_hospital_02_7,?!
d_ex_hospital_02_8,Pepper pushes a hospital bed and comes in.
d_ex_hospital_02_9,Emergency patient? Who is...
d_ex_hospital_02_10,...
d_ex_hospital_02_11,"So it's an ""emergency"" patient, not a critical patient."
d_ex_hospital_02_12,Scarlet is lying on the bed with her eyes closed.
d_ex_hospital_02_13,A Pilgrim...
d_ex_hospital_02_14,We found her fainted in front of the Command Center.
d_ex_hospital_02_15,Were there any witnesses on the way to the hospital?
d_ex_hospital_02_16,No.
d_ex_hospital_02_17,I see.
d_ex_hospital_02_18,"First, I can't see any sign of wounds or fractures."
d_ex_hospital_02_19,"You have done well, Pepper."
d_ex_hospital_02_20,Bring her to the innermost ward.
d_ex_hospital_02_21,Shouldn't we contact the authorities first?
d_ex_hospital_02_22,No need.
d_ex_hospital_02_23,"This Nikke patient, you know her, right, Commander?"
d_ex_hospital_02_24,"Yes, I know this Nikke."
d_ex_hospital_02_25,"No, I don't know this Nikkie."
d_ex_hospital_02_26,Thanks for telling me the truth.
d_ex_hospital_02_27,You got a little nervous when you saw that patient's face.
d_ex_hospital_02_28,"Hehe. You are a nice guardian, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_29,It's important to protect patients' privacy.
d_ex_hospital_02_30,"Hehe. You are a nice guardian, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_31,"It doesn't matter if the patient is a Pilgrim or not, nor your relationship with her, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_32,What matters is she needs treatment.
d_ex_hospital_02_33,"For the same reason, you brought her to the hospital first instead of reporting to the authorities.
Isn't that right, Pepper?"
d_ex_hospital_02_34,I...
d_ex_hospital_02_35,We are doctors.
d_ex_hospital_02_36,...
d_ex_hospital_02_37,"Yes, ma'am! I will bring her to the ward!"
d_ex_hospital_02_38,"Thanks, Pepper."
d_ex_hospital_02_39,"I need to check on her. Please wait here, guardian."
d_ex_hospital_02_40,Soon after.
d_ex_hospital_02_41,Pepper and Mary come out of the ward.
d_ex_hospital_02_42,So how is it going?
d_ex_hospital_02_43,"I'm not sure if it's because her parts hadn't been examined for a long time,
but she seemed to have suffered a malfunction."
d_ex_hospital_02_44,"We couldn't replace her parts, but we managed to clean them."
d_ex_hospital_02_45,So don't you worry!
d_ex_hospital_02_46,I was asking about you.
d_ex_hospital_02_47,Ah... me?
d_ex_hospital_02_48,"I'm fine, for sure!"
d_ex_hospital_02_49,I just got... so impressed by senpai.
d_ex_hospital_02_50,"Whenever I get confused, she points me in the right direction..."
d_ex_hospital_02_51,"Oh dear, it feels so embarrassing."
d_ex_hospital_02_52,I must work harder to learn from her!
d_ex_hospital_02_53,"Hehe, thanks for your concern, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_54,"Just like I said, you are a good guardian, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_55,"The treatment is done, will you contact the authorities?"
d_ex_hospital_02_56,"Ah, about that, senpai..."
d_ex_hospital_02_57,"No, it's up to you to decide."
d_ex_hospital_02_58,Me?
d_ex_hospital_02_59,"Sure, you brought the patient here."
d_ex_hospital_02_60,I will respect your choice no matter what it is.
d_ex_hospital_02_61,I-I...
d_ex_hospital_02_62,...
d_ex_hospital_02_63,I won't contact them.
d_ex_hospital_02_64,!
d_ex_hospital_02_65,"In principle, we need to contact the authorities
as soon as we discover a Pilgrim."
d_ex_hospital_02_66,"But today, we are just patients and doctors."
d_ex_hospital_02_67,"Isn't that right, guardian? Hehe."
d_ex_hospital_02_68,Hehe. It looks like we have come to a conclusion!
d_ex_hospital_02_69,"The patient will wake up soon,
can you watch over her in the ward before that, guardian?"
d_ex_hospital_02_70,Should I ring the bell to call you when the patient wakes up?
d_ex_hospital_02_71,Eh... there's really no need for that.
d_ex_hospital_02_72,Just say something to encourage her.
d_ex_hospital_02_73,Mary gives me a meaningful smile. I open the door of the ward.
d_ex_hospital_02_74,Cold wind blows in from the wide-open window.
d_ex_hospital_02_75,There's no one in the ward.
d_ex_hospital_02_76,The patient has gone.
d_ex_hospital_02_77,"Ah, it looks like she woke up earlier than I thought."
d_ex_hospital_02_78,Well it's a good thing she's healthy again!
d_ex_hospital_02_79,"Mary finds something while making the bed
and smiles."
d_ex_hospital_02_80,Well.
d_ex_hospital_02_81,It looks like the patient has paid for her treatment. Now it's the time to welcome new patients.
d_ex_hospital_02_82,"And, please accept the thing she used as payment for us, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_02_83,"Pepper, shall we go?"
d_ex_hospital_02_84,"Yes, senpai."
d_ex_hospital_02_85,... Payment?
d_ex_hospital_02_86,I look around to see a beautiful white wine bottle on the bedside table.
d_ex_hospital_03_title,A Little Nurse
d_ex_hospital_03_1,"At the very least, you'll have to stay in the hospital overnight."
d_ex_hospital_03_2,I really don't think it's that serious.
d_ex_hospital_03_3,"Now Commander, who is the doctor here?"
d_ex_hospital_03_4,You've been pushing yourself too hard lately.
d_ex_hospital_03_5,"I'll put you on an IV drip, and I want you to take it easy, understand?"
d_ex_hospital_03_6,"I'm just a little tired, that's all."
d_ex_hospital_03_7,"I'll need a caregiver to keep tabs on... Um, I mean look after you."
d_ex_hospital_03_8,"As for me, I have to move on to my next patient."
d_ex_hospital_03_9,"I'm okay, honestly..."
d_ex_hospital_03_10,I've already instructed the nearest Nikke in the vicinity to come to the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_03_11,Don't even think about running off. What you need is some rest!
d_ex_hospital_03_12,Which Nikke?
d_ex_hospital_03_13,"Well, I'm not sure. The emergency button here simply calls for the nearest Nikke, so I can't say who it'll be."
d_ex_hospital_03_14,Now be good and rest up!
d_ex_hospital_03_15,...
d_ex_hospital_03_16,"As I lie on the bed with my IV drip, I begin to feel groggy."
d_ex_hospital_03_17,... My eyelids are beginning to feel heavy.
d_ex_hospital_03_18,... Eyes...
d_ex_hospital_03_19,*Bang*
d_ex_hospital_03_20,?!
d_ex_hospital_03_21,Pssh... Haha...
d_ex_hospital_03_22,"My goodness, what happened? Let me guess: you're so feeble that you got sick."
d_ex_hospital_03_23,That would happen to a weakling like you.
d_ex_hospital_03_24,Noah? What are you doing here?
d_ex_hospital_03_25,"I got summoned here by the hospital, duh!"
d_ex_hospital_03_26,"There I was minding my own business, and this thing suddenly went off."
d_ex_hospital_03_27,"So, here I am! At your service, hehe!"
d_ex_hospital_03_28,What were you doing so close to the hospital?
d_ex_hospital_03_29,"I just wanted to check if you are better recently, so I decided to come for a visit. Guess what, I saw someone go into this hospital."
d_ex_hospital_03_30,And I wondered who that guy was and why they were so puny that they even needed to come to the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_03_31,"And to my surprise, it was you, Imposter!"
d_ex_hospital_03_32,Hee hee...
d_ex_hospital_03_33,...
d_ex_hospital_03_34,"Anyway, I'll be responsible for looking after you."
d_ex_hospital_03_35,So...
d_ex_hospital_03_36,what exactly do I need to do?
d_ex_hospital_03_37,I've never really done this before.
d_ex_hospital_03_38,You can just go home.
d_ex_hospital_03_39,Get me some water then.
d_ex_hospital_03_40,You really want me to leave?
d_ex_hospital_03_41,Yes.
d_ex_hospital_03_42,Hee hee.
d_ex_hospital_03_43,"Then say it nicer. Say, ""Oh great and powerful Noah, I hereby permit you to leave the hospital."""
d_ex_hospital_03_44,"Oh great and powerful Noah, I hereby permit you to leave the hospital."
d_ex_hospital_03_45,Say nothing.
d_ex_hospital_03_46,Now why on earth would I do that?
d_ex_hospital_03_47,"I can't leave a poor sap like you here alone, bedridden and unable to move without assistance."
d_ex_hospital_03_48,Pssh... you could at least play along...
d_ex_hospital_03_49,I'm not leaving until you say something.
d_ex_hospital_03_50,Water?
d_ex_hospital_03_51,Sure.
d_ex_hospital_03_52,"Noah heads out into the hall to fetch a bottle of water from the fridge, then comes back."
d_ex_hospital_03_53,"Here, drink up."
d_ex_hospital_03_54,...
d_ex_hospital_03_55,Thank...
d_ex_hospital_03_56,"Just as my hand is about to grasp the bottle, Noah yanks it back."
d_ex_hospital_03_57,"Oooh, too slow!"
d_ex_hospital_03_58,...
d_ex_hospital_03_59,I can feel a headache coming on.
d_ex_hospital_03_60,Hee hee.
d_ex_hospital_03_61,"I close my eyes and try to ignore Noah, who is standing beside me cackling with glee."
d_ex_hospital_03_62,"Aw c'mon, you're no fun. I came all the way here, and you're just going to sleep?"
d_ex_hospital_03_63,...
d_ex_hospital_03_64,HEY!
d_ex_hospital_03_65,"... You're actually sick, aren't you?"
d_ex_hospital_03_66,Then... you shouldn't... um...
d_ex_hospital_03_67,You ought to... er...
d_ex_hospital_03_68,*Sigh*
d_ex_hospital_03_69,After some time.
d_ex_hospital_03_70,Huh...
d_ex_hospital_03_71,You're finally awake!
d_ex_hospital_03_72,You're looking much better now.
d_ex_hospital_03_73,... Did I fall asleep?
d_ex_hospital_03_74,You sure did. Slept like a baby too.
d_ex_hospital_03_75,Whoever the Nikke was who came to take care of you did a great job.
d_ex_hospital_03_76,...
d_ex_hospital_03_77,I can still hear Noah's laughter echoing inside my head.
d_ex_hospital_03_78,"Your IV is all finished, and you've got some shut-eye, so you won't have to spend the night here after all."
d_ex_hospital_03_79,"But I still want you to come back for a follow-up, you hear?"
d_ex_hospital_03_80,"Understood, but the next time I come, you have to be the one who looks after me."
d_ex_hospital_03_81,What's wrong? Did you have a scary nightmare?
d_ex_hospital_03_82,"Hehe. Okay, I will."
d_ex_hospital_03_83,Mary escorts me out of the hospital.
d_ex_hotel_01_title,Hotel and Sour Grapes
d_ex_hotel_01_1,Eh? Look at that!
d_ex_hotel_01_2,There's a hotel!
d_ex_hotel_01_3,Whoa! Where did that come from?
d_ex_hotel_01_4,"A hotel in the Outpost,"
d_ex_hotel_01_5,can we use it as our dormitory?
d_ex_hotel_01_6,No.
d_ex_hotel_01_7,That was built following a certain squad's request.
d_ex_hotel_01_8,A certain squad's... request?
d_ex_hotel_01_9,What does that mean?
d_ex_hotel_01_10,They live in this great hotel but not our small dorm?
d_ex_hotel_01_11,Who knows?
d_ex_hotel_01_12,All that I know is that a squad requested that building and it's up to us to make it come true.
d_ex_hotel_01_13,Liter told you that?
d_ex_hotel_01_14,Yeah.
d_ex_hotel_01_15,Even Mighty Tools don't know the real story. How can a squad have so much sway?
d_ex_hotel_01_16,How about we request another hotel?
d_ex_hotel_01_17,I guess everyone will be happy.
d_ex_hotel_01_18,"Yeah, that's a great idea! We want one too!"
d_ex_hotel_01_19,That's not possible.
d_ex_hotel_01_20,Why not?
d_ex_hotel_01_21,"Because unlike the other squads, we're a penal unit."
d_ex_hotel_01_22,!!
d_ex_hotel_01_23,Th- that's still affecting us even now?
d_ex_hotel_01_24,...
d_ex_hotel_01_25,We can't do anything about it.
d_ex_hotel_01_26,We will forever live in that shabby dorm... stand in shabby bathrooms... use shabby shower heads... and have shabby showers...
d_ex_hotel_01_27,...
d_ex_hotel_01_28,...
d_ex_hotel_01_29,...
d_ex_hotel_01_30,Living in that hotel must be worse than in our dorm.
d_ex_hotel_01_31,Huh?
d_ex_hotel_01_32,It looks so gloomy.
d_ex_hotel_01_33,"And if you didn't notice, only one squad of Nikkes live in such a huge building."
d_ex_hotel_01_34,That's the perfect place for ghost stories!
d_ex_hotel_01_35,"To request such a scary building,
they must be scary people!"
d_ex_hotel_01_36,... Anis.
d_ex_hotel_01_37,She's right!
d_ex_hotel_01_38,Water will never come out from their shower heads!
d_ex_hotel_01_39,"Ours may be shabby, but at least we have water! I'm sure they won't have water when they move in!"
d_ex_hotel_01_40,We also didn't have water when we moved in.
d_ex_hotel_01_41,Then they won't have water forever!
d_ex_hotel_01_42,"They also won't have sodas! No, they won't even have a refrigerator!"
d_ex_hotel_01_43,"Yeah! Living in such an ugly place, their firepower is sure to go down!"
d_ex_hotel_01_44,Hear hear!
d_ex_hotel_01_45,...
d_ex_hotel_01_46,"Let's leave this place, Commander."
d_ex_hotel_01_47,All right.
d_ex_hotel_02_title,Mystery Hotel
d_ex_hotel_02_1,This should be enough.
d_ex_hotel_02_2,Thanks for coming.
d_ex_hotel_02_3,I know I called you out of the blue.
d_ex_hotel_02_4,Is everything taken care of?
d_ex_hotel_02_5,"All fixed up. Should last for another few decades, I'd say."
d_ex_hotel_02_6,Should we move on to the next order of business?
d_ex_hotel_02_7,We've got some time to kill before we have to leave.
d_ex_hotel_02_8,Let's spend an hour or two at the hotel.
d_ex_hotel_02_9,Are we allow to do that?!
d_ex_hotel_02_10,"Yes, we are."
d_ex_hotel_02_11,"When the request came in,"
d_ex_hotel_02_12,"they offered to give us a room once the repairs were finished, so we could relax."
d_ex_hotel_02_13,They even sent a room key.
d_ex_hotel_02_14,"Thanks to Greenhorn, we finished up early,"
d_ex_hotel_02_15,so we can kick back and relax before we head back out.
d_ex_hotel_02_16,It's been a while since we had some proper R&R.
d_ex_hotel_02_17,"You pulled your weight too, Greenhorn, so you can join us."
d_ex_hotel_02_18,Okay.
d_ex_hotel_02_19,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_20,Anyone here?
d_ex_hotel_02_21,They invited us over and no one's even in the lobby...
d_ex_hotel_02_22,Where are their basic manners?
d_ex_hotel_02_23,Which squad is assigned to this building?
d_ex_hotel_02_24,Beats me.
d_ex_hotel_02_25,Is there really no one here?
d_ex_hotel_02_26,Liter's voice echoes across the empty hotel lobby.
d_ex_hotel_02_27,Silent as a tomb in here.
d_ex_hotel_02_28,"But the lobby's totally immaculate, as if it was just cleaned."
d_ex_hotel_02_29,There isn't a spec of dust anywhere. Not even the window sills.
d_ex_hotel_02_30,"Well, that's a good sign."
d_ex_hotel_02_31,"It's been well maintained, that's for sure."
d_ex_hotel_02_32,The chairs are very comfy too.
d_ex_hotel_02_33,"Yeah, I've never sat in such a comfy chair!"
d_ex_hotel_02_34,Hmph.
d_ex_hotel_02_35,"Well, there's no point in waiting for someone to show up."
d_ex_hotel_02_36,Let's just head up to the rooms.
d_ex_hotel_02_37,All right!
d_ex_hotel_02_38,Hotel room.
d_ex_hotel_02_39,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_40,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_41,!!
d_ex_hotel_02_42,"Wow, check out these digs! It's even separated into different rooms."
d_ex_hotel_02_43,The beds are so soft too!
d_ex_hotel_02_44,It's like sleeping on a cloud!
d_ex_hotel_02_45,"Haha, you're awfully excited."
d_ex_hotel_02_46,The bathtub even has water jets.
d_ex_hotel_02_47,"Nice, that'll be perfect for working the kinks out of my shoulders."
d_ex_hotel_02_48,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_49,You can open and close the curtains just by pushing a button!
d_ex_hotel_02_50,It's all so modern.
d_ex_hotel_02_51,It's nice to see that one of the buildings
d_ex_hotel_02_52,we constructed are being put to good use.
d_ex_hotel_02_53,"Yeah, really makes you feel pride in your work."
d_ex_hotel_02_54,"*Knock, knock.*"
d_ex_hotel_02_55,Who is it?
d_ex_hotel_02_56,Must be the hotel owner.
d_ex_hotel_02_57,Better answer it.
d_ex_hotel_02_58,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_59,No one's there!
d_ex_hotel_02_60,Huh? There's a trolley...
d_ex_hotel_02_61,Anything on it?
d_ex_hotel_02_62,Just some snacks... and a note!
d_ex_hotel_02_63,What does it say?
d_ex_hotel_02_64,Let's see...
d_ex_hotel_02_65,"It says, ""We prepared some snacks for you. Have a nice rest."""
d_ex_hotel_02_66,Sounds like something you'd write.
d_ex_hotel_02_67,You're just saying that 'cause I'm the one who read it!
d_ex_hotel_02_68,The hotel owner certainly is an unusual fellow...
d_ex_hotel_02_69,Must be shy.
d_ex_hotel_02_70,Maybe they prefer to stay behind the scenes.
d_ex_hotel_02_71,"With a personality like that, they're in the wrong business."
d_ex_hotel_02_72,"I'd be curious to see the owner's face,"
d_ex_hotel_02_73,but there must be a reason why they're staying out of sight.
d_ex_hotel_02_74,"Well anyway, let's take their advice"
d_ex_hotel_02_75,and enjoy ourselves.
d_ex_hotel_02_76,All right!
d_ex_hotel_02_77,I'm gonna jump in the tub and let those water jets work me over.
d_ex_hotel_02_78,I'm gonna lay on this comfy bed and eat some snacks.
d_ex_hotel_02_79,Soon after.
d_ex_hotel_02_80,This hotel is awesome!
d_ex_hotel_02_81,This might be the best hotel I've ever been to.
d_ex_hotel_02_82,Have you been to a lot of hotels?
d_ex_hotel_02_83,"No, today's my first time."
d_ex_hotel_02_84,...
d_ex_hotel_02_85,*Knock knock*
d_ex_hotel_02_86,!!
d_ex_hotel_02_87,I'll get it.
d_ex_hotel_02_88,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_02_89,No one again!
d_ex_hotel_02_90,They must be quick on their feet. There's another trolley.
d_ex_hotel_02_91,"Wow, all this food smells amazing! It must be super fresh too, just look at the steam coming off it."
d_ex_hotel_02_92,Now I'm really starting to get curious about this hotel.
d_ex_hotel_02_93,"Still, can't complain about the service."
d_ex_hotel_02_94,"Anyway, it's time to move on to the next assignment."
d_ex_hotel_02_95,"Let's finish eating, pack our belongings, and head out."
d_ex_hotel_02_96,Huh? There's a note underneath the dish.
d_ex_hotel_02_97,Let me read it!
d_ex_hotel_02_98,It says
d_ex_hotel_02_99,"""Hope you had a nice rest. Everything is in the house, so you can leave whenever you like. I hope you've enjoyed your stay at our hotel."""
d_ex_hotel_02_100,"We may not have seen their face, but the owner certainly seems like a nice person."
d_ex_hotel_02_101,That's right! The service was spectacular!
d_ex_hotel_02_102,This was a nice little mini-vacation.
d_ex_hotel_02_103,Vacation is a bit of an exaggeration...
d_ex_hotel_02_104,"Anyway, if I ever come again, I hope I can get a look at the owner."
d_ex_hotel_02_105,"With many questions left unanswered, we all left the mysterious hotel."
d_ex_hotel_03_title,The Mobius Strip
d_ex_hotel_03_1,"Finally, I arrived at the Hotel Staycation."
d_ex_hotel_03_2,"I had just been through a slew of missions, and wanted nothing more than some R&R, free of any distractions"
d_ex_hotel_03_3,This hotel seemed to be just what the doctor ordered.
d_ex_hotel_03_4,"The entire hotel, from top to bottom, was completely unmanned. Every single staff member, from the receptionist to the manager, was instead replaced by an automated machine."
d_ex_hotel_03_5,"Not only that, this place was very much under the radar. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop."
d_ex_hotel_03_6,... *Squeak* ♪
d_ex_hotel_03_7,"... Yes, quiet as a..."
d_ex_hotel_03_8,*Quack squeak... Quack... ♯ Quack squeak ♪ Squeak*
d_ex_hotel_03_9,Knock on the wall between this room and the adjacent room.
d_ex_hotel_03_10,Go to the adjacent room.

d_ex_hotel_03_15,The noise is getting even louder!

d_ex_hotel_03_17,Hey! Open up!
d_ex_hotel_03_18,One moment!
d_ex_hotel_03_19,I'll be right there. I just want to finish this section first.
d_ex_hotel_03_20,"Oh, Conductor, it's you! You scared me."
d_ex_hotel_03_21,I didn't expect anyone would be listening in such a deserted hotel.
d_ex_hotel_03_22,So you didn't expect anyone to be listening... Is that why you were playing so... esoterically?
d_ex_hotel_03_23,!!
d_ex_hotel_03_24,Not at all!
d_ex_hotel_03_25,"Actually, I originally intended on playing something easier on the ears."
d_ex_hotel_03_26,But every time I start to play...
d_ex_hotel_03_27,*Boom*
d_ex_hotel_03_28,the room next to mine goes berserk! It sounds like the end of days in there...
d_ex_hotel_03_29,"*Bang, bang, bang* *Crush*"
d_ex_hotel_03_30,"Once it starts, it doesn't let up, so eventually the music I was playing became just as shrill in turn."
d_ex_hotel_03_31,... Can you hear it now?
d_ex_hotel_03_32,Can you not?
d_ex_hotel_03_33,"Sorry, I can't tell which sound is real and which is from my imagination at this point."
d_ex_hotel_03_34,...
d_ex_hotel_03_35,"If you can get them to cut out that awful racket,"
d_ex_hotel_03_36,I'm positive that I'll be able to play properly once again.
d_ex_hotel_03_37,I'll talk to them.
d_ex_hotel_03_38,"A moment later, I located the second source of the supposed commotion."
d_ex_hotel_03_39,"*Knock, knock*"
d_ex_hotel_03_40,...
d_ex_hotel_03_41,... Who's there? I'm not expecting any other visitors!
d_ex_hotel_03_42,I'm staying in the room two doors down. I'd like to have a word with you.
d_ex_hotel_03_43,!!
d_ex_hotel_03_44,"Oh, um... one second. I just have to tidy up a bit."
d_ex_hotel_03_45,...
d_ex_hotel_03_46,...
d_ex_hotel_03_47,So...
d_ex_hotel_03_48,"I apologize if I've disturbed you, but there was a good reason for it."
d_ex_hotel_03_49,"We had planned to come here and do some trading. You know, to keep it all hush-hush."
d_ex_hotel_03_50,But these strange noises kept coming from the room close to us.
d_ex_hotel_03_51,*Beep beep beep*
d_ex_hotel_03_52,It could be a trap set by a rival organization or a monitoring device installed by some government agents.
d_ex_hotel_03_53,"I was planning on getting rid of it quietly, but the sound is coming from inside the wall."
d_ex_hotel_03_54,So all I can do is smash through the wall.
d_ex_hotel_03_55,Sorry for making such a commotion.
d_ex_hotel_03_56,*Beep beep beep*
d_ex_hotel_03_57,Is that the noise?
d_ex_hotel_03_58,"Yeah, it's been going on for a while now."
d_ex_hotel_03_59,"If I can't find the source of that infernal sound, I'll tear this entire hotel apart brick by brick."
d_ex_hotel_03_60,Please don't.
d_ex_hotel_03_61,You know I'm not playing around.
d_ex_hotel_03_62,And my patience is running really thin.
d_ex_hotel_03_63,...
d_ex_hotel_03_64,"I have to find where that noise is coming from in order to stop Dolla from going on a rampage, amongst other things."
d_ex_hotel_03_65,"A moment later, I managed to locate the source of the third sound."
d_ex_hotel_03_66,*Knock knock* *Knock knock knock*
d_ex_hotel_03_67,Who is it?! What do you want?
d_ex_hotel_03_68,Say why you're here.
d_ex_hotel_03_69,Keep knocking on the door.
d_ex_hotel_03_70,"With the utmost seriousness, I explain the noise problem to the woman inside."
d_ex_hotel_03_71,"Wait, that voice..."
d_ex_hotel_03_72,Don't you have any manners?!
d_ex_hotel_03_73,"Relax, I'm coming! If you keep beating on that door, I'm gonna beat you on the head."
d_ex_hotel_03_74,*Bang*
d_ex_hotel_03_75,... {AccountData.NickName}? I didn't expect to see you here.
d_ex_hotel_03_76,What are you doing here? This entire place is about to be nothing but rubble.
d_ex_hotel_03_77,What?!
d_ex_hotel_03_78,"Despite the fact that the entire place has no actual staff, I had heard good things about the service here."
d_ex_hotel_03_79,I came here all the way from the Outer Rim.
d_ex_hotel_03_80,"However, the second I got here, all I could hear were people stomping around upstairs."
d_ex_hotel_03_81,"Not only that, they had the TV blaring at full blast."
d_ex_hotel_03_82,It's been like this for hours.
d_ex_hotel_03_83,"I tried being civilized and calling the front desk,"
d_ex_hotel_03_84,but then I remembered that this place doesn't have any actual staff.
d_ex_hotel_03_85,So I decided the next best thing was to blow it to smithereens.
d_ex_hotel_03_86,*Beep beep beep*
d_ex_hotel_03_87,And it just so happens I've got a timebomb in my luggage.
d_ex_hotel_03_88,"Using Crow's room number, I try to figure out"
d_ex_hotel_03_89,the true culprit behind this series of noise complaints. As it turns out...
d_ex_hotel_03_90,...
d_ex_hotel_03_91,Hmm? What is it?
d_ex_hotel_03_92,I'm sorry.
d_ex_hotel_03_93,Huh? Sorry for what?
d_ex_hotel_03_94,"I've been looking forward so much to this vacation, I guess I got a little carried away."

d_ex_library_01_title,Library Ghost Story
d_ex_library_01_1,"11:00 PM, Outpost Library"
d_ex_library_01_2,Hi-! My lovely Lupins☆
d_ex_library_01_3,Thanks for tuning into Rupee's Shopaholics Anonymous.
d_ex_library_01_4,"You may be expecting me to throw money around flippantly, but no! I've got something better!"
d_ex_library_01_5,Today's vlog is about ghost stories!
d_ex_library_01_6,I chose this topic because many of you are interested in the 7 Outpost mysteries.
d_ex_library_01_7,Shall we go ahead and introduce our special guest?
d_ex_library_01_8,Joining us once again is the spectacular Commander.
d_ex_library_01_9,Hello.
d_ex_library_01_10,"Next, we have the self-proclaimed unscareable Drake!"
d_ex_library_01_11,"Pssh, if anything, this will just put me to sleep."
d_ex_library_01_12,"A laughing stock is precisely that, regardless if they're living or dead."
d_ex_library_01_13,You certainly talk a big game!
d_ex_library_01_14,"However, the important thing is will you feel that way by the end of our program?"
d_ex_library_01_15,"All right, let the adventure begin!"
d_ex_library_01_16,11:30 PM. Library 1st floor reading room.
d_ex_library_01_17,"Before we start exploring the library,"
d_ex_library_01_18,I'll give you a short explanation about this place's backstory.
d_ex_library_01_19,This library is home to one of the 7 mysteries of the Outpost.
d_ex_library_01_20,"When the clock strikes midnight, behind the 4th bookshelf..."
d_ex_library_01_21,it's said that you can hear cries of anguish.
d_ex_library_01_22,"There is a rumor that the voice is from a ghost sealed within a book,"
d_ex_library_01_23,or someone buried alive in the library walls crying out for help.
d_ex_library_01_24,"Today, we're here to find out the truth behind it all!"
d_ex_library_01_25,Ha! Easy-peasy!
d_ex_library_01_26,I can locate Rapture radio signals.
d_ex_library_01_27,Ghosts are child's play in comparison.
d_ex_library_01_28,We're counting on you.
d_ex_library_01_29,You're awfully cocky.
d_ex_library_01_30,"Of course I am, 'cause I'm awesome!"
d_ex_library_01_31,"00:00 AM, 1st floor of library."
d_ex_library_01_32,Can everyone see?
d_ex_library_01_33,"It's midnight, and we are currently in front of the 4th bookshelf."
d_ex_library_01_34,"According to the rumor, we should hear wailing."
d_ex_library_01_35,Maybe the ghost is too stupid to know we're here.
d_ex_library_01_36,I'll knock and let it know.
d_ex_library_01_37,"No, wait!"
d_ex_library_01_38,*Knock knock*
d_ex_library_01_39,...
d_ex_library_01_40,See? No respons...
d_ex_library_01_41,*Bang bang*
d_ex_library_01_42,Gyah!
d_ex_library_01_43,What the hell was that?!
d_ex_library_01_44,A poltergeist.
d_ex_library_01_45,Poltergeist?
d_ex_library_01_46,"That's when a ghost appears and causes physical disturbances, like moving objects or making sounds."
d_ex_library_01_47,"At least, that's how I understand it."
d_ex_library_01_48,"So if it's a poltergeist, where is it?"
d_ex_library_01_49,Kyaaa!!!
d_ex_library_01_50,"You're too loud, Rupee!"
d_ex_library_01_51,That wasn't me!
d_ex_library_01_52,...
d_ex_library_01_53,...
d_ex_library_01_54,*Creak creak creak*
d_ex_library_01_55,Wah! It's really here!
d_ex_library_01_56,...
d_ex_library_01_57,Even the courageous Drake has gone quiet!!!
d_ex_library_01_58,*Bang* *Bang* *Bang! Bang! Bang*
d_ex_library_01_59,*Clatters*
d_ex_library_01_60,Would you shut up?!
d_ex_library_01_61,*Dadadadadadadadada*
d_ex_library_01_62,A ghost is heading right for us!
d_ex_library_01_63,N-no!
d_ex_library_01_64,Run while hugging Rupee.
d_ex_library_01_65,Carry Drake on your back and run.
d_ex_library_01_66,Run!!
d_ex_library_01_67,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
d_ex_library_01_68,Don't just leave me here!
d_ex_library_01_69,*Swing*
d_ex_library_01_70,We've only moved a few steps when a door behind us opens.
d_ex_library_01_71,*Thump thump*
d_ex_library_01_72,There is the sound of footsteps drawing near.
d_ex_library_01_73,Tsk...
d_ex_library_01_74,I was wondering who was making such a ruckus.
d_ex_library_01_75,I should have known it was you.
d_ex_library_01_76,Look back.
d_ex_library_01_77,... Weakling.
d_ex_library_01_78,*Gulp*
d_ex_library_01_79,Eunhwa?
d_ex_library_01_80,I'm just glad you aren't a ghost!
d_ex_library_01_81,What?
d_ex_library_01_82,You need to get your head examined.
d_ex_library_01_83,Listen up. I've got an important mission early tomorrow morning.
d_ex_library_01_84,"I put a lot of work into it, and I don't need you nimrods screwing it up."
d_ex_library_01_85,"So get out of here, before I really get mean. This is your last warning."
d_ex_library_01_86,Understood.
d_ex_library_01_87,Wouldn't want to disturb your studies.
d_ex_library_01_88,"Let's head back, fellow nimrods."
d_ex_library_01_89,Yes...
d_ex_library_01_90,"But, all those sounds we heard today..."
d_ex_library_01_91,"You didn't make them by any chance, did you?"
d_ex_library_01_92,What sounds?
d_ex_library_01_93,"Sure, I was pounding on the walls"
d_ex_library_01_94,cause you were all being so damn loud.
d_ex_library_01_95,But...
d_ex_library_01_96,what about all that screaming?
d_ex_library_01_97,Kyaaa!!! Argh!!!!!
d_ex_library_01_98,Yeah! That's the one!
d_ex_library_01_99,...
d_ex_library_01_100,...
d_ex_library_01_101,Let's get out of here. Now.
d_ex_library_01_102,Good idea.
d_ex_library_02_title,Emma's Tarot Cards
d_ex_library_02_1,Zing-
d_ex_library_02_2,Anyone can see those are bad cards! You're so mean!
d_ex_library_02_3,Signal!
d_ex_library_02_4,???
d_ex_library_02_5,"Just as I'm about to head inside the library,"
d_ex_library_02_6,Signal comes running out crying.
d_ex_library_02_7,What's wrong?
d_ex_library_02_8,Commander? What brings you here?
d_ex_library_02_9,I made some tarot cards.
d_ex_library_02_10,"They're much better than the last bunch, so"
d_ex_library_02_11,"I told Signal her fortune, but she stormed off in a huff."
d_ex_library_02_12,What did you see?
d_ex_library_02_13,Her love life.
d_ex_library_02_14,Was it a bad reading?
d_ex_library_02_15,I tried to soften the blow...
d_ex_library_02_16,but Signal still took it pretty hard.
d_ex_library_02_17,Have you ever had your fortune told?
d_ex_library_02_18,Never.
d_ex_library_02_19,Want to give it a try?
d_ex_library_02_20,"I haven't quite perfected it, but it's pretty accurate."
d_ex_library_02_21,I'm sure you'll get a kick out of it.
d_ex_library_02_22,Okay.
d_ex_library_02_23,"Let's start off easy with, say... your near future?"
d_ex_library_02_24,Emma spreads out several cards onto the table.
d_ex_library_02_25,Now close your eyes...
d_ex_library_02_26,Think of a question in your head.
d_ex_library_02_27,Now pick whichever card stands out to you.
d_ex_library_02_28,... This one.
d_ex_library_02_29,That card emanates a positive energy.
d_ex_library_02_30,"Let's take a look, shall we?"
d_ex_library_02_31,Oh my.
d_ex_library_02_32,Rose in the Dark.
d_ex_library_02_33,Is that bad?
d_ex_library_02_34,"Well... not necessarily, but..."
d_ex_library_02_35,It's typically a negative card due to its connotation with death.
d_ex_library_02_36,So I'm going to die?
d_ex_library_02_37,N-no! Nothing that serious!
d_ex_library_02_38,"It can also mean periods of unhappiness or transition, but"
d_ex_library_02_39,it can also have a good meaning.
d_ex_library_02_40,Have you ever noticed how ancient medieval flags often have white roses painted on them?
d_ex_library_02_41,They signify the resurrection.
d_ex_library_02_42,"Think of it this way. After a period of great turmoil, a new future awaits."
d_ex_library_02_43,"Still, I think it's best you be extra careful for the next few days. Just in case."
d_ex_library_02_44,"Anyway, this is all just for fun."
d_ex_library_02_45,Don't take it too seriously.
d_ex_library_02_46,"Hehehe... all right, let's move on..."
d_ex_library_02_47,You seem unsettled.
d_ex_library_02_48,Really?
d_ex_library_02_49,"I-it's just hot in here, that's all."
d_ex_library_02_50,What part of your fortune would you like me to tell you?
d_ex_library_02_51,Love
d_ex_library_02_52,Money
d_ex_library_02_53,I didn't expect that from you!
d_ex_library_02_54,Someone been on your mind lately?
d_ex_library_02_55,"All right, let's take a look at"
d_ex_library_02_56,your future love life.
d_ex_library_02_57,"Think of a question, then pick a card."
d_ex_library_02_58,"Money trumps love, then?"
d_ex_library_02_59,I'm not sure if that's good or bad...
d_ex_library_02_60,"All right, let's take a look at"
d_ex_library_02_61,what your fortune holds in store for you money-wise.
d_ex_library_02_62,"Think of a question, then pick a card."
d_ex_library_02_63,That one.
d_ex_library_02_64,Let's see what we ended up with.
d_ex_library_02_65,"I guarantee you'll get a good card this time, so don't worry!"
d_ex_library_02_66,"While turning over the first card, Emma accidentally drops a card she was holding."
d_ex_library_02_67,*Thud*
d_ex_library_02_68,Oh my. Reverse...
d_ex_library_02_69,But you dropped that one...
d_ex_library_02_70,Why Reverse of all things...?
d_ex_library_02_71,"Well, Reverse isn't necessarily all bad either..."
d_ex_library_02_72,!!
d_ex_library_02_73,Dagger!
d_ex_library_02_74,Someone with a knife stuck in their back...
d_ex_library_02_75,What is wrong with these cards today?
d_ex_library_02_76,"First Rose in the Dark, then Reverse..."
d_ex_library_02_77,Reverse only showed up because of you...
d_ex_library_02_78,"Don't worry, Commander, it's not all doom and gloom."
d_ex_library_02_79,"I'm slightly worried about the Reverse, but..."
d_ex_library_02_80,"Anyway, let me turn over the last card."
d_ex_library_02_81,"Emma turns over the card, a grim look on her face."
d_ex_library_02_82,Dance with the Devil?
d_ex_library_02_83,It's been nothing but bad cards.
d_ex_library_02_84,"N-no, Commander! These cards don't necessarily mean back luck."
d_ex_library_02_85,"If you think about it positively,"
d_ex_library_02_86,maybe you'll have a big party soon?
d_ex_library_02_87,"Hehe, see? No problem here!"
d_ex_library_02_88,Don't worry about it.
d_ex_library_02_89,Never was.
d_ex_library_02_90,Y-yeah? Well that's a relief...
d_ex_library_02_91,I think we should stop there for today.
d_ex_library_02_92,Emma seems rattled as she quickly brings the fortune-telling to an end.
d_ex_library_02_93,I can understand why Signal left crying.
d_ex_library_03_title,Library Romance
d_ex_library_03_1,I've been coming to the library to read for some time now.
d_ex_library_03_2,"As I was contemplating what to read, I ran into Pepper."
d_ex_library_03_3,Hmm?
d_ex_library_03_4,"Oh, hi Commander!"
d_ex_library_03_5,Fancy running into you here!
d_ex_library_03_6,"Hi, Pepper. What brings you to the library?"
d_ex_library_03_7,I'm here to go over some medical books.
d_ex_library_03_8,"After all, acquiring knowledge is a never-ending process, right?"
d_ex_library_03_9,But...
d_ex_library_03_10,Is something wrong?
d_ex_library_03_11,"I found a book that I wanted, but it's way high up on the shelf."
d_ex_library_03_12,Pepper stands up on her toes and reaches for the book.
d_ex_library_03_13,Urgh...
d_ex_library_03_14,Just a little more and I think I could reach it!
d_ex_library_03_15,Help.
d_ex_library_03_16,Watch.
d_ex_library_03_17,I walk over to Pepper.
d_ex_library_03_18,Hey!
d_ex_library_03_19,Is this the book you're talking about?
d_ex_library_03_20,That's the one!
d_ex_library_03_21,Thanks!
d_ex_library_03_22,"Commander, you're taller than I expected."
d_ex_library_03_23,"I've got butterflies in my stomach, hehe!"
d_ex_library_03_24,Just a... little more...
d_ex_library_03_25,Yes! I got...
d_ex_library_03_26,Eeeeek!
d_ex_library_03_27,"As Pepper grasps the book in her hands, she slips toward me."
d_ex_library_03_28,*Crash*
d_ex_library_03_29,Ooof...
d_ex_library_03_30,"Commander, are you okay?!"
d_ex_library_03_31,"Sorry, I slipped!"
d_ex_library_03_32,Are you hurt? We should go to the hospital...
d_ex_library_03_33,I'm okay.
d_ex_library_03_34,But...
d_ex_library_03_35,But...?
d_ex_library_03_36,You're a little too close for comfort.
d_ex_library_03_37,Oh...!
d_ex_library_03_38,S-sorry!
d_ex_library_03_39,I'll move out of the way!
d_ex_library_03_40,A-anyways I'm glad you weren't hurt!
d_ex_library_03_41,And I got my book! Hehe.
d_ex_library_03_42,I'm planning to stay a bit and read.
d_ex_library_03_43,Are you going back now?
d_ex_library_03_44,"No, I'm going to stay and read as well."
d_ex_library_03_45,"Whoa, you're reading a medical book as well?"
d_ex_library_03_46,Are you sure it won't go over your head?
d_ex_library_03_47,My interest was sparked when I saw you with that medical book.
d_ex_library_03_48,Haha. Well good!
d_ex_library_03_49,We can read together then.
d_ex_library_03_50,I start reading with Pepper.
d_ex_library_03_51,The book is filled with medical jargon I can't understand.
d_ex_library_03_52,I can feel my eyelids getting heavier with every page.
d_ex_library_03_53,"Pretty heady stuff, isn't it?"
d_ex_library_03_54,"That book covers advanced medicine, so if you have any questions, let me know."
d_ex_library_03_55,"At this rate, you'll end up working at the hospital too. Hehe."
d_ex_library_03_56,Hey!
d_ex_library_03_57,"Commander, are you okay?!"
d_ex_library_03_58,You look exhausted...
d_ex_library_03_59,I'm so sleepy.
d_ex_library_03_60,"I'm fine, honestly."
d_ex_library_03_61,You certainly look it.
d_ex_library_03_62,Don't lie.
d_ex_library_03_63,You can barely keep your eyes open.
d_ex_library_03_64,Lie down for a bit and close your eyes.
d_ex_library_03_65,I'll wake you up in a minute.
d_ex_library_03_66,Sorry.
d_ex_library_03_67,"It's okay, I'm sure your job is tough on you. You should rest whenever you can."
d_ex_library_03_68,Your health is what's most important.
d_ex_library_03_69,Now go to sleep.
d_ex_library_03_70,"As Pepper gently strokes my hair,"
d_ex_library_03_71,I fall asleep.
d_ex_library_03_72,...
d_ex_library_03_73,...!
d_ex_library_03_74,"After waking up, Pepper is nowhere to be seen."
d_ex_library_03_75,On the desk there is a drink with a note on it. The book is gone.
d_ex_library_03_76,"Commander, I couldn't bring myself to wake you up since you were so sound asleep."
d_ex_library_03_77,"Something came up, so I have to go to the hospital."
d_ex_library_03_78,Feel free to contact me whenever you're feeling tired.
d_ex_library_03_79,Your health is the most important thing of all.
d_ex_library_03_80,See you next time.
d_ex_library_03_81,"Feeling refreshed, I grab the drink and the note, and head out of the library."
d_ex_modernbar_01_title,Dangerous Dealing
d_ex_modernbar_01_1,4 credits.
d_ex_modernbar_01_2,Haha.
d_ex_modernbar_01_3,4 credits?
d_ex_modernbar_01_4,That's 4 times what I was thinking.
d_ex_modernbar_01_5,Think again. 1 credit is plenty.
d_ex_modernbar_01_6,4 credits.
d_ex_modernbar_01_7,...
d_ex_modernbar_01_8,What are you bargaining over?
d_ex_modernbar_01_9,What are you doing?
d_ex_modernbar_01_10,"Hehe, looks like you're new to all this, Commander."
d_ex_modernbar_01_11,I'm purchasing some counterfeit civil rights chips.
d_ex_modernbar_01_12,"As you know, outlaws aren't recognized as members of the Ark."
d_ex_modernbar_01_13,"If we ever want to sneak into Royal Road or the Quotidians Residence, we need these."
d_ex_modernbar_01_14,What's wrong with you?! Why are you laying all this bare?
d_ex_modernbar_01_15,"*Gasp* Sorry, Chief!"
d_ex_modernbar_01_16,It doesn't matter. They won't say anything.
d_ex_modernbar_01_17,"By the way, Dolla..."
d_ex_modernbar_01_18,2 credits. Take it or leave it.
d_ex_modernbar_01_19,That's twice my previous offer!
d_ex_modernbar_01_20,You snagged that chip off a corpse
d_ex_modernbar_01_21,and only got it up and running after a hard reset.
d_ex_modernbar_01_22,That thing's hot. It'll never fetch a high price.
d_ex_modernbar_01_23,You'd be lucky to find a buyer in the first place.
d_ex_modernbar_01_24,4 credits.
d_ex_modernbar_01_25,"Ughh, Chief!"
d_ex_modernbar_01_26,Is she deaf or what?
d_ex_modernbar_01_27,Well...
d_ex_modernbar_01_28,What?
d_ex_modernbar_01_29,"Well, spit it out!"
d_ex_modernbar_01_30,Chip trading is illegal.
d_ex_modernbar_01_31,Should you really be doing all this right in front of me?
d_ex_modernbar_01_32,And what business is that of yours?
d_ex_modernbar_01_33,Why not?
d_ex_modernbar_01_34,You're a customer like everyone else. Just look the other way.
d_ex_modernbar_01_35,Just like she said.
d_ex_modernbar_01_36,By the way.
d_ex_modernbar_01_37,Unless you want to incur Heavenly Ascension's wrath.
d_ex_modernbar_01_38,You better take my offer.
d_ex_modernbar_01_39,"But, considering I haven't seen you in a while, I'll give you 3 credits."
d_ex_modernbar_01_40,You call that haggling?
d_ex_modernbar_01_41,...
d_ex_modernbar_01_42,4 credits.
d_ex_modernbar_01_43,*Click*
d_ex_modernbar_01_44,"Chief,"
d_ex_modernbar_01_45,"just give me the order, and I'll pull the trigger."
d_ex_modernbar_01_46,*Sigh*
d_ex_modernbar_01_47,"Sure, go ahead."
d_ex_modernbar_01_48,I can always find another seller.
d_ex_modernbar_01_49,Wait!
d_ex_modernbar_01_50,What?
d_ex_modernbar_01_51,Put your gun down!
d_ex_modernbar_01_52,Why should I?
d_ex_modernbar_01_53,Shooting me only hurts you.
d_ex_modernbar_01_54,Do you really think you can find another seller just like that?
d_ex_modernbar_01_55,Everyone on the outside is scheming.
d_ex_modernbar_01_56,"They plant GPS systems in fake chips, then you end up in jail"
d_ex_modernbar_01_57,while they collect a fat reward.
d_ex_modernbar_01_58,Don't act like you don't know about this.
d_ex_modernbar_01_59,Of course I know that.
d_ex_modernbar_01_60,"So what? That's all a minor annoyance, nothing more."
d_ex_modernbar_01_61,That doesn't mean whoever I want to kill gets a pass.
d_ex_modernbar_01_62,"Listen to me, please..."
d_ex_modernbar_01_63,Stay out of the way.
d_ex_modernbar_01_64,"By the way, Crow..."
d_ex_modernbar_01_65,One of our snipers has a bead on you from outside the window.
d_ex_modernbar_01_66,"If any of your underlings opens fire, they'll turn your head into pulp."
d_ex_modernbar_01_67,"Both of you, stop! Please!"
d_ex_modernbar_01_68,I'll pay the difference!
d_ex_modernbar_01_69,!!
d_ex_modernbar_01_70,!!
d_ex_modernbar_01_71,"3 credits from Crow, so..."
d_ex_modernbar_01_72,you'll pay the remaining 1 credit. Is that right?
d_ex_modernbar_01_73,Yes.
d_ex_modernbar_01_74,... All right. I see no reason to refuse.
d_ex_modernbar_01_75,"The counterfeit civilian chips are yours, all 73 of them. Don't forget to put the money in my account as soon as possible."
d_ex_modernbar_01_76,Within 3 days is all right with you?
d_ex_modernbar_01_77,That'll be fine.
d_ex_modernbar_01_78,It's a deal then.
d_ex_modernbar_01_79,"You drive a tough bargain, but you're good, that much I can say."
d_ex_modernbar_01_80,"Right back at you. Pleasure doing business with you, as always."
d_ex_modernbar_01_81,"Well, I've got to get a move on. See you around."
d_ex_modernbar_01_82,...
d_ex_modernbar_01_83,"Thanks for the help, Commander!"
d_ex_modernbar_01_84,"Yes, thanks for helping seal the deal."
d_ex_modernbar_01_85,"Ah, by the way."
d_ex_modernbar_01_86,The price we were discussing was per megabyte.
d_ex_modernbar_01_87,So each chip may set you back a bit.
d_ex_modernbar_01_88,You can discuss the details with Dolla.
d_ex_modernbar_01_89,See ya.
d_ex_modernbar_01_90,...
d_ex_modernbar_01_91,Somehow...
d_ex_modernbar_01_92,I feel like I've been swindled.
d_ex_modernbar_02_title,A Melancholy Night
d_ex_modernbar_02_1,*Clink*
d_ex_modernbar_02_2,"Ah, there you are M'Lord!"
d_ex_modernbar_02_3,"Mine eyes doth witness a most peculiar sight, one which begged to be shared."
d_ex_modernbar_02_4,Gaze upon these fine maidens.
d_ex_modernbar_02_5,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_6,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_7,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_8,What is this...
d_ex_modernbar_02_9,"More than an hour's time has passed since their gathering, and yet not a word has been shared amongst them!"
d_ex_modernbar_02_10,Everyone is merely focused on imbibing the spirits which lay before them.
d_ex_modernbar_02_11,There is something else that tickles one's funny bone...
d_ex_modernbar_02_12,"Before my arrival, these maidens were all downing their potations by their lonesome!"
d_ex_modernbar_02_13,A few hours ago.
d_ex_modernbar_02_14,Brid abruptly puts down her glass.
d_ex_modernbar_02_15,*Clank*
d_ex_modernbar_02_16,Hah...
d_ex_modernbar_02_17,Haaaah...
d_ex_modernbar_02_18,???
d_ex_modernbar_02_19,Brid turns her head to the seat beside her.
d_ex_modernbar_02_20,Her eyes meet with Yulha.
d_ex_modernbar_02_21,"Honey, you're..."
d_ex_modernbar_02_22,You...
d_ex_modernbar_02_23,Haaaaah...
d_ex_modernbar_02_24,What is that?
d_ex_modernbar_02_25,Yulha turns her head to the seat beside her.
d_ex_modernbar_02_26,Her eyes meet with Mana.
d_ex_modernbar_02_27,What are you...
d_ex_modernbar_02_28,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_modernbar_02_29,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_30,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_31,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_32,"Since we're all here, why don't we drink together?"
d_ex_modernbar_02_33,Better than the three of us drowning our sorrows all alone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_34,... Sure.
d_ex_modernbar_02_35,Should we move to a round table?
d_ex_modernbar_02_36,Back to the present.
d_ex_modernbar_02_37,You mean they've been drinking like that since?
d_ex_modernbar_02_38,That's right!
d_ex_modernbar_02_39,"Despite my presence at the scene from the very beginning, they all paid me no mind. They were too lost in their own thoughts."
d_ex_modernbar_02_40,That's why you guys weren't drinking together.
d_ex_modernbar_02_41,"You truly are the sharpest of wicks, M'Lord."
d_ex_modernbar_02_42,I was merely curious as to how long they could continue ingesting such amounts.
d_ex_modernbar_02_43,"I get it, but..."
d_ex_modernbar_02_44,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_45,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_46,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_47,*Beep*
d_ex_modernbar_02_48,The three flinched at the same time.
d_ex_modernbar_02_49,I don't think it's my phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_50,Me neither.
d_ex_modernbar_02_51,... It's mine.
d_ex_modernbar_02_52,Yulha answers her phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_53,What.
d_ex_modernbar_02_54,Loud noises come from Yulha's phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_55,"Why are you yelling...! Privaty, calm down and pull yourself together. You're not making sense."
d_ex_modernbar_02_56,What did they do this time?
d_ex_modernbar_02_57,What?! Reduce the budget... they're cra...
d_ex_modernbar_02_58,Hah... Forget it. Probably just trying to get on our nerves.
d_ex_modernbar_02_59,I'll take care of it first thing tomorrow. Don't worry about it and just go to sleep.
d_ex_modernbar_02_60,Yulha hangs up the phone. Her annoyance is clear.
d_ex_modernbar_02_61,Haaaah...
d_ex_modernbar_02_62,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_63,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_64,"Without saying a word, Brid fills Yulha's glass."
d_ex_modernbar_02_65,... Thanks.
d_ex_modernbar_02_66,Yulha takes a swig.
d_ex_modernbar_02_67,*Beep*
d_ex_modernbar_02_68,!!
d_ex_modernbar_02_69,!!
d_ex_modernbar_02_70,... It's me this time.
d_ex_modernbar_02_71,Brid answers her phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_72,Yes. Speaking.
d_ex_modernbar_02_73,Loud noises come from Brid's phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_74,Soline got into an accident again... I see. I'll tell her to be more careful.
d_ex_modernbar_02_75,Yes. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Yes. I'm...
d_ex_modernbar_02_76,I can hear the other end hang up.
d_ex_modernbar_02_77,... Sorry.
d_ex_modernbar_02_78,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_79,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_80,"Without saying a word, Mana fills Brid's glass."
d_ex_modernbar_02_81,Thanks...
d_ex_modernbar_02_82,Brid takes a swig.
d_ex_modernbar_02_83,*Beep*
d_ex_modernbar_02_84,!!
d_ex_modernbar_02_85,Yulha and Brid stare at Mana.
d_ex_modernbar_02_86,Looks like it's my turn.
d_ex_modernbar_02_87,Mana answers her phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_88,Yes... Speak...
d_ex_modernbar_02_89,There's a sound coming from the phone.
d_ex_modernbar_02_90,"Hey, what are you doing?! Where are you?!"
d_ex_modernbar_02_91,Where's that research report you said you'd give me?!
d_ex_modernbar_02_92,"Uh... Syuen, I believe that report is due next week."
d_ex_modernbar_02_93,You expect me to wait an entire week? I want it on my desk tomorrow!
d_ex_modernbar_02_94,That's not even possible...
d_ex_modernbar_02_95,I don't care! Do what you have to do!
d_ex_modernbar_02_96,I can hear the other end hang up.
d_ex_modernbar_02_97,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_98,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_99,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_100,"Without saying a word, Yulha fills Mana's glass."
d_ex_modernbar_02_101,Thanks...
d_ex_modernbar_02_102,Mana takes a swig.
d_ex_modernbar_02_103,Life sure is tough...
d_ex_modernbar_02_104,I hear you.
d_ex_modernbar_02_105,Haaaah...
d_ex_modernbar_02_106,All three fill their glasses and continue drinking silently.
d_ex_modernbar_02_107,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_108,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_109,Most unfortunate indeed.
d_ex_modernbar_02_110,"I originally intended on joining their party, but on second thought, I may refrain from doing so."
d_ex_modernbar_02_111,Haha... poor unfortunate souls.
d_ex_modernbar_02_112,This is precisely why it is best to live one's life free from all earthly ties.
d_ex_modernbar_02_113,Wouldn't you agree?
d_ex_modernbar_02_114,I'm an employee myself.
d_ex_modernbar_02_115,"That's right! You work under the Central Government, do you not? I almost forgot."
d_ex_modernbar_02_116,"Well, that's one more unfortunate soul I suppose!"
d_ex_modernbar_02_117,"Here, drink up."
d_ex_modernbar_02_118,Scarlet hands me a glass.
d_ex_modernbar_02_119,...
d_ex_modernbar_02_120,I drink from the glass.
d_ex_modernbar_02_121,It tastes... full of life.
d_ex_modernbar_02_122,Haaaah...
d_ex_modernbar_03_title,No More Tests
d_ex_modernbar_03_1,I can't remember the last time I got well and truly drunk.
d_ex_modernbar_03_2,"My stomach is in knots, and the room is spinning."

d_ex_modernbar_03_4,Urp...
d_ex_modernbar_03_5,Believer.
d_ex_modernbar_03_6,Ugh...
d_ex_modernbar_03_7,Believer!
d_ex_modernbar_03_8,... Rapunzel?
d_ex_modernbar_03_9,Rapun...
d_ex_modernbar_03_10,"Yes, it's me."
d_ex_modernbar_03_11,Are you all right?
d_ex_modernbar_03_12,"No, I'm not."
d_ex_modernbar_03_13,I can tell.
d_ex_modernbar_03_14,Why did you drink so much by yourself?
d_ex_modernbar_03_15,Felt like it.
d_ex_modernbar_03_16,Is there anything bothering you?
d_ex_modernbar_03_17,No.
d_ex_modernbar_03_18,Yes.
d_ex_modernbar_03_19,"Well, that's good. As long as nothing bad has happened..."
d_ex_modernbar_03_20,Although I don't know what led to you ending up like this...
d_ex_modernbar_03_21,...
d_ex_modernbar_03_22,don't you think this is a bit excessive?
d_ex_modernbar_03_23,You're a major liability now!
d_ex_modernbar_03_24,"I swear, sometimes I feel you're doing this to me on purpose..."
d_ex_modernbar_03_25,You're incredibly vulnerable now! If I were to... with you...
d_ex_modernbar_03_26,Then we'd... and then...
d_ex_modernbar_03_27,"Oh yes, give it to me!"
d_ex_modernbar_03_28,... Rapunzel?
d_ex_modernbar_03_29,Oh! Wha... is someone calling me?
d_ex_modernbar_03_30,What were you thinking about just now?
d_ex_modernbar_03_31,No... Nothing!
d_ex_modernbar_03_32,I was just wondering what it'd be like to be with you alone and doing this... and that...
d_ex_modernbar_03_33,Let's do it then.
d_ex_modernbar_03_34,Huh?
d_ex_modernbar_03_35,Are you sure you know what I had in mind?
d_ex_modernbar_03_36,... Aaaah!
d_ex_modernbar_03_37,"No, no! I must rid my mind of these sinful delusions."
d_ex_modernbar_03_38,"You're so plastered, that you've lost control of your faculties."
d_ex_modernbar_03_39,"Here, I'll hold you up..."
d_ex_modernbar_03_40,Rapun... zel...
d_ex_modernbar_03_41,"My head feels like it weighs a ton, so I put it on Rapunzel's shoulder."
d_ex_modernbar_03_42,!!!
d_ex_modernbar_03_43,Can someone give me a hand here?!
d_ex_modernbar_03_44,*Jingle*
d_ex_modernbar_03_45,Let's see...
d_ex_modernbar_03_46,"All this cocktail needs are a few sugar cubes, then it'll be perfect!"
d_ex_modernbar_03_47,"Hey, you!"
d_ex_modernbar_03_48,Huh?
d_ex_modernbar_03_49,The Believer drank so much that he can barely walk.
d_ex_modernbar_03_50,Can you lend me a hand?
d_ex_modernbar_03_51,Believer?
d_ex_modernbar_03_52,Don't you mean Partner?
d_ex_modernbar_03_53,What's Partner doing so drunk?
d_ex_modernbar_03_54,Su... Su... Sugar.

d_ex_modernbar_03_56,"Aw, you poor thing."
d_ex_modernbar_03_57,Why can't you just carry this booze bag home?
d_ex_modernbar_03_58,That shouldn't be a big deal for you.
d_ex_modernbar_03_59,"I'm afraid if I get any closer, I won't be able to control myself. I may end up doing something... scandalous."
d_ex_modernbar_03_60,"Please, have mercy and help me."
d_ex_modernbar_03_61,*Sigh* Doesn't sound like I have much of a choice.
d_ex_modernbar_03_62,I'll bring Black Typhoon around and take this poor sap home.
d_ex_modernbar_03_63,Th... Thanks...
d_ex_modernbar_03_64,"Sugar lifts me up, and I suddenly feel sick."
d_ex_modernbar_03_65,*Retching noises*
d_ex_modernbar_03_66,Don't even think about spewing on Black Typhoon!
d_ex_modernbar_03_67,"I don't care what you have to do, just hold it in!"
d_ex_modernbar_03_68,Will I ever have a day free of temptation...?
d_ex_modernbar_03_69,"Still, at least I got Believer out of a tight spot..."
d_ex_modernbar_03_70,...
d_ex_modernbar_03_71,"As the sound of Rapunzel's voice fades away, I blackout."

d_ex_mysteryclub_01_2,"Oh, welcome, Commander!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_3,Welcome!
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_4,Can I order something?
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_5,"Sure, of course!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_6,"Our shop is small, but we have everything, just tell us what you need."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_7,Then...
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_8,"Say, Mihara."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_9,"Come to think of it, we might have used up all the ingredients."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_10,Eh? Is that true?
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_11,Yeah! Yuni will go get some.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_12,"Yes, please."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_13,Yuni runs out to get ingredients.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_14,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_15,Commander.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_16,What do you think of a girl carrying heavy weights?
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_17,I think that's impressive.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_18,... I'd help her out.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_19,"Impressive, right?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_20,But I think it'd be more impressive if a powerful leader were to lend a hand to children in need.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_21,... I'd help her out.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_22,"Hehe, thank you so much."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_23,I head to the place where I saw Yuni disappear.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_24,The door opens.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_25,"Behind the door, it's the stairs to the basement."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_26,"The light is dark, I can't see clearly the walls and ceiling downstairs."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_27,I walk down to check.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_28,The sound of rustling is coming from downstairs.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_29,Eh... this one?
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_30,"Maybe not. Commander is new here, maybe something softer."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_31,"Hehe, I'm so considerate."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_32,... I feel a sense of foreboding.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_33,Ouch.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_34,"It's so dark down here.
Is this the... light switch?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_35,*Click* The light of the basement turns on.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_36,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_37,"In the red light, there's a lot of weird equipment hanging on the wall."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_38,"All kinds of handcuffs, whips,
and leather accessories."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_39,... Is this the...
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_40,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_41,No.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_42,I need to get out of this place.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_43,"Ah, you have seen them."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_44,!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_45,Hehe. What are you doing here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_46,Go help Yuni now.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_47,There's an emergency. I've got to go.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_48,Someone's grabbing me.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_49,... Yuni grabs me by my arm from behind.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_50,"Hehe, I'm afraid not. You have to help me first."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_51,"Hehe, let me help you too."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_52,"Worry not, Commander."
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_53,We are professionals.
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_54,*Bang*
d_ex_mysteryclub_01_55,The door of the basement closes tight.

d_ex_mysteryclub_02_3,The door is not locked. I guess it's open for business now.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_4,Do we have to go here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_5,"Yes! Judging by its appearance, I can tell that this shop is for adults only."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_6,I will be their new loyal customer!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_7,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_8,"There you are, Commander."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_9,"My my, you even brought a cute companion with you today."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_10,"Hehe. Welcome, Soline."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_11,Have a seat.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_12,What do you sell here? Why is it so dark?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_13,We sell anything that a customer could imagine.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_14,"Clothes, equipment, drinks, perfumes..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_15,What's Soline here for?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_16,Well... I don't have anything specific in mind.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_17,"But, I want to be your loyal customer. So how about we start with some drinks?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_18,Let me get you the menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_19,"Commander, can you hand me the menu over there?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_20,Give her the black menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_21,Give her the white menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_22,"Ah, not that one."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_23,Soline is new here. It would be better if we served her something pure.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_24,Give her the white menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_25,Thanks.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_26,Soline opens the menu and reads.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_27,Huh...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_28,I can't imagine the taste just by reading from the menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_29,"What do you recommend, Commander?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_30,Take the menu from Soline and read.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_31,"Shuddering Icy Lemonade, Painful Cappuccino..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_32,"It's hard to imagine how they'll taste, but they all seem rather foreboding."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_33,"If you have any questions, you can ask me anything."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_34,Yuni is at your service.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_35,What do the names mean?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_36,How do the drinks taste?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_37,"Hehe, that's the purpose of the drink."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_38,"With just a little sip, you will experience that feeling a hundred times more."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_39,What Yuni likes the most is the Thrilling Cherry Juice.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_40,"Drink it up, and your finger will feel..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_41,That's enough. No need to continue.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_42,Er... I still don't get it even after that explanation.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_43,Do you have anything more normal?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_44,This is super bitter
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_45,because we focus on the effect more that the taste.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_46,"Hehe... By the way, what Yuni likes the most is the Thrilling Cherry Juice."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_47,"Drink it up, and your finger will feel..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_48,That's enough.  You don't have to continue.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_49,"Although I don't hate the bitter taste,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_50,do you have something sweeter than this?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_51,Ah! Remember the other menu?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_52,"Oh my, that menu is..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_53,Soline fetches the black menu.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_54,"Gee, aren't they all supposed to be good?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_55,"Well, I will have..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_56,Yuni's Private Sweet Special.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_57,This looks nice!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_58,...!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_59,Ah...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_60,Soline ordered Yuni's special.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_61,Yuni will do my best to serve you.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_62,"Eh... no need for that, just do it how you normally do it."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_63,"Ah, Yuni is excited."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_64,"Okay, I will just do it as usual."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_65,Yuni takes out a whip from beneath the bar counter.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_66,"Yep, as usual..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_67,"Wait, what's that whip for?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_68,It's the most important ingredient.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_69,The most important ingredient?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_70,Do you use a whip to mix the drinks?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_71,Yuni's special should be tasted in the basement.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_72,"... It's for mixing drinks, right?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_73,Let's go down there together.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_74,W-wait!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_75,"If this continues, Soline will be taken to the basement."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_76,I have to stop Yuni.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_77,I suddenly get a stomach ache...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_78,I suddenly feel dizzy...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_79,I wink to Soline while clutching my stomach.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_80,I wink to Soline while covering my mouth.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_81,Ah...
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_82,"Oh my. Are you all right, Commander?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_83,Commander?
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_84,I feel really sick.
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_85,I need to take you to the hospital immediately!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_86,It... it looks like the special menu can wait!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_87,"Oh, dear! I'm afraid this is it."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_88,"Soline, please take care of Commander."
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_89,What a pity! Be sure to come again!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_90,I will give you a discount!
d_ex_mysteryclub_02_91,"Yuni is left behind, looking a bit sad. Escorted by Soline, we leave the Club in a rush."

d_ex_mysteryclub_03_3,It's so dark in here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_4,Who's there?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_5,A suspicious club.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_6,Are you sure you're in the right place?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_7,"Boss, you're here too?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_8,I'm on a business trip!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_9,I followed the directions exactly!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_10,Hey Centi.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_11,How come you're here and not Liter?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_12,Hey.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_13,"Liter already had her hands full, so I came instead."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_14,"You did call for me, didn't you?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_15,We sure did.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_16,"Okay, just wanted to make sure."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_17,Is this where I'll be working?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_18,That may be a little difficult. It's pitch black in here!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_19,I won't be able to tell my hand from a hole in the ground.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_20,"Oh no, that won't do!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_21,You can work in the basement. I'll show you the way.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_22,"Finally, a new toy!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_23,"Hurry, hurry."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_24,Everyone goes down into the basement together.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_25,Squeak-
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_26,It's here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_27,"Hehe, my heart pounds every time I open this door."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_28,Wow!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_29,Most of them are tools I've never seen before!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_30,This is very interesting!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_31,"If you're interested, would you like to play with Yuni later?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_32,Sure! But I've got to get my work done first.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_33,I had a look at your purchase order.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_34,I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to be used for...
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_35,But it's certainly a very intriguing chair!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_36,"Heck, I'm not even sure if it even is a chair."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_37,"Anyway, I'll get started."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_38,Centi gets to work using the materials she brought with her.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_39,*Jiiing*
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_40,"Wow, what is that?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_41,"It's sparkling, and it digs in..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_42,I want it.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_43,That will be a fine choice for my next toy.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_44,Yes. Very good.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_45,Bang! Bang! Bang!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_46,I always love the sound of hammer strikes.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_47,It's a different sound compared to Liter.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_48,Centi must be really strong.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_49,Yes. I want to play with Centi.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_50,Phew~
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_51,"Sorry, do you have anything to drink?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_52,It's like a sauna in here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_53,"We don't have any water, but we've got some soda."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_54,Would that be okay?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_55,"Sure, anything is fine!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_56,...!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_57,"All right, coming right up."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_58,I'll go with you.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_59,Mihara and Yuni head upstairs.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_60,Wouldn't water be better?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_61,I'll go out and buy some.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_62,No! I actually prefer soda!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_63,"Besides, I'm curious what they'll end up giving me."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_64,"Curiosity killed the cat, you know."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_65,What's the problem?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_66,This place is so interesting. There are all sorts of things I haven't seen before.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_67,"I'm curious about everything here, beverages included!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_68,You may end up regretting that...
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_69,Why are you talking like that?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_70,"While trying to talk sense into Centi, Mihara comes down with three different colored beverages."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_71,"The Commander doesn't drink,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_72,so we just brought enough for the three of us.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_73,Which one do you want to drink?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_74,Any of them is fine.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_75,The Commander seems to know more than me about this kind of thing. I'll have the Commander choose for me.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_76,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_77,Yellow.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_78,Red.

d_ex_mysteryclub_03_83,It's called Lusty Lemonade.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_84,Lusty Lemonade!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_85,What an intriguing name!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_86,"Anyway, now that I'm hydrated, gotta get back to work."

d_ex_mysteryclub_03_88,...!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_89,Wh-what's happening?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_90,What's wrong?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_91,There's this tingling sensation in my fingertips!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_92,It feels like my sense of touch has been enhanced. I can almost feel the vibrations of everything around me.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_93,Have I... ascended to another realm?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_94,Bottom's up!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_95,*Gulp gulp*
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_96,"Wow, this is delicious!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_97,What is this?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_98,It's called Sultry Strawberry.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_99,Sultry Strawberry!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_100,Just the name alone is enough to get you excited!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_101,"Anyway, now that I'm hydrated, gotta get back to work."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_102,Jiiiiiing-
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_103,...!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_104,Wh-what's happening?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_105,What's wrong?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_106,I feel really... excited!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_107,"Feels like I'm out of breath, and it's like everything is razor focused!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_108,Is this what they call the throes of passion?
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_109,This is the first time I've ever felt this way. Can't stop now!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_110,Centi finishes the job with insane speed.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_111,Whew...
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_112,I was really in the zone back there.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_113,You finished the new toy in no time!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_114,"Thank you, Centi. Now let's play."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_115,...!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_116,I think Centi is too tired to play right now.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_117,"That's true, I'm not sure my body can take any more stimulation."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_118,I'm sorry.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_119,Oh... that's too bad.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_120,"Regardless, thanks for finishing it so quickly."
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_121,No need to thank me. Just doing my job!
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_122,I should be the one thanking you for that drink. It feels like I've gained an entirely new realm of senses...
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_123,"If I ever have another big project or a lengthy business trip, would I be able to buy some from you?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_124,Of course! You're always welcome here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_125,And we must play next time.
d_ex_mysteryclub_03_126,Sure thing!

d_ex_observationpost_01_4,Have you seen the other squad buildings? They've had guests over. It's so lively.
d_ex_observationpost_01_5,"While we... well,"
d_ex_observationpost_01_6,there's a gap between us and other Nikkes.
d_ex_observationpost_01_7,...
d_ex_observationpost_01_8,"Signal, you can go out and have some fun if you are bored."
d_ex_observationpost_01_9,"No, it's not that! I'm not saying that I'm bored..."
d_ex_observationpost_01_10,*Knock knock*
d_ex_observationpost_01_11,Excuse me... is anyone inside?
d_ex_observationpost_01_12,A... a guest!
d_ex_observationpost_01_13,Please come in!
d_ex_observationpost_01_14,Julia opens the door and steps in.
d_ex_observationpost_01_15,I was told I could see the surface from a high up place like this. Like an eagle in the sky.
d_ex_observationpost_01_16,Is that true?
d_ex_observationpost_01_17,Sky? Eagle? What are you...
d_ex_observationpost_01_18,"Yes, yes! You are right. This is the place to see the surface."
d_ex_observationpost_01_19,So... how can we help you?
d_ex_observationpost_01_20,"Ah, well..."
d_ex_observationpost_01_21,I lost something important while I was traveling on the surface following the guidance of music.
d_ex_observationpost_01_22,I'm here to see if I can find it.
d_ex_observationpost_01_23,I think you got it wrong. This is not a lost and found office.
d_ex_observationpost_01_24,"Ah, I see. Sorry, I came to the wrong place."
d_ex_observationpost_01_25,How... how did you lose it?
d_ex_observationpost_01_26,... Signal.
d_ex_observationpost_01_27,S-sorry.
d_ex_observationpost_01_28,But... maybe we can find it for her.
d_ex_observationpost_01_29,Could you please tell us what you lost?
d_ex_observationpost_01_30,... Fine.
d_ex_observationpost_01_31,So what's this important thing?
d_ex_observationpost_01_32,I lost... my soul.
d_ex_observationpost_01_33,!!
d_ex_observationpost_01_34,Y-your soul?
d_ex_observationpost_01_35,"Yes, that's what I lost."
d_ex_observationpost_01_36,B-but we can't observe souls...
d_ex_observationpost_01_37,What should we do?
d_ex_observationpost_01_38,Where did you lose it?
d_ex_observationpost_01_39,"Well... While I was in front of the Surface Elevator,

just before I made up my mind to see Conductor,"
d_ex_observationpost_01_40,it was in my hands.
d_ex_observationpost_01_41,In your hands?
d_ex_observationpost_01_42,"This ""soul"" you are talking about, is it an object?"
d_ex_observationpost_01_43,"Yes, it's a music sheet with my soul in it."
d_ex_observationpost_01_44,Ah. A music sheet! That's a relief.
d_ex_observationpost_01_45,I don't think so...
d_ex_observationpost_01_46,Our observation device can't search for things like that.
d_ex_observationpost_01_47,B-but...
d_ex_observationpost_01_48,"I won't stop you if you want to search for that, Signal."
d_ex_observationpost_01_49,But count me out. I don't want to waste my time on something impossible.
d_ex_observationpost_01_50,Ah... I'm so sorry.
d_ex_observationpost_01_51,"So what will you do, Signal?"
d_ex_observationpost_01_52,I... I want to try. Even if it's just for a bit.
d_ex_observationpost_01_53,"After all, it's the request of our guest who came to our Observatory."
d_ex_observationpost_01_54,... All right then.
d_ex_observationpost_01_55,Do what you want. I have a mission to go to.
d_ex_observationpost_01_56,"Ah, okay! Take care!"
d_ex_observationpost_01_57,Delta leaves.
d_ex_observationpost_01_58,"Well, I will try to find it from here first!"
d_ex_observationpost_01_59,Maybe I can see the music sheet.
d_ex_observationpost_01_60,Ah... thank you.
d_ex_observationpost_01_61,Signal operates the Surface Observation Device to look around.
d_ex_observationpost_01_62,30 minutes later.
d_ex_observationpost_01_63,Are... Are your eyes hurting?
d_ex_observationpost_01_64,Just leave it. It's okay if you can't find it.
d_ex_observationpost_01_65,No! Let me try a little longer.
d_ex_observationpost_01_66,One hour later.
d_ex_observationpost_01_67,I think I should go find it myself...
d_ex_observationpost_01_68,W-wait! Just a little longer!
d_ex_observationpost_01_69,Two hours later.
d_ex_observationpost_01_70,...
d_ex_observationpost_01_71,Excuse me... are you all right?
d_ex_observationpost_01_72,"... Sorry, I can't find it."
d_ex_observationpost_01_73,I was so stubborn and I just wasted your time. I'm so sorry.
d_ex_observationpost_01_74,It's okay. Don't worry.
d_ex_observationpost_01_75,Your hospitality is so touching and it warms my heart.
d_ex_observationpost_01_76,"You worked so hard and for that, I'm very grateful."
d_ex_observationpost_01_77,...
d_ex_observationpost_01_78,I guess I will return to the surface...
d_ex_observationpost_01_79,Is this the music sheet you are looking for?
d_ex_observationpost_01_80,!!
d_ex_observationpost_01_81,... Delta?
d_ex_observationpost_01_82,"Yes, that's exactly it!"
d_ex_observationpost_01_83,Where did you...
d_ex_observationpost_01_84,"On my way to the mission, I found it when I took the Surface Elevator."
d_ex_observationpost_01_85,Ah... that makes sense.
d_ex_observationpost_01_86,"While I was coming down here,"
d_ex_observationpost_01_87,I met Counters and played new music for them.
d_ex_observationpost_01_88,That must be when I lost my soul.
d_ex_observationpost_01_89,Thank you so much! How can I repay you for this...
d_ex_observationpost_01_90,I just found it accidentally.
d_ex_observationpost_01_91,It's no big deal.
d_ex_observationpost_01_92,"Oh... my savior, your generosity is as wide as the ocean on the surface."
d_ex_observationpost_01_93,"I swear, one day I will play a song for you two"
d_ex_observationpost_01_94,that is as warm and generous as your hearts.
d_ex_observationpost_01_95,"I'm really, really grateful."
d_ex_observationpost_01_96,Julia leaves with a happy smile on her face.
d_ex_observationpost_01_97,"Thank you, Delta!"
d_ex_observationpost_01_98,I thought I would never find it. You saved the day for me!
d_ex_observationpost_01_99,It was nothing.
d_ex_observationpost_01_100,"As I said, I found it by accident."
d_ex_observationpost_01_101,"Even so, what you did still deserves a big thank you!"
d_ex_observationpost_01_102,...
d_ex_observationpost_01_103,Whatever you say.
d_ex_observationpost_01_104,I'm out for the next mission.
d_ex_observationpost_01_105,Okay! Safe travels!
d_ex_observationpost_02_title,Help Needed at the Observatory
d_ex_observationpost_02_1,C-Commander!
d_ex_observationpost_02_2,Can I help you with anything?
d_ex_observationpost_02_3,I dropped by to see what the weather was like up on the surface.
d_ex_observationpost_02_4,"Oh, okay!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_5,I-I wasn't watching TV shows because I was bored...!
d_ex_observationpost_02_6,"Well, usually I'm here on my own, and..."
d_ex_observationpost_02_7,"I had some free time, so I was taking a break."
d_ex_observationpost_02_8,Do you want to come here and sit?
d_ex_observationpost_02_9,Thank you.
d_ex_observationpost_02_10,Let me check the weather for you.
d_ex_observationpost_02_11,One moment!
d_ex_observationpost_02_12,Signal begins to look around using the observer.
d_ex_observationpost_02_13,"The weather is very clear at the moment, but I see some dark clouds off in the distance."
d_ex_observationpost_02_14,Looks like it might rain in a few hours.
d_ex_observationpost_02_15,Are you going up to the surface?
d_ex_observationpost_02_16,That's right.
d_ex_observationpost_02_17,Hopefully you can wrap up your mission before it rains.
d_ex_observationpost_02_18,I've noticed you head up to the surface at the same time every week. Is this an ongoing mission?
d_ex_observationpost_02_19,How did you guess?
d_ex_observationpost_02_20,I-I didn't mean to pry!
d_ex_observationpost_02_21,"I just happen to notice it, that's all. This is an observatory, after all..."
d_ex_observationpost_02_22,"Well, actually, it wasn't all just a coincidence..."
d_ex_observationpost_02_23,Jing-
d_ex_observationpost_02_24,Hello everyone.
d_ex_observationpost_02_25,"Hi, Commander."
d_ex_observationpost_02_26,"Hey, Mary."
d_ex_observationpost_02_27,"We're counting on you today, Signal."
d_ex_observationpost_02_28,Got it!
d_ex_observationpost_02_29,"Mary, what brings you here?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_30,"Commander, you've been going out on a mission at the same time every week, haven't you?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_31,...!
d_ex_observationpost_02_32,How did you know?
d_ex_observationpost_02_33,Do you remember the day you came to the hospital when Anis had a few minor injuries?
d_ex_observationpost_02_34,"Thanks to the Scouts, we knew you'd be coming,"
d_ex_observationpost_02_35,and were able to treat you both right away.
d_ex_observationpost_02_36,"The Scouts can point out who is coming back, and also let us know who is injured."
d_ex_observationpost_02_37,Sounds like efficient teamwork.
d_ex_observationpost_02_38,"Very much so. This way, patients in critical condition can be sent back to the Ark without delay."
d_ex_observationpost_02_39,It also allows us to make preparations in advance for simpler treatments.
d_ex_observationpost_02_40,"I came here to ask for a favor, but I didn't expect you to be here."
d_ex_observationpost_02_41,"You're heading up to the surface soon, aren't you?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_42,That's right.
d_ex_observationpost_02_43,Then I'll head to the hospital and get everything ready.
d_ex_observationpost_02_44,Get in touch with me later.
d_ex_observationpost_02_45,Will do!
d_ex_observationpost_02_46,Okay.
d_ex_observationpost_02_47,Phew.
d_ex_observationpost_02_48,I feel I can relax now that she's gone...
d_ex_observationpost_02_49,You all have a good thing going here.
d_ex_observationpost_02_50,Th-thank you!
d_ex_observationpost_02_51,Delta was the one who spotted you returning from a mission.
d_ex_observationpost_02_52,"Yeah, but everything else was Signal's idea."
d_ex_observationpost_02_53,Then our squad did it!
d_ex_observationpost_02_54,...
d_ex_observationpost_02_55,Jing-
d_ex_observationpost_02_56,Hey there!
d_ex_observationpost_02_57,How have you been?
d_ex_observationpost_02_58,*Gasp*
d_ex_observationpost_02_59,Another visitor already?
d_ex_observationpost_02_60,"Signal, you can just take a seat."
d_ex_observationpost_02_61,"Uh, okay..."
d_ex_observationpost_02_62,What is the matter?
d_ex_observationpost_02_63,So this is the observatory.
d_ex_observationpost_02_64,Is it true that the villains can be easily spotted from here?
d_ex_observationpost_02_65,"By villains, do you mean Raptures?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_66,"If so, then yes, you can see nearby Raptures from here."
d_ex_observationpost_02_67,Amazing!
d_ex_observationpost_02_68,"I can first confirm the villains whereabouts, then set out!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_69,Any tasks worthy of a hero that need doing?
d_ex_observationpost_02_70,Let me check.
d_ex_observationpost_02_71,Delta moves closer to the observer and starts operating it.
d_ex_observationpost_02_72,...
d_ex_observationpost_02_73,"Laplace, I can officially confirm it..."
d_ex_observationpost_02_74,"Yes, where shall I set off to?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_75,You can just head back.
d_ex_observationpost_02_76,I don't see a single Rapture.
d_ex_observationpost_02_77,You don't?!
d_ex_observationpost_02_78,Well then! It seems peace reigns once again!
d_ex_observationpost_02_79,No doubt due to my heroic efforts.
d_ex_observationpost_02_80,"If you do happen upon a Rapture, please contact me!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_81,"I'm off, then!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_82,"Hero, out!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_83,*Shatter*
d_ex_observationpost_02_84,Laplace hurls herself through the window.
d_ex_observationpost_02_85,...
d_ex_observationpost_02_86,There sure are a lot of visitors today.
d_ex_observationpost_02_87,"Ah, look at the time!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_88,"Commander, shouldn't you be heading up to the surface soon?!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_89,I hope we didn't keep you too long.
d_ex_observationpost_02_90,"You won't be late, will you?"
d_ex_observationpost_02_91,It's okay.
d_ex_observationpost_02_92,If you say so.
d_ex_observationpost_02_93,"The next time you drop by, it may be better to come in the evening."
d_ex_observationpost_02_94,"You can use the observer to see the night sky on the surface. On a clear evening, the stars are incredible!"
d_ex_observationpost_02_95,"Yeah, she's right."
d_ex_observationpost_02_96,...
d_ex_observationpost_02_97,W-why are you laughing like that?
d_ex_observationpost_02_98,Did I say something weird?
d_ex_observationpost_02_99,"You two make a good team, that's all."
d_ex_observationpost_02_100,I-I didn't expect any compliments!
d_ex_observationpost_02_101,Th-thank you?
d_ex_observationpost_02_102,Be careful up there.
d_ex_observationpost_02_103,Thank you.
d_ex_observationpost_02_104,"I promised we'd all go stargazing next time, and left the observatory."
d_ex_observationpost_03_title,Lending a Helping Hand
d_ex_observationpost_03_1,"I needed to confirm something, so I went to the Observatory."
d_ex_observationpost_03_2,*Buzz*
d_ex_observationpost_03_3,"When I get there, I see a silhouette."
d_ex_observationpost_03_4,*Gong gong*
d_ex_observationpost_03_5,Why isn't it working?
d_ex_observationpost_03_6,?
d_ex_observationpost_03_7,Who goes there?
d_ex_observationpost_03_8,Huh? That voice...
d_ex_observationpost_03_9,{AccountData.NickName}?
d_ex_observationpost_03_10,Snow White?
d_ex_observationpost_03_11,You're just in time. Can you help me out?
d_ex_observationpost_03_12,What are you doing here?
d_ex_observationpost_03_13,I heard you can find lots of Raptures near here.
d_ex_observationpost_03_14,But I don't know how to see them.
d_ex_observationpost_03_15,I think I should be using this machine...
d_ex_observationpost_03_16,Do you do anything other than search for Raptures?
d_ex_observationpost_03_17,Raptures are elusive little critters.
d_ex_observationpost_03_18,They're not easy to find... or get away from once you find them.
d_ex_observationpost_03_19,"So, I always follow up on every possible new opening."
d_ex_observationpost_03_20,I'm open to any method that could help me in locating them.
d_ex_observationpost_03_21,I have to find them before they murder any more people.
d_ex_observationpost_03_22,...
d_ex_observationpost_03_23,"Say, do you know how to use this thing?"
d_ex_observationpost_03_24,"I've tried everything, but I'm not getting anything."
d_ex_observationpost_03_25,Maybe this button?
d_ex_observationpost_03_26,*Beep beep*
d_ex_observationpost_03_27,Nope.
d_ex_observationpost_03_28,Check the Surface Observation Device.
d_ex_observationpost_03_29,Tell her how to operate the Surface Observation Device.
d_ex_observationpost_03_30,"Thanks, you're a lifesaver!"
d_ex_observationpost_03_31,"So all I have to do is look through here, right?"
d_ex_observationpost_03_32,Exactly. You should see some objects popping up on the left screen.
d_ex_observationpost_03_33,The left screen?
d_ex_observationpost_03_34,"Oh, I see! There are lots of red dots."
d_ex_observationpost_03_35,Those red dots are all Raptures.
d_ex_observationpost_03_36,Gotcha...
d_ex_observationpost_03_37,Let me record their coordinates for you.
d_ex_observationpost_03_38,Make sure you get them all!
d_ex_observationpost_03_39,"So I just press this button, right?"
d_ex_observationpost_03_40,"Yep, then look through here."
d_ex_observationpost_03_41,"Wow, it's so clear!"
d_ex_observationpost_03_42,There are hordes of Raptures all flocking together.
d_ex_observationpost_03_43,You can see their coordinates and roughly how many there are on the left screen.
d_ex_observationpost_03_44,Got it.
d_ex_observationpost_03_45,So all these red dots are Raptures then.
d_ex_observationpost_03_46,Anything else you want to know?
d_ex_observationpost_03_47,"No, I think I've got a good handle on it now."
d_ex_observationpost_03_48,I should be able to operate it by myself next time.
d_ex_observationpost_03_49,This thing is pretty nifty!
d_ex_observationpost_03_50,Now I'll be able to track Raptures with more precision.
d_ex_observationpost_03_51,"Thank you, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_observationpost_03_52,I could come here and check on the Raptures' whereabouts whenever I've got spare time. Do you think that'd be all right?
d_ex_observationpost_03_53,I'll obviously try not to disturb the Nikkes running this place.
d_ex_observationpost_03_54,You can come whenever you want.
d_ex_observationpost_03_55,Perfect!
d_ex_observationpost_03_56,"Well, now that I've got the coordinates for those Raptures, I shouldn't be dilly-dallying."
d_ex_observationpost_03_57,Gotta go.
d_ex_observationpost_03_58,Take care.
d_ex_observationpost_03_59,Snow White rushes off.
d_ex_observationpost_03_60,...
d_ex_observationpost_03_61,I've totally forgotten why I came to the Observatory in the first place. Might as well head back home.
d_ex_observationpost_04_title,One-of-a-Kind Show
d_ex_observationpost_04_1,"Signal, are you finished with the observation log?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_2,Erm...
d_ex_observationpost_04_3,"The log has to be kept up to date,"
d_ex_observationpost_04_4,to the very second.
d_ex_observationpost_04_5,S-sorry. I'll do it now.
d_ex_observationpost_04_6,Please do.
d_ex_observationpost_04_7,Signal left in a hurry.
d_ex_observationpost_04_8,You're awfully strict.
d_ex_observationpost_04_9,Why don't you do it yourself?
d_ex_observationpost_04_10,I have to be. Especially it comes to observation logs.
d_ex_observationpost_04_11,Even the tiniest sliver of incorrect information could spell disaster.
d_ex_observationpost_04_12,"Sure I could, and I could do it more efficiently."
d_ex_observationpost_04_13,But then there would be problems whenever I wasn't around. I just wish Signal could keep up with me.
d_ex_observationpost_04_14,"As the head of the Outpost, you should be learning how to keep an observation log as well, Commander."
d_ex_observationpost_04_15,"Yeah, but..."
d_ex_observationpost_04_16,It's not that difficult. All you need is some basic military knowledge.
d_ex_observationpost_04_17,Argh!!!
d_ex_observationpost_04_18,!!
d_ex_observationpost_04_19,"Signal, what happened?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_20,That..!!! There...!
d_ex_observationpost_04_21,...!!
d_ex_observationpost_04_22,... Did I do anything wrong?
d_ex_observationpost_04_23,Is... is that Noise? Am I dreaming?
d_ex_observationpost_04_24,I-I'm a huge fan! Would it be possible to get your autograph?
d_ex_observationpost_04_25,"Signal, calm down."
d_ex_observationpost_04_26,What are you doing here?
d_ex_observationpost_04_27,My mic cable is broken. I came to find a new one.
d_ex_observationpost_04_28,I figured the observatory would have a sound system.
d_ex_observationpost_04_29,I-I-I'm your...!
d_ex_observationpost_04_30,"We do, but it may not be exactly what you're looking for."
d_ex_observationpost_04_31,"Everything here is for military use, so your voice may not come out too clearly."
d_ex_observationpost_04_32,No biggie. I just need it for practice.
d_ex_observationpost_04_33,"All right, just a second. I'll bring one over."
d_ex_observationpost_04_34,"In exchange, may I make a request?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_35,...?
d_ex_observationpost_04_36,Please give Signal an autograph.
d_ex_observationpost_04_37,I-I-I'm your...!
d_ex_observationpost_04_38,No problem.
d_ex_observationpost_04_39,Soon after.
d_ex_observationpost_04_40,"Wow, this isn't as bad as I thought it'd be."
d_ex_observationpost_04_41,I brought you a new one.
d_ex_observationpost_04_42,"Thanks. Now, for the autograph..."
d_ex_observationpost_04_43,I-I-I'm your...!
d_ex_observationpost_04_44,...
d_ex_observationpost_04_45,"Delta, do you guys have any other audio equipment here?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_46,Sure we do.
d_ex_observationpost_04_47,Can I use it for a second?
d_ex_observationpost_04_48,"Of course you can, but why?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_49,"I want to sing a song for my superfan, and to thank you for your kindness."
d_ex_observationpost_04_50,Wh-what!?
d_ex_observationpost_04_51,"Is that okay, Producer?"
d_ex_observationpost_04_52,Of course.
d_ex_observationpost_04_53,Any requests?
d_ex_observationpost_04_54,Could you please sing a military song?
d_ex_observationpost_04_55,That... may be a little difficult.
d_ex_observationpost_04_56,"That day, Noise's voice echoed throughout the entire Outpost."
d_ex_police_01_title,Outpost Citizens
d_ex_police_01_1,Commander! Poli! I have a problem!
d_ex_police_01_2,Okay. Good luck with that.
d_ex_police_01_3,Wh-what?
d_ex_police_01_4,Um...
d_ex_police_01_5,Miranda looks at me.
d_ex_police_01_6,"It's as if she's saying, ""What should I do?"""
d_ex_police_01_7,What Poli said.
d_ex_police_01_8,What's the matter?
d_ex_police_01_9,"You too, Commander?"
d_ex_police_01_10,"All right, I'll think it over..."
d_ex_police_01_11,...
d_ex_police_01_12,Poli! I've got it!
d_ex_police_01_13,That was quick.
d_ex_police_01_14,Yep!
d_ex_police_01_15,"No no, Commander."
d_ex_police_01_16,"Don't humor her, otherwise she'll never drop those bad habits of hers."
d_ex_police_01_17,Hey! I don't have any bad habits!
d_ex_police_01_18,...
d_ex_police_01_19,"*Sigh* All right, what is it?"
d_ex_police_01_20,"The A.C.P.U.'s duty is to protect Ark citizens, right?"
d_ex_police_01_21,"Yes, and?"
d_ex_police_01_22,But we're at the Outpost right now.
d_ex_police_01_23,Correct again. So?
d_ex_police_01_24,So who do we protect in the Outpost?
d_ex_police_01_25,"If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say Outpost citizens."
d_ex_police_01_26,Outpost citizens? Who is that?
d_ex_police_01_27,Who is that? That's us!
d_ex_police_01_28,Who else is there besides the Commander and the other Nikkes?
d_ex_police_01_29,!!
d_ex_police_01_30,Really? So Nikkes can be citizens of the Outpost?
d_ex_police_01_31,Sure.
d_ex_police_01_32,So they were right.
d_ex_police_01_33,I have to take the complaints here seriously.
d_ex_police_01_34,Complaints?
d_ex_police_01_35,From who?
d_ex_police_01_36,"There were several people,"
d_ex_police_01_37,but Anis was the first.
d_ex_police_01_38,"One of the shower heads was broken,"
d_ex_police_01_39,and she wanted me to have Mighty Tools rush over and fix it.
d_ex_police_01_40,What?! She could fix that by herself! Why would she...
d_ex_police_01_41,There's more.
d_ex_police_01_42,A complaint from Absolute.
d_ex_police_01_43,Members of Matis were over by the generator hollering something about heroes and the like.
d_ex_police_01_44,They said that Matis better make themselves scarce before she blows up the entire building.
d_ex_police_01_45,"Emma wanted to remind us this is all Eunhwa's opinion,"
d_ex_police_01_46,and not of Absolute as a whole.
d_ex_police_01_47,Can't they just settle this amongst themselves? Why get us involved?!
d_ex_police_01_48,There's more.
d_ex_police_01_49,More?!
d_ex_police_01_50,It's from Folkwang.
d_ex_police_01_51,"She said the Outpost is sweltering, and that she feels like she's going to die."
d_ex_police_01_52,She wants air conditioning installed along all the streets.
d_ex_police_01_53,... Say that again?
d_ex_police_01_54,She wants A/C installed along the streets.
d_ex_police_01_55,"I don't know about the others, but I feel we should consider this one. Folkwang said she might die!"
d_ex_police_01_56,How can a Nikke die of heatstroke?!
d_ex_police_01_57,"If she thinks it's so hot, tell her to stay inside and turn on the A/C!"
d_ex_police_01_58,"What is wrong with these people?! They're driving me up the wall!
Do they even know what the police are meant for?! *Grrr*"
d_ex_police_01_59,P-Poli! You need to calm down!
d_ex_police_01_60,I pat Poli on the head.
d_ex_police_01_61,"There there, calm down."
d_ex_police_01_62,*Grrr..* *GRRRR*
d_ex_police_01_63,Poli pants angrily.
d_ex_police_01_64,Are you okay?
d_ex_police_01_65,...
d_ex_police_01_66,P... Poli?
d_ex_police_01_67,... Miranda.
d_ex_police_01_68,Yes?
d_ex_police_01_69,I take back what I said.
d_ex_police_01_70,The Commander is the only citizen of the Outpost.
d_ex_police_01_71,"From now on, protect the Commander only!"
d_ex_police_01_72,The Commander's complaints are the only ones that count! You got that?
d_ex_police_01_73,Understood!
d_ex_police_01_74,"If I receive any complaints, I will inform them they are not Outpost citizens,"
d_ex_police_01_75,and that they must figure it out themselves.
d_ex_police_01_76,"Yes, just like that!"
d_ex_police_01_77,...
d_ex_police_02_title,Conditions of Villainy
d_ex_police_02_1,Throw me in the clink already!
d_ex_police_02_2,No! We can't just lock someone up for no reason!
d_ex_police_02_3,Come back when you've done something wrong!
d_ex_police_02_4,Get that through that thick skull of yours and get out. We're busy!
d_ex_police_02_5,Or would you rather pay a fine for obstructing the law?
d_ex_police_02_6,What's the matter?
d_ex_police_02_7,"Oh, hi Commander."
d_ex_police_02_8,"We're completely swamped right now, and this weirdo keeps saying she wants to go to jail."
d_ex_police_02_9,*Grrrr*
d_ex_police_02_10,What are you doing here?
d_ex_police_02_11,"Since you're here, why don't you hear what I have to say?"
d_ex_police_02_12,Sure.
d_ex_police_02_13,No thanks.
d_ex_police_02_14,"As you know, my strength is immeasurable."
d_ex_police_02_15,That means I will soon become the ultimate villain.
d_ex_police_02_16,"Before that, I want to experience what it's like to be imprisoned,"
d_ex_police_02_17,but these idiots keep saying no!
d_ex_police_02_18,"Help me out, will you?"
d_ex_police_02_19,"Got it! Villainy, here we come!"
d_ex_police_02_20,What? You've got some nerve.
d_ex_police_02_21,The least you can do is hear me out.
d_ex_police_02_22,My time of becoming the ultimate villain is nigh.
d_ex_police_02_23,"Therefore, I should get a taste of what it's like being imprisoned."
d_ex_police_02_24,"However, these idiots are in the way."
d_ex_police_02_25,They're petrified at the thought of me becoming a villain!
d_ex_police_02_26,You've gotta help me!
d_ex_police_02_27,"Got it, you can count on me."
d_ex_police_02_28,"Sigh... would you PLEASE get out, both of you."
d_ex_police_02_29,"I'm disappointed in you, Commander."
d_ex_police_02_30,Indulging her in these silly fantasies.
d_ex_police_02_31,"Shame on you, Commander!"
d_ex_police_02_32,Can it! I don't need lip from some mongrel off her leash and a rookie cop!
d_ex_police_02_33,What?! I'm not a dog! *Grrr*
d_ex_police_02_34,"And I'm no rookie, thank you very much!"
d_ex_police_02_35,Neither side is going to back down.
d_ex_police_02_36,I should step up and smooth things over.
d_ex_police_02_37,You blithering dolts!
d_ex_police_02_38,I said get out! *Grrrr*
d_ex_police_02_39,"If you want to go to jail, you've got to do it right."
d_ex_police_02_40,What? Are you saying I need to commit an actual crime?
d_ex_police_02_41,Yes.
d_ex_police_02_42,"Commander, what are you saying?!"
d_ex_police_02_43,"Hmm. All right, let me hear it."
d_ex_police_02_44,Let's prank call the police station.
d_ex_police_02_45,Let's hassle a random pedestrian.
d_ex_police_02_46,"You do realize we can hear you, don't you?"
d_ex_police_02_47,"If I do that, they might miss a really important call!"
d_ex_police_02_48,I can't do that!
d_ex_police_02_49,You're saying I should bully someone who's defenseless?
d_ex_police_02_50,You're dumber than I thought!
d_ex_police_02_51,Why are you two still here?!
d_ex_police_02_52,Sigh... how should we handle this...
d_ex_police_02_53,Poli produces a small strip of paper from inside her notebook.
d_ex_police_02_54,What is that?
d_ex_police_02_55,This is a residential area I've been patrolling.
d_ex_police_02_56,Find this house with the red roof that's marked here.
d_ex_police_02_57,"In the morning and afternoon, ring the doorbell and hide."
d_ex_police_02_58,We'll apprehend you then and take you to jail.
d_ex_police_02_59,"A bit of ding dong ditch, eh?"
d_ex_police_02_60,"Yes, that will be your crime."
d_ex_police_02_61,"Hahaha, this is fun! That's actually not a bad idea."
d_ex_police_02_62,"If the police are ordering me to do something bad, then it's at least worth a shot."
d_ex_police_02_63,All right! I'll be back soon!
d_ex_police_02_64,Drake struts out of police station confidently.
d_ex_police_02_65,"Thank goodness, she's finally out of our hair."
d_ex_police_02_66,Won't her ringing the bell disturb whoever's inside?
d_ex_police_02_67,It's fine. An old lady lives there.
d_ex_police_02_68,and she has to take medication.
d_ex_police_02_69,"Sometimes she forgets to take it, so I've been thinking about setting up some kind of alarm for her. Now we've got one."
d_ex_police_02_70,"Good thinking, Poli!"
d_ex_police_02_71,"From now on, I'm locking the doors to the police station."
d_ex_police_02_72,"If Drake ever comes over, do not open the door."
d_ex_police_02_73,You got it!
d_ex_police_02_74,It seems Drake won't ever be coming back to the police station.
d_ex_police_03_title,A Predator Among Us
d_ex_police_03_1,Is this the place?
d_ex_police_03_2,Where you punish the guilty.
d_ex_police_03_3,"No, not here. This is the police station."
d_ex_police_03_4,Then what are those?
d_ex_police_03_5,Are those not for imprisoning and torturing criminals?
d_ex_police_03_6,Harran points at the holding cells which are separated by iron bars.
d_ex_police_03_7,"Miranda is standing in the corner of the detention center, facing the wall."
d_ex_police_03_8,... Miranda?
d_ex_police_03_9,Yes! I'm here! I wasn't sleeping! Promise!
d_ex_police_03_10,...
d_ex_police_03_11,Are you the owner of these cages?
d_ex_police_03_12,Owner? What are you talking about?
d_ex_police_03_13,I mean are you the one responsible for these cages.
d_ex_police_03_14,"Oh no, not at all! I'm only responsible for cleaning the cells."
d_ex_police_03_15,I see.
d_ex_police_03_16,Harran stares at the floor of the cells.
d_ex_police_03_17,"These ""cells"", as you call them, are immaculate."
d_ex_police_03_18,"They are built for the purpose of punishing criminals, yet they go unused."
d_ex_police_03_19,"Is it because there are no criminals in this place, or is this all just a show of force?"
d_ex_police_03_20,Well?
d_ex_police_03_21,???
d_ex_police_03_22,"All of these unused cells are just for show, is that it?"
d_ex_police_03_23,?????
d_ex_police_03_24,...
d_ex_police_03_25,Why are you not using this cell?
d_ex_police_03_26,We are!
d_ex_police_03_27,Then why is it so clean?
d_ex_police_03_28,"We're planning on holding a special ""detention room experience"", so it needs to be cleaned."
d_ex_police_03_29,Detention room experience? What is that?
d_ex_police_03_30,"Some people have expressed an interest in experiencing what it's like to stay in one of these cells, so we made a special... what's the word..."
d_ex_police_03_31,Program.
d_ex_police_03_32,Yes! A special program.
d_ex_police_03_33,Interesting.
d_ex_police_03_34,I suppose I would find occasionally playing as a prey amusing.
d_ex_police_03_35,Are there any special procedures to go through?
d_ex_police_03_36,"Nope, you can walk straight in! We'll let you out after an hour."
d_ex_police_03_37,I'd very much like to try.
d_ex_police_03_38,"All right, just leave your weapons here and head right in."
d_ex_police_03_39,Surrender my weapons? Is that really necessary?
d_ex_police_03_40,I'm afraid so. Rules are rules!
d_ex_police_03_41,And my raven?
d_ex_police_03_42,It's okay to take pets inside.
d_ex_police_03_43,Very well then. This should be interesting.
d_ex_police_03_44,Harran puts down her weapon and goes into the cell.
d_ex_police_03_45,*Bang* The door of the cell closed.
d_ex_police_03_46,"Huh, this cage is cruder than I thought. I'm sure I could bend it with a little effort."
d_ex_police_03_47,*Creak* *Creak* *Creak*
d_ex_police_03_48,What is that?
d_ex_police_03_49,"Hey, what's that ringing sound coming from the bars?"
d_ex_police_03_50,"Don't touch those, they're electrified!"
d_ex_police_03_51,Do you know how high the voltage is?
d_ex_police_03_52,"Touch those, and you'll come out extra crispy. That's all I know."
d_ex_police_03_53,...
d_ex_police_03_54,"I've changed my mind, let me out."
d_ex_police_03_55,Uh oh!
d_ex_police_03_56,"Sorry, that's the police siren. I've gotta go!"
d_ex_police_03_57,"Sugar and Epinel are street racing. Since I'm traffic police, that's my jurisdiction!"
d_ex_police_03_58,You just sit back and relax. You'll be out in an hour.
d_ex_police_03_59,"What?! Hey, wait!"
d_ex_police_03_60,*Whoosh*
d_ex_police_03_61,Miranda zips out in a flash.
d_ex_police_03_62,...
d_ex_police_03_63,...
d_ex_police_03_64,"Hey, you."
d_ex_police_03_65,Can you fetch me my weapon?
d_ex_police_03_66,I try to pick up Harran's weapon.
d_ex_police_03_67,...
d_ex_police_03_68,What's the problem?
d_ex_police_03_69,... It's too heavy. I can't lift it.
d_ex_police_03_70,...
d_ex_police_03_71,You've got to be kidding me.
d_ex_police_03_72,...
d_ex_police_03_73,...
d_ex_powerplant_01_title,Between Minus and Plus
d_ex_powerplant_01_1,"Maxwell, can I come in?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_2,"Who's... Oh... It's you, Cutey."
d_ex_powerplant_01_3,Please come... in?
d_ex_powerplant_01_4,"Eh, a new place."
d_ex_powerplant_01_5,"Servant, what is this place?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_6,!!
d_ex_powerplant_01_7,These electrical wave signals are dangerous.
d_ex_powerplant_01_8,They're definitely Minus energy.
d_ex_powerplant_01_9,"Ah, are you that famous serial killer?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_10,... Maxwell.
d_ex_powerplant_01_11,What is that?
d_ex_powerplant_01_12,What do you mean serial killer?
d_ex_powerplant_01_13,I've never heard someone call me that before.
d_ex_powerplant_01_14,I have never killed anything else other than Raptures.
d_ex_powerplant_01_15,Stop lying!
d_ex_powerplant_01_16,My cuties are nervous as hell!
d_ex_powerplant_01_17,Your cuties?
d_ex_powerplant_01_18,Do you mean these machines?
d_ex_powerplant_01_19,Ludmilla moves her hand.
d_ex_powerplant_01_20,No touching!
d_ex_powerplant_01_21,What are you doing?
d_ex_powerplant_01_22,Are you trying to murder them right under my nose?
d_ex_powerplant_01_23,Ludmilla stops her hand.
d_ex_powerplant_01_24,All right.
d_ex_powerplant_01_25,"By ""serial killer"" you mean,"
d_ex_powerplant_01_26,the Minus hand on this body?
d_ex_powerplant_01_27,"Now that you get it, put your hand down!"
d_ex_powerplant_01_28,Not unless you apologize for insulting me.
d_ex_powerplant_01_29,What if I refuse?
d_ex_powerplant_01_30,Who knows?
d_ex_powerplant_01_31,I don't like being rude.
d_ex_powerplant_01_32,"But I can meet your rudeness with the rudeness of my own, right?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_33,...
d_ex_powerplant_01_34,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so rude to someone I just met. Please forgive me.
d_ex_powerplant_01_35,Ludmilla puts her hand down.
d_ex_powerplant_01_36,I would also like to apologize for threatening your cuties.
d_ex_powerplant_01_37,"Say, your hands..."
d_ex_powerplant_01_38,My amazement grows just glancing at them.
d_ex_powerplant_01_39,How can a Nikke emit such amazing electrical waves?
d_ex_powerplant_01_40,Do you mean coming from my body?
d_ex_powerplant_01_41,"Yes, specifically from your hand."
d_ex_powerplant_01_42,Oh.
d_ex_powerplant_01_43,I've never been asked that before.
d_ex_powerplant_01_44,"Well, it's probably normal not knowing why. I'm just way more sensitive than most others."
d_ex_powerplant_01_45,"Eh... I just have to say, you are as amazing as Cutey."
d_ex_powerplant_01_46,"I hope,"
d_ex_powerplant_01_47,someday I can study and experiment with you.
d_ex_powerplant_01_48,"If you ask me,"
d_ex_powerplant_01_49,you seem really amazing yet frank at the same time.
d_ex_powerplant_01_50,"It's my personality, so just try to go with it."
d_ex_powerplant_01_51,"Haha, really? That's your personality?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_52,"Anyway, I can't lend you my hand just yet."
d_ex_powerplant_01_53,I still have to use it.
d_ex_powerplant_01_54,Don't worry about it. I have to test something else first.
d_ex_powerplant_01_55,You are still so far from being experimented on.
d_ex_powerplant_01_56,"Right, Cutey?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_57,...
d_ex_powerplant_01_58,"But, can you help me with the tests?"
d_ex_powerplant_01_59,The test will be like using a weapon that can withstand hits from your hand.
d_ex_powerplant_01_60,Or a glove that can block the electrical waves you emit.
d_ex_powerplant_01_61,That would be fun.
d_ex_powerplant_01_62,I am willing to help if that's the case.
d_ex_powerplant_01_63,I rarely come to the Outpost though.
d_ex_powerplant_01_64,"But if you message me,"
d_ex_powerplant_01_65,I will try to meet with you wherever I am.
d_ex_powerplant_01_66,"All right, I'll let you know if I already have something in mind."
d_ex_powerplant_02_title,Hero VS Villain VS ???
d_ex_powerplant_02_1,... Central control room within the power plant.
d_ex_powerplant_02_2,Take this!
d_ex_powerplant_02_3,Missed me.
d_ex_powerplant_02_4,Evade disruption!
d_ex_powerplant_02_5,I evade your evade disruption.
d_ex_powerplant_02_6,Would you two grow up? You'd hardly know you're adults by looking at you.
d_ex_powerplant_02_7,What are you two doing?
d_ex_powerplant_02_8,It's a new fighting game called... what was it again?
d_ex_powerplant_02_9,Operation Hero vs. Villain!
d_ex_powerplant_02_10,"Yes, that's it. They're already on their 51st battle."
d_ex_powerplant_02_11,They always end up tying.
d_ex_powerplant_02_12,"All right, it's time to decide the winner once and for all!"
d_ex_powerplant_02_13,Take this! My special move...
d_ex_powerplant_02_14,"Blink, blink. Beep."
d_ex_powerplant_02_15,...Power outage!
d_ex_powerplant_02_16,Power outage?!
d_ex_powerplant_02_17,You've got some nerve copying my move!
d_ex_powerplant_02_18,I don't think that's it...
d_ex_powerplant_02_19,I think the generator is malfunctioning.
d_ex_powerplant_02_20,"First things first, we've got to turn on the emergency power."
d_ex_powerplant_02_21,I already know how it happened.
d_ex_powerplant_02_22,*Woowoong-*
d_ex_powerplant_02_23,Power to the control room has been restored.
d_ex_powerplant_02_24,"As for the cause of the power outage, let's see..."
d_ex_powerplant_02_25,One of the consoles for the reactor is down.
d_ex_powerplant_02_26,"If we don't do something, we're in big trouble."
d_ex_powerplant_02_27,Was this a nuclear power plant?
d_ex_powerplant_02_28,What should we do now?
d_ex_powerplant_02_29,"Yes. There's no water supply, so hydroelectric power isn't an option."
d_ex_powerplant_02_30,"The air is polluted, so thermal power is a no-go as well."
d_ex_powerplant_02_31,"There isn't any wind or sunlight in this basement, either."
d_ex_powerplant_02_32,How on earth are we going to get energy?
d_ex_powerplant_02_33,You morons! That's not important right now!
d_ex_powerplant_02_34,Right! The heroic thing to do is fix the generator!
d_ex_powerplant_02_35,Isn't it obvious?
d_ex_powerplant_02_36,The heroic thing to do is fix the generator!
d_ex_powerplant_02_37,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_38,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_39,"Great minds think alike, eh Drake?"
d_ex_powerplant_02_40,... No.
d_ex_powerplant_02_41,"If you're going to fix the console, then I'm doing precisely the opposite."
d_ex_powerplant_02_42,Are you saying you're going to destroy the reactor?
d_ex_powerplant_02_43,Of course not!
d_ex_powerplant_02_44,What I mean is I'll go about fixing it in a different way.
d_ex_powerplant_02_45,"It's on now, Laplace."
d_ex_powerplant_02_46,"You and me, we'll see who comes out on top."
d_ex_powerplant_02_47,The final Villain vs. Hero battle. Let's settle this once and for all!
d_ex_powerplant_02_48,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_49,Power sprint!
d_ex_powerplant_02_50,Wha...that little weasel! She just took off!
d_ex_powerplant_02_51,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_52,"Hahaha! No problem, I know plenty of shortcuts."
d_ex_powerplant_02_53,Seems they're both willing to play dirty.
d_ex_powerplant_02_54,"Sometime later, the central control room."
d_ex_powerplant_02_55,It's already been 30 minutes since they left.
d_ex_powerplant_02_56,Why is the power still out?
d_ex_powerplant_02_57,Let's send a drone to find them.
d_ex_powerplant_02_58,Let's call them.
d_ex_powerplant_02_59,That's no use.
d_ex_powerplant_02_60,Both of them left their phones here.
d_ex_powerplant_02_61,Sending a drone to locate them would work better.
d_ex_powerplant_02_62,You read my mind.
d_ex_powerplant_02_63,Maxwell sends out a drone typically used for filming.
d_ex_powerplant_02_64,Another 30 minutes pass.
d_ex_powerplant_02_65,"Cutey-pie,"
d_ex_powerplant_02_66,I've got Laplace on-screen.
d_ex_powerplant_02_67,Hero Charge!
d_ex_powerplant_02_68,Smash!
d_ex_powerplant_02_69,"Perfect, the reactor is straight ahead!"
d_ex_powerplant_02_70,All I have to do is toss myself into that molten hot plasma.
d_ex_powerplant_02_71,I'll have the reactor repaired in no time.
d_ex_powerplant_02_72,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_73,Would doing that repair the generator?
d_ex_powerplant_02_74,"Of course not, she's being a complete fool."
d_ex_powerplant_02_75,Drake is our only hope now.
d_ex_powerplant_02_76,*Huff huff*
d_ex_powerplant_02_77,Why is this taking so long?
d_ex_powerplant_02_78,Aren't vents usually a great shortcut in the movies?
d_ex_powerplant_02_79,I was hoping it would at least let me spring a surprise attack...
d_ex_powerplant_02_80,"Either way, I should get there faster than Laplace."
d_ex_powerplant_02_81,Ha- Hahaha! Ha- haha...
d_ex_powerplant_02_82,Gasp. Cough...
d_ex_powerplant_02_83,What is she doing?!
d_ex_powerplant_02_84,Drake is heading in the wrong direction.
d_ex_powerplant_02_85,She's moving away from the power plant.
d_ex_powerplant_02_86,That vent she's in ends with a sheer cliff.
d_ex_powerplant_02_87,... Oh well.
d_ex_powerplant_02_88,I guess we'll have to use the drones for the repairs.
d_ex_powerplant_02_89,You mean that's always been an option?
d_ex_powerplant_02_90,Why didn't you say that before?!
d_ex_powerplant_02_91,Of course.
d_ex_powerplant_02_92,They both ran off before I had time to explain.
d_ex_powerplant_02_93,Well...
d_ex_powerplant_02_94,I suppose they did run off before I could explain but...
d_ex_powerplant_02_95,"Also, I just want them to settle this ridiculous rivalry between themselves."
d_ex_powerplant_02_96,I'm dying for some peace and quiet around here.
d_ex_powerplant_02_97,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_98,... 5 minutes later.
d_ex_powerplant_02_99,Hero Charge!
d_ex_powerplant_02_100,Beep.
d_ex_powerplant_02_101,The power's back on?
d_ex_powerplant_02_102,*Crash*
d_ex_powerplant_02_103,...Argh.
d_ex_powerplant_02_104,Hehe...
d_ex_powerplant_02_105,"So you managed to do it, eh Drake?"
d_ex_powerplant_02_106,*Wheeze*
d_ex_powerplant_02_107,Does this vent ever end...
d_ex_powerplant_02_108,Beep.
d_ex_powerplant_02_109,This can't be. Did Laplace...!?
d_ex_powerplant_02_110,I can't believe it! How can I lose someone like her?!
d_ex_powerplant_02_111,...
d_ex_powerplant_02_112,"Wait, how do I get back?"
d_ex_powerplant_02_113,"In the end, despite never being part of the final match,"
d_ex_powerplant_02_114,Maxwell ended up winning the final round of Hero vs. Villain.
d_ex_powerplant_03_title,Hard-working Scavengers
d_ex_powerplant_03_1,*Buzz*
d_ex_powerplant_03_2,Invasion succ...
d_ex_powerplant_03_3,What is that?
d_ex_powerplant_03_4,What brings you here? Is something wrong?
d_ex_powerplant_03_5,I should be asking you the same thing.
d_ex_powerplant_03_6,The Nikkes running this place asked if I could cover for them.
d_ex_powerplant_03_7,You mean the Nikkes from Matis?
d_ex_powerplant_03_8,So they're not here today? Nice.
d_ex_powerplant_03_9,So again...what exactly are you doing here?
d_ex_powerplant_03_10,"Oh, it's nothing special."
d_ex_powerplant_03_11,We received a job offer from this Nikke who's well-off.
d_ex_powerplant_03_12,What kind of job?
d_ex_powerplant_03_13,Something to do with electricity.
d_ex_powerplant_03_14,"Yeah, that's right."
d_ex_powerplant_03_15,"The client wants us to take some of the surplus electricity from the power plant and reroute it to the Ark, or something like that."
d_ex_powerplant_03_16,Have you informed your superiors?
d_ex_powerplant_03_17,"Well, that's the thing."
d_ex_powerplant_03_18,"Laplace is such a Mary Sue,"
d_ex_powerplant_03_19,and what we're about to do is... how shall I put it...
d_ex_powerplant_03_20,"We're ""borrowing"" surplus power and rerouting it to places that need it more."
d_ex_powerplant_03_21,Good. Very good.
d_ex_powerplant_03_22,"That's right. So, can we go now?"
d_ex_powerplant_03_23,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_24,What should I do?
d_ex_powerplant_03_25,Ignore them.
d_ex_powerplant_03_26,Follow them quietly.
d_ex_powerplant_03_27,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_28,What if something goes wrong? I should keep tabs on them.
d_ex_powerplant_03_29,I head over to the security office to check on them.
d_ex_powerplant_03_30,"A while later, in the central control room of the power plant."
d_ex_powerplant_03_31,... Huh.
d_ex_powerplant_03_32,"The client asked us to switch the pipelines,"
d_ex_powerplant_03_33,but look at how many there are! How the heck are we supposed to know which ones to reroute?
d_ex_powerplant_03_34,Don't know. Pick one.
d_ex_powerplant_03_35,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_36,"All right, here goes nothing."
d_ex_powerplant_03_37,*Clap clap*
d_ex_powerplant_03_38,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_39,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_40,All good?
d_ex_powerplant_03_41,No dice.
d_ex_powerplant_03_42,Try different one.
d_ex_powerplant_03_43,"I know, don't rush me!"
d_ex_powerplant_03_44,*Buzz buzz crack*
d_ex_powerplant_03_45,The plant loses power.
d_ex_powerplant_03_46,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_47,Wrong one again!
d_ex_powerplant_03_48,Another!
d_ex_powerplant_03_49,*Buzz crack*
d_ex_powerplant_03_50,The entire Outpost loses electricity.
d_ex_powerplant_03_51,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_52,Wrong one. Do again.
d_ex_powerplant_03_53,"It's pitch black in here, how do you expect me to connect them?"
d_ex_powerplant_03_54,Give up?
d_ex_powerplant_03_55,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_56,"No, no... Let's try this again."
d_ex_powerplant_03_57,"A while later, I find myself groping around in the dark trying to find Frima and Milk."
d_ex_powerplant_03_58,"At this point, there's a power outage across the entire Outpost."
d_ex_powerplant_03_59,They've really gone and done it this time.
d_ex_powerplant_03_60,What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
d_ex_powerplant_03_61,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_62,I know I screwed up. You don't have to rub it in.
d_ex_powerplant_03_63,This is a task meant for someone with a bit more finesse.
d_ex_powerplant_03_64,We should be off on the front line going toe-to-toe with the enemy.
d_ex_powerplant_03_65,"Frima, you're the leader, shouldn't you be saying something?"
d_ex_powerplant_03_66,...
d_ex_powerplant_03_67,... Cool.
d_ex_shopping_01_title,Serious Shopping Savings
d_ex_shopping_01_1,"I can't say I was expecting much,"
d_ex_shopping_01_2,but now that I'm here...
d_ex_shopping_01_3,this shopping mall really is a dump!
d_ex_shopping_01_4,"Not a single pair of leather shoes or clutch bags.
There aren't even any restaurants where you can grill Nutrium."
d_ex_shopping_01_5,"Compared to the malls in Royal Road, it's practically a hole in the ground."
d_ex_shopping_01_6,You think so?
d_ex_shopping_01_7,Yes! This place should be ashamed of calling itself a shopping mall... huh?!
d_ex_shopping_01_8,How long have you been listening?
d_ex_shopping_01_9,From the beginning.
d_ex_shopping_01_10,"As a member of Talentum, it is my job to take care of this mall."
d_ex_shopping_01_11,That includes looking after any unsatisfied customers.
d_ex_shopping_01_12,Allow me to take you
d_ex_shopping_01_13,to the VIP shopping area.
d_ex_shopping_01_14,The only one of its kind in the Outpost.
d_ex_shopping_01_15,What? A VIP area in the Outpost? That's impossible!
d_ex_shopping_01_16,"What I mean is... even if there was such a place, surely it would be laughable."
d_ex_shopping_01_17,The one you are with seems interested.
d_ex_shopping_01_18,I am.
d_ex_shopping_01_19,"I suppose it's fine, so long as we're just window shopping."
d_ex_shopping_01_20,"All right, then..."
d_ex_shopping_01_21,Dolla holds up her walkie-talkie.
d_ex_shopping_01_22,Is this the VIP manager?
d_ex_shopping_01_23,"Yes, this is the hotel manager, could you have the staff ready? I'm bringing two customers."
d_ex_shopping_01_24,"Also, prepare the following items..."
d_ex_shopping_01_25,"A bit later,
inside the VIP exclusive area inside the shopping mall."
d_ex_shopping_01_26,"Here in the VIP area, you'll not only find exclusive items,"
d_ex_shopping_01_27,but goods which cater exclusively to the customer's taste.
d_ex_shopping_01_28,"For example, here we have a Tiara made of silver and germanium ions, which works wonders for the skin."
d_ex_shopping_01_29,Then there's this handkerchief with French embroidery featuring a floral pattern.
d_ex_shopping_01_30,All of the items here are perfectly suited to match your own elegance.
d_ex_shopping_01_31,...!!
d_ex_shopping_01_32,Are you feeling a bit better about our establishment now?
d_ex_shopping_01_33,"Well, maybe a little..."
d_ex_shopping_01_34,"Ah yes, I nearly forgot. This product is sold only at our mall."
d_ex_shopping_01_35,Our line of very own fresh juice vitamins.
d_ex_shopping_01_36,"As you both know, there are many vitamins which prevent our skin from aging."
d_ex_shopping_01_37,"However, given that Splendamin is our main food staple, it's impossible for us to extract the necessary nutrients from fruits."
d_ex_shopping_01_38,"Inevitably, this will result in aged skin and pimples, even for typically ageless Nikkes."
d_ex_shopping_01_39,Th-that can't be...!
d_ex_shopping_01_40,"... However! With these supplemental vitamins, you need not fear."
d_ex_shopping_01_41,Just one pill a day is all it takes.
d_ex_shopping_01_42,"Of course, our unlimited life expectancy means you'll have to purchase quite a few of them!"
d_ex_shopping_01_43,Can't I just buy them as I need them?
d_ex_shopping_01_44,"Well, I'm not sure."
d_ex_shopping_01_45,"This is a popular item amongst female customers, so it's often out of stock."
d_ex_shopping_01_46,But today's your lucky day!
d_ex_shopping_01_47,We've just received a new shipment.
d_ex_shopping_01_48,"So if you see something you want, I suggest you buy it today. Otherwise, it'll be gone come tomorrow."
d_ex_shopping_01_49,But I don't have that much money on me right now...
d_ex_shopping_01_50,No need to worry!
d_ex_shopping_01_51,We're offering a special 10 year installment plan for Nikke customers only!
d_ex_shopping_01_52,You're unbelievable...
d_ex_shopping_01_53,"Haha, thank you for the kind words!"
d_ex_shopping_01_54,"So if we apply a 10 year installment plan,"
d_ex_shopping_01_55,"the total amount of items here is only 30,000 credits."
d_ex_shopping_01_56,"If you eat 5 less pieces of Splendamin per month for the next 10 years, everything here is yours."
d_ex_shopping_01_57,...
d_ex_shopping_01_58,Privaty?
d_ex_shopping_01_59,She's taking you for a ride.
d_ex_shopping_01_60,Eeeek...!
d_ex_shopping_01_61,A bit later.
d_ex_shopping_01_62,I can't believe I actually bought all of it...
d_ex_shopping_01_63,I couldn't refuse. It was like I was possessed.
d_ex_shopping_01_64,"That place is terrifying.
I need to stop going there."
d_ex_shopping_01_65,What is this anyway?
d_ex_shopping_01_66,Privaty takes out a pamphlet from a shopping bag.
d_ex_shopping_01_67,"You have spent 3.6 million credits.
Spend another 400,000 credits to reach 4 million credits"
d_ex_shopping_01_68,and receive a limited-edition cosmetic set made using thermal spring water valued at 1 million credits.
d_ex_shopping_01_69,I spent that much all in one day?
d_ex_shopping_01_70,Oh no!
d_ex_shopping_01_71,... I should go back.
d_ex_shopping_01_72,Wait a minute!
d_ex_shopping_01_73,No way!
d_ex_shopping_01_74,I'm almost at 4 million credits!
d_ex_shopping_01_75,"If I spend just 400,000 more, I'll get that cosmetic set worth 1 million credits! This is my only chance!"
d_ex_shopping_01_76,Made using thermal spring water... you can't even find that on Royal Road. I've got to have it.
d_ex_shopping_01_77,Privaty!
d_ex_shopping_01_78,Privaty runs to the shopping mall.
d_ex_shopping_02_title,The Food Chain
d_ex_shopping_02_1,"I've been so lethargic lately, and I don't know why..."
d_ex_shopping_02_2,I don't have any energy...
d_ex_shopping_02_3,"Well then, this supplement is perfect for depression!"
d_ex_shopping_02_4,"Also, since I sweat so much, I sometimes feel like I don't have a lot of energy."
d_ex_shopping_02_5,Apparently it's 'cause my body is lacking vitamins.
d_ex_shopping_02_6,Folkwang and Vesti are at a pharmacy.
d_ex_shopping_02_7,They're browsing through various supplements.
d_ex_shopping_02_8,"So if you're feeling lethargic, take some multi-vitamins."
d_ex_shopping_02_9,Multi-vitamins?
d_ex_shopping_02_10,"Oh, Coach! Fancy seeing you here."
d_ex_shopping_02_11,C-Commander.
d_ex_shopping_02_12,What are you two doing?
d_ex_shopping_02_13,Vesti hasn't been feeling too good lately.
d_ex_shopping_02_14,I was recommended some supplements to her.
d_ex_shopping_02_15,Such as...?
d_ex_shopping_02_16,"Multi-vitamins, to be specific."
d_ex_shopping_02_17,"What do you think, Vesti? Just for a month."
d_ex_shopping_02_18,Do you really think these will give me more energy?
d_ex_shopping_02_19,"Oh, if it's the energy you want,"
d_ex_shopping_02_20,you should take some Energy Blast as well.
d_ex_shopping_02_21,You sound like a salesman.
d_ex_shopping_02_22,"I just make some recommendations! I know a lot about supplements, that's all."
d_ex_shopping_02_23,"It's buy two, get one free for Energy Blast, so better pick up two."
d_ex_shopping_02_24,"All that for just 100,000 credits."
d_ex_shopping_02_25,"Folkwang goes through explaining all the various nutritional supplements, sweating all the while."
d_ex_shopping_02_26,"If you want the best effect, you've got to take these regularly for several months."
d_ex_shopping_02_27,Really? Sounds kinda expensi...
d_ex_shopping_02_28,You can't put a price on your own health!
d_ex_shopping_02_29,I take Icy Blast all the time.
d_ex_shopping_02_30,"Having said that, how come it's so hot in here?"
d_ex_shopping_02_31,They don't seem very effective...
d_ex_shopping_02_32,"Commander, what do you think? Should I buy these?"
d_ex_shopping_02_33,Buy them.
d_ex_shopping_02_34,Don't buy them.
d_ex_shopping_02_35,See? Even the Commander agrees with me!
d_ex_shopping_02_36,"Take these babies for one month, and you'll notice the difference."
d_ex_shopping_02_37,"Really? Are you sure, Commander? I guess I'll buy..."
d_ex_shopping_02_38,"Coach, there's no better supplements cocktail than this."
d_ex_shopping_02_39,It was too expensive.
d_ex_shopping_02_40,Yeah! Who can afford that?
d_ex_shopping_02_41,Wait! I didn't know they had this supplement here!
d_ex_shopping_02_42,This will give you even better results.
d_ex_shopping_02_43,It's called Dynamo.
d_ex_shopping_02_44,"This is super hard to come by, and they're selling it in bulk here!"
d_ex_shopping_02_45,"Vesti, you can't pass this stuff up!"
d_ex_shopping_02_46,But... this is all too much...
d_ex_shopping_02_47,"Trust me, this stuff has been impossible to find for the past few days."
d_ex_shopping_02_48,But I don't think I need it...
d_ex_shopping_02_49,"Fine, fine. Then... holy moly, what's this doing here?!"
d_ex_shopping_02_50,Surely you know about Metablue?
d_ex_shopping_02_51,What's that?
d_ex_shopping_02_52,"You don't know? Take just one of these in the morning, and you're set for the whole day."
d_ex_shopping_02_53,It's head and shoulders above any other anti-fatigue supplement out there.
d_ex_shopping_02_54,I'm not a big fan of liquid medicine... I-I don't think I need...
d_ex_shopping_02_55,It also comes in a pill version for Nikkes.
d_ex_shopping_02_56,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
d_ex_shopping_02_57,Yan was walking by and stops after seeing us.
d_ex_shopping_02_58,Checking out supplements.
d_ex_shopping_02_59,"So you're interested in buying something, Vesti?"
d_ex_shopping_02_60,"If those dark circles under your eyes are any indication, what you have there isn't nearly enough."
d_ex_shopping_02_61,Really? Then how much more do I have to buy?
d_ex_shopping_02_62,"As you know, you have to take supplements regularly."
d_ex_shopping_02_63,Multi-vitamins and Energy Blast only cover the basics.
d_ex_shopping_02_64,"I get the sense that you're quite stressed, yes?"
d_ex_shopping_02_65,H-how did you know?
d_ex_shopping_02_66,Even a blind man could see that.
d_ex_shopping_02_67,It looks like you need Rocket Booster as well.
d_ex_shopping_02_68,"That all comes out to 150,000 credits,"
d_ex_shopping_02_69,"but I'll give it to you for 130,000."
d_ex_shopping_02_70,"And, if you buy it right now, I'll toss in an extra Rocket Booster."
d_ex_shopping_02_71,One sip of this and you'll feel your stress melt away.
d_ex_shopping_02_72,I'm also sensing that you suffer from feelings of insecurity?
d_ex_shopping_02_73,All the time! How did you know?
d_ex_shopping_02_74,"This here helps your mind settle down, but at the same time increases your strength."
d_ex_shopping_02_75,"After all, your mind has to be at ease in order to work and fight effectively, isn't that right?"
d_ex_shopping_02_76,"Just take these, and I guarantee you'll see a difference."
d_ex_shopping_02_77,That takes care of you. Now your turn.
d_ex_shopping_02_78,Huh? Me?
d_ex_shopping_02_79,Definitely water based... What kind of supplements are you taking now?
d_ex_shopping_02_80,Icy Blast...
d_ex_shopping_02_81,Is that it?
d_ex_shopping_02_82,That's not going to cut it.
d_ex_shopping_02_83,"You're sensitive to heat, yes?"
d_ex_shopping_02_84,"Um... yeah. I'm burning up right now, actually."
d_ex_shopping_02_85,There's a new supplement you can take along with Icy Blast.
d_ex_shopping_02_86,It's called Wintry Lady.
d_ex_shopping_02_87,"It hasn't hit the market just yet, but it'll go great with Icy Blast."
d_ex_shopping_02_88,"Typically it goes for 80,000 credits, but"
d_ex_shopping_02_89,"we're all friends here, so how does 50,000 sound?"
d_ex_shopping_02_90,"The way you describe it, I'm feeling cooler already!"
d_ex_shopping_02_91,"But 50,000 credits..."
d_ex_shopping_02_92,Too expensive? I promise you it's cheaper than what you'll get online.
d_ex_shopping_02_93,"If you try to buy this later, you'll end up paying more."
d_ex_shopping_02_94,Really? I feel like I'm burning up...
d_ex_shopping_02_95,And see what it says here on the box? Improved circulation.
d_ex_shopping_02_96,Better circulation is vital to avoid overheating.
d_ex_shopping_02_97,"Since you seem to run hot, this is a must for you."
d_ex_shopping_02_98,"For people like you that are quick to heat up, this is the perfect supplement."
d_ex_shopping_02_99,You really think so?
d_ex_shopping_02_100,"Since you've got quite a few different supplements here,"
d_ex_shopping_02_101,I'll toss in a pill organizer for free. Sound good?
d_ex_shopping_02_102,"You look like you could use some supplements as well, Rookie."
d_ex_shopping_02_103,"I'm fine, thanks."
d_ex_shopping_02_104,What kind of supplements?
d_ex_shopping_02_105,You'll end up running your body ragged.
d_ex_shopping_02_106,You should at least take Omega-3 and Speedboost.
d_ex_shopping_02_107,"Judging by your complexion, you must be under a lot of stress."
d_ex_shopping_02_108,Omega-3 and Speedboost would work wonders for you.
d_ex_shopping_02_109,"I'll give you both for 50,000."
d_ex_shopping_02_110,"As you get on in years, your body won't seem like it used to. You know that right?"
d_ex_shopping_02_111,You've got to start taking care of it here and now.
d_ex_shopping_02_112,I'm not at that point yet.
d_ex_shopping_02_113,"I think you're wrong. Every morning you wake up, you'll feel death drawing ever nearer."
d_ex_shopping_02_114,I'll think it over...
d_ex_shopping_02_115,Taking supplements after you're already sick won't do a lick of good!
d_ex_shopping_02_116,"You may save money on supplements, but your future hospital bills will be through the roof."
d_ex_shopping_02_117,You'd be a fool not to jump at these prices.
d_ex_shopping_02_118,"You see that price-tag? You won't find that anywhere else, not even online."
d_ex_shopping_02_119,Yan shows us the market price of the supplements from her tablet.
d_ex_shopping_02_120,"I'm giving you a discount, so take it!"
d_ex_shopping_02_121,"Almost under duress, the three of us pay and leave."
d_ex_shopping_03_title,Tuna vs Chicken
d_ex_shopping_03_1,"I'm out and about by myself for the first time in a while, when I see Admi outside of a shop."
d_ex_shopping_03_2,Admi...
d_ex_shopping_03_3,...
d_ex_shopping_03_4,?
d_ex_shopping_03_5,Admi?
d_ex_shopping_03_6,?!
d_ex_shopping_03_7,"Oh! Hello there, Commander!"
d_ex_shopping_03_8,How long have you been standing there?
d_ex_shopping_03_9,A while now.
d_ex_shopping_03_10,I just arrived.
d_ex_shopping_03_11,Really?
d_ex_shopping_03_12,"I didn't notice you, sorry."
d_ex_shopping_03_13,As long as I didn't keep you waiting.
d_ex_shopping_03_14,Are you here to buy something?
d_ex_shopping_03_15,"I was just out for a stroll and saw you, so I thought I'd say hello."
d_ex_shopping_03_16,What is this place?
d_ex_shopping_03_17,A pet supply shop.
d_ex_shopping_03_18,"I always see so many stray cats wandering the streets,"
d_ex_shopping_03_19,"and if I want to catch them safely, I'll need some snacks to attract them."
d_ex_shopping_03_20,"According to my research, Splendamin isn't too healthy for our furry friends,"
d_ex_shopping_03_21,so I'm here to find some snacks that are okay for cats.
d_ex_shopping_03_22,I didn't realize finding cat treats was such an ordeal.
d_ex_shopping_03_23,"There are so many different kinds of treats, and I have no idea which is their favorite."
d_ex_shopping_03_24,But I think I've made some progress. I've narrowed it down to these two.
d_ex_shopping_03_25,I just don't know which one to pick.
d_ex_shopping_03_26,Why not buy them both?
d_ex_shopping_03_27,"I considered it,"
d_ex_shopping_03_28,"but there's no guarantee when or where I'll actually run into any stray cats, so buying that many treats may not be a good idea."
d_ex_shopping_03_29,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_03_30,"How about you pick one for me, Commander?"
d_ex_shopping_03_31,Me?
d_ex_shopping_03_32,"Sure, just pick one and that's what I'll buy."
d_ex_shopping_03_33,"Otherwise, I'll be here all day hesitating."
d_ex_shopping_03_34,Pleeeaaaase?
d_ex_shopping_03_35,Tuna paste in a tube.
d_ex_shopping_03_36,Chicken in a can.
d_ex_shopping_03_37,I've heard no cat
d_ex_shopping_03_38,can resist the taste of tuna.
d_ex_shopping_03_39,So this should be perfect!
d_ex_shopping_03_40,"All I'll have to do is squeeze a little bit out,"
d_ex_shopping_03_41,and they'll come right up to me.
d_ex_shopping_03_42,"Yeah, you can't go wrong with chicken."
d_ex_shopping_03_43,"An oldie, but a goodie."
d_ex_shopping_03_44,Those little guys are gonna love it.
d_ex_shopping_03_45,"All I'll have to do is crack open the can, set it on the ground,"
d_ex_shopping_03_46,and they'll come right up to me.
d_ex_shopping_03_47,...
d_ex_shopping_03_48,"All right, it's settled then. I'll get this one."
d_ex_shopping_03_49,Are you sure?
d_ex_shopping_03_50,"Yes, I'm sure."
d_ex_shopping_03_51,"Besides, I can always try the other one next time."
d_ex_shopping_03_52,Do you think the cats will like it?
d_ex_shopping_03_53,They'll love it.
d_ex_shopping_03_54,... All right!
d_ex_shopping_03_55,I'll go to the counter.
d_ex_shopping_03_56,After a while.
d_ex_shopping_03_57,Admi exits the store after buying the cat treats.
d_ex_shopping_03_58,"Thanks for helping me make a decision, Commander."
d_ex_shopping_03_59,"If it hadn't been for you, I'd still be in there unable to decide."
d_ex_shopping_03_60,"Anyway, here's a little something for you."
d_ex_shopping_03_61,I'm not sure if it's your style though...
d_ex_shopping_03_62,Admi gives me a cat keychain.
d_ex_shopping_03_63,It's nice.
d_ex_shopping_03_64,Glad you like it!
d_ex_shopping_03_65,"If you're done here, do you want to head back together?"
d_ex_shopping_03_66,"Admi and I head out of the mall, cat treats in tow."
d_ex_theater_01_title,Music and Wine
d_ex_theater_01_1,My Lord! Over here!
d_ex_theater_01_2,Isn't this the theater?
d_ex_theater_01_3,"Yeah, what do you think?"
d_ex_theater_01_4,It's roomy.
d_ex_theater_01_5,Isn't this the most wondrous place for a drink?
d_ex_theater_01_6,Julia should be here to practice violin. Where is she?
d_ex_theater_01_7,Practice violin?
d_ex_theater_01_8,Conductor?
d_ex_theater_01_9,Hey... behold who is here!
d_ex_theater_01_10,Our musical girl!
d_ex_theater_01_11,"Oh... it's you, the wanderer on the surface."
d_ex_theater_01_12,Thanks a lot for what you did before.
d_ex_theater_01_13,Do you know each other?
d_ex_theater_01_14,"Yes. I was almost killed last time on the surface,"
d_ex_theater_01_15,and she saved me by landing a hit with the shining moon light.
d_ex_theater_01_16,She did?
d_ex_theater_01_17,"Hehe, don't praise me liketh that."
d_ex_theater_01_18,Your performance warmed my soul.
d_ex_theater_01_19,"Death wast upon you,"
d_ex_theater_01_20,but thou hast shown no fear and never stopped playing. It was the epitome of grace.
d_ex_theater_01_21,"So, to make sure thy performance could go on, I cleaned up those Raptures."
d_ex_theater_01_22,"So, what brings you here?"
d_ex_theater_01_23,"I just did want to go out on a walk, feel the breeze in my face, and watch the clouds."
d_ex_theater_01_24,"Besides, the weather is good so I asketh my Lord to come out and have a little drink."
d_ex_theater_01_25,I see.
d_ex_theater_01_26,You are here to have a drink.
d_ex_theater_01_27,"Hehe, saying such a brief sentence is not thy style..."
d_ex_theater_01_28,How can you drink without music?
d_ex_theater_01_29,Would you perform for us?
d_ex_theater_01_30,Of course.
d_ex_theater_01_31,"Just like what I said before,"
d_ex_theater_01_32,I will repay you with my music some day.
d_ex_theater_01_33,... Hehe.
d_ex_theater_01_34,Your music as appetizers must be surprisingly delicious.
d_ex_theater_01_35,What's your favorite music?
d_ex_theater_01_36,Well...
d_ex_theater_01_37,Which kind of music should I like?
d_ex_theater_01_38,I guess it should be something like Scarlet?
d_ex_theater_01_39,Something like me?
d_ex_theater_01_40,Something like a wanderer?
d_ex_theater_01_41,"So the music must be something graceful yet sharp,"
d_ex_theater_01_42,with a sense of spirituality and tranquility.
d_ex_theater_01_43,That sounded complex.
d_ex_theater_01_44,Am I really like that?
d_ex_theater_01_45,"Yes, it might be quite challenging for me."
d_ex_theater_01_46,But that makes it more meaningful as well.
d_ex_theater_01_47,"So, could you please settle down on the stage already?"
d_ex_theater_01_48,I sit down on the stage with Scarlet.
d_ex_theater_01_49,"Now, please relax and enjoy my music."
d_ex_theater_01_50,"The three of us, on a dark stage,"
d_ex_theater_01_51,with nothing but light from the spotlight.
d_ex_theater_01_52,"Together with the sound of Julia's violin,"
d_ex_theater_01_53,Scarlet and I clink glasses.
d_ex_theater_01_54,Ah.
d_ex_theater_01_55,This feels so nice.
d_ex_theater_01_56,What a pleasant night.
d_ex_theater_02_title,Three's a Crowd
d_ex_theater_02_1,"Over here, Commander."
d_ex_theater_02_2,You're early.
d_ex_theater_02_3,"I was so excited about seeing the movie, I woke up early."
d_ex_theater_02_4,"I thought I might lose the USB, so I've been gripping it super tight."
d_ex_theater_02_5,What movie are we watching?
d_ex_theater_02_6,It's called The Ferocious Feline.
d_ex_theater_02_7,"I've wanted to see it for ages, and it's finally available for rental."
d_ex_theater_02_8,"Do you like cats, Commander?"
d_ex_theater_02_9,I do.
d_ex_theater_02_10,I'm more of a dog person.
d_ex_theater_02_11,So do I!
d_ex_theater_02_12,Apparently this movie is a real hidden gem.
d_ex_theater_02_13,"It's filled with lots of cute cats, too."
d_ex_theater_02_14,Sounds fun.
d_ex_theater_02_15,I certainly hope so!
d_ex_theater_02_16,"Oh... well, dogs are cute too."
d_ex_theater_02_17,...
d_ex_theater_02_18,Uh... Then do you want to watch something else?
d_ex_theater_02_19,It's okay. I like cats too.
d_ex_theater_02_20,"Phew, that's a relief. I heard this movie's filled with a lot of cute cats."
d_ex_theater_02_21,Hopefully you'll like it.
d_ex_theater_02_22,Should we head in?
d_ex_theater_02_23,"Admi connects the USB to the projector, then we take our seats in the middle of the theater."
d_ex_theater_02_24,We've got the entire theater to ourselves.
d_ex_theater_02_25,This way we can really focus on the movie.
d_ex_theater_02_26,The film opens with a family who has recently moved into a new house.
d_ex_theater_02_27,"The family gets along with each other, but"
d_ex_theater_02_28,"after some time goes by, things start disappearing and mysterious sounds can be heard in the house."
d_ex_theater_02_29,"Soon, the family starts to become affected by these mysterious events."
d_ex_theater_02_30,"I'm telling you, there's someone else in this house!"
d_ex_theater_02_31,You have to trust me! Please!
d_ex_theater_02_32,... Where are the cats?
d_ex_theater_02_33,I thought I'd picked The Ferocious Feline...
d_ex_theater_02_34,Is this a different movie?
d_ex_theater_02_35,"It's okay, let's keep watching anyway."
d_ex_theater_02_36,Definitely seems like a different movie.
d_ex_theater_02_37,"Who knows, maybe a cat is behind everything."
d_ex_theater_02_38,It could be hiding and toying with them.
d_ex_theater_02_39,Cats are always causing trouble on the sly like that...
d_ex_theater_02_40,Maybe the cat will show up later on?
d_ex_theater_02_41,Kind of a slow reveal...
d_ex_theater_02_42,"Anyway, we can keep watching."
d_ex_theater_02_43,Soon after.
d_ex_theater_02_44,"What was that, Commander?"
d_ex_theater_02_45,I didn't say anything.
d_ex_theater_02_46,Huh? Didn't you just whisper something in my ear?
d_ex_theater_02_47,No.
d_ex_theater_02_48,Oh... it must have been something from the movie. Sorry.
d_ex_theater_02_49,"In the movie's second act, the protagonist is convinced someone else is in the house and she wants to move out."
d_ex_theater_02_50,"But since they got such a great deal on the house, the other family members are reluctant to leave it behind."
d_ex_theater_02_51,The rift between the protagonist and her family becomes greater.
d_ex_theater_02_52,*Crash* *Woodadadada*
d_ex_theater_02_53,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh-!
d_ex_theater_02_54,...!
d_ex_theater_02_55,"Thanks, Commander. If you hadn't given me a heads up,"
d_ex_theater_02_56,that part would have made me scream for sure.
d_ex_theater_02_57,???
d_ex_theater_02_58,Didn't you just tell me a jump scare was coming up?
d_ex_theater_02_59,I didn't say anything.
d_ex_theater_02_60,Th-then what did I hear?
d_ex_theater_02_61,Could it be the movie again?
d_ex_theater_02_62,I-I don't think so... it sounded like it was right next to me...
d_ex_theater_02_63,"Then again, maybe it was just the movie. Sorry."
d_ex_theater_02_64,"As the plot continues, the unknown events become more intense,"
d_ex_theater_02_65,and some family members are even injured.
d_ex_theater_02_66,"Eventually, the protagonist is attacked by an unknown assailant and loses consciousness."
d_ex_theater_02_67,No! She has to stay awake!
d_ex_theater_02_68,This movie is too scary. Can you hold my hand?
d_ex_theater_02_69,I hold Admi's hand.
d_ex_theater_02_70,"Uh, C-Commander..."
d_ex_theater_02_71,Why are you...
d_ex_theater_02_72,Didn't you want me to hold your hand because you're scared?
d_ex_theater_02_73,I didn't say anything...
d_ex_theater_02_74,Oh... I must have misheard.
d_ex_theater_02_75,The protagonist wakes up in a basement bound with rope.
d_ex_theater_02_76,An unbelievable scene unfolds before her.
d_ex_theater_02_77,What is happening?
d_ex_theater_02_78,"Oh man, this is so scary!"
d_ex_theater_02_79,I'm going to sit between you two and watch it. It's too lonely over here.
d_ex_theater_02_80,Huh?
d_ex_theater_02_81,What is that?
d_ex_theater_02_82,Isn't it fun watching a movie together? Fun fun fun. I was so lonely before.
d_ex_theater_02_83,Admi and I look at each other. Our eyes meet.
d_ex_theater_02_84,Where are you looking? What you staring at? Where? Where? Where?
d_ex_theater_02_85,Let's watch together. Together. Together. Together. Together.
d_ex_theater_02_86,I'm lonely. So lonely. Lonely. Lonely.
d_ex_theater_02_87,C-Commander...
d_ex_theater_02_88,*Flinch*
d_ex_theater_02_89,Don't go. Don't go!
d_ex_theater_02_90,... I think we should get out of here.
d_ex_theater_02_91,Agreed.
d_ex_theater_02_92,Admi and I hurry out of the theater.
d_ex_theater_03_title,The Outsiders
d_ex_theater_03_1,"I went to the theater to enjoy a movie on my own,"
d_ex_theater_03_2,but there are several other people in the audience.
d_ex_theater_03_3,"*... Gasp, ugh! Ughh*"
d_ex_theater_03_4,*Let go of Penny. You might die*
d_ex_theater_03_5,*Just shut up. Someone might think I'm torturing you.*
d_ex_theater_03_6,*I'm just washing you hair. So dirty.*
d_ex_theater_03_7,"*Ugh, gasp*"
d_ex_theater_03_8,I sit down.
d_ex_theater_03_9,"Hi, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_theater_03_10,Never thought I'd run into you here of all places.
d_ex_theater_03_11,Crow?
d_ex_theater_03_12,Same goes for you.
d_ex_theater_03_13,Why are you so surprised?
d_ex_theater_03_14,"I can appreciate the finer things in life too, y'know?"
d_ex_theater_03_15,"Well... some of the time, anyhow."
d_ex_theater_03_16,I suppose that's true.
d_ex_theater_03_17,...
d_ex_theater_03_18,Do you like watching movies?
d_ex_theater_03_19,"No, not really."
d_ex_theater_03_20,"But for whatever reason, this movie pops into my head every year."
d_ex_theater_03_21,So I always come see it. Kind of an annual event if you will.
d_ex_theater_03_22,What's it about?
d_ex_theater_03_23,It's the story of these poor young gangsters.
d_ex_theater_03_24,"A rival gang called The Plutocrats are about to kill the protagonist,"
d_ex_theater_03_25,when his friend...
d_ex_theater_03_26,*Bang*
d_ex_theater_03_27,"Oh, he just killed one of them."
d_ex_theater_03_28,Is this the climax already?
d_ex_theater_03_29,"Nah, this is still just the intro."
d_ex_theater_03_30,*...You ki-killed him?! You actually killed him?*
d_ex_theater_03_31,*Don't turn yourself in. Let's get out of here.*
d_ex_theater_03_32,"They run away, and live a life on the run."
d_ex_theater_03_33,The second act of a down-and-out criminal's life.
d_ex_theater_03_34,That's what this movie is all about.
d_ex_theater_03_35,What makes you want to see this movie every year?
d_ex_theater_03_36,Not sure. I've never really given it much thought.
d_ex_theater_03_37,I guess it gives me... a sense of hope.
d_ex_theater_03_38,This was filmed before the Rapture invasion.
d_ex_theater_03_39,"It's a window into a better world, a world before the Outer Rim."
d_ex_theater_03_40,There aren't any walled-off cities in this movie.
d_ex_theater_03_41,And it shows there's always the possibility of escape.
d_ex_theater_03_42,Not to mention the bond they share.
d_ex_theater_03_43,Outlaws today would have just shot each other over some petty squabble.
d_ex_theater_03_44,Nothing heroic like the protagonist running away with his best friend who saved him.
d_ex_theater_03_45,...
d_ex_theater_03_46,"*John, there's an abandoned church at the next village.*"
d_ex_theater_03_47,*You and Penny can hide there for a while.*
d_ex_theater_03_48,"See, even now."
d_ex_theater_03_49,The strongest guy from the gang is taking care of the protagonist.
d_ex_theater_03_50,"If that was now, he'd be turning him in for the bounty."
d_ex_theater_03_51,How are your friends?
d_ex_theater_03_52,Depends on who you're talking about.
d_ex_theater_03_53,My squad? Or Heavenly Ascension?
d_ex_theater_03_54,Your squad.
d_ex_theater_03_55,Heavenly Ascension.
d_ex_theater_03_56,Jackal is a special case.
d_ex_theater_03_57,"I could kill someone today, and she'd come running to save me."
d_ex_theater_03_58,But Viper...
d_ex_theater_03_59,She'd stab me in the back the moment she had a chance.
d_ex_theater_03_60,Just like any other outlaw.
d_ex_theater_03_61,They all worship me.
d_ex_theater_03_62,"As long as I rule them with an iron fist, they'll fall in line."
d_ex_theater_03_63,"If I allowed any cracks to appear,"
d_ex_theater_03_64,they'd tear me limb from limb and sell the parts to the highest bidder.
d_ex_theater_03_65,I can't even blame them.
d_ex_theater_03_66,I'd do the same thing.
d_ex_theater_03_67,"It's a bit ironic, don't you think?"
d_ex_theater_03_68,That's sad.
d_ex_theater_03_69,What is?
d_ex_theater_03_70,Being envious of the protagonist in a tragedy.
d_ex_theater_03_71,Not being able to trust your closest allies.
d_ex_theater_03_72,Hm?
d_ex_theater_03_73,"... Oh, haha."
d_ex_theater_03_74,You've got it all wrong.
d_ex_theater_03_75,I'm not holding a pity party here.
d_ex_theater_03_76,Movies aren't real life.
d_ex_theater_03_77,You can't expect the values of one to be like the other.
d_ex_theater_03_78,Imagine a movie where these innocent little kids
d_ex_theater_03_79,are running around giggling and gleefully planting bombs.
d_ex_theater_03_80,I'd be the first one to give the director a piece of my mind.
d_ex_theater_03_81,I'd tell him why the hell did he waste my time with such a ludicrous plot.
d_ex_theater_03_82,"But if you take the same activity and make it my job, then I think it's fantastic."
d_ex_theater_03_83,...
d_ex_theater_03_84,Why are you laughing?
d_ex_theater_03_85,Take a guess.
d_ex_theater_03_86,Just picturing that imaginary director in my head.
d_ex_theater_03_87,"Anyway, that's not what I wanted to say."
d_ex_theater_03_88,Some people are weirdos. They're naturally drawn to characters
d_ex_theater_03_89,that are diametrically opposite to them.
d_ex_theater_03_90,...
d_ex_theater_03_91,"Come to think of it, it's kinda rude for us to be talking so much in a theater."
d_ex_theater_03_92,We should keep quiet
d_ex_theater_03_93,and just
d_ex_theater_03_94,enjoy the movie.
d_ex_theater_04_title,A Self-Deprecating Audience
d_ex_theater_04_1,I went to the theater alone to take in a show.
d_ex_theater_04_2,...??
d_ex_theater_04_3,There is someone on the stage.
d_ex_theater_04_4,Looks like it's Noise and Diesel.
d_ex_theater_04_5,Try it again.
d_ex_theater_04_6,My→love→you↗have→been↗far→away↗
d_ex_theater_04_7,My↘love↗you→have↘been→far↗away↘
d_ex_theater_04_8,...
d_ex_theater_04_9,How's that? I think I've got this down.
d_ex_theater_04_10,I think Soline is going to clean your clock.
d_ex_theater_04_11,Your high notes need some work. Let's try it again.
d_ex_theater_04_12,My→love→you↗have→been↗far→away↗
d_ex_theater_04_13,My↗love↗you↗have↗been↗far↗away↗↗↗
d_ex_theater_04_14,...
d_ex_theater_04_15,They seem to be practicing singing.
d_ex_theater_04_16,What are you doing?
d_ex_theater_04_17,Ssh!
d_ex_theater_04_18,Crow?
d_ex_theater_04_19,Sit down.
d_ex_theater_04_20,Don't you know proper concert-going etiquette? Keep your voice down.
d_ex_theater_04_21,I sit down beside Crow and lower my voice.
d_ex_theater_04_22,What are you doing here?
d_ex_theater_04_23,Can't you see? I'm enjoying the music.
d_ex_theater_04_24,The→everlasting→love↘
d_ex_theater_04_25,The↗everlasting↘love↗
d_ex_theater_04_26,Much better than before. One more time.
d_ex_theater_04_27,The→everlasting→ love↘
d_ex_theater_04_28,"I came to see a proper show, but then I saw the two of them practicing singing."
d_ex_theater_04_29,"They're so wrapped up in it that they haven't noticed me, so I've just been sitting here quietly."
d_ex_theater_04_30,Whenever→you→are↗sad↗
d_ex_theater_04_31,Whenever↗you↘are↘sad↗
d_ex_theater_04_32,Hmm...
d_ex_theater_04_33,What do you think?
d_ex_theater_04_34,What exactly are you here for?
d_ex_theater_04_35,What do you mean?
d_ex_theater_04_36,You shouldn't deride someone who's trying their best.
d_ex_theater_04_37,I'm doing nothing of the sort!
d_ex_theater_04_38,"If anything, you're the one who's belittling them."
d_ex_theater_04_39,...
d_ex_theater_04_40,"When you look up there, what do you see?"
d_ex_theater_04_41,Someone is helping another overcome her personal flaws.
d_ex_theater_04_42,"Would you say that's inherently comedic,"
d_ex_theater_04_43,or tragic?
d_ex_theater_04_44,How about you?
d_ex_theater_04_45,It's rude to answer a question with another question.
d_ex_theater_04_46,...
d_ex_theater_04_47,I'm just a bystander.
d_ex_theater_04_48,It doesn't matter to me whether it's a comedy or a tragedy.
d_ex_theater_04_49,I'm just sitting in the audience and watching.
d_ex_theater_04_50,So I can't answer your question.
d_ex_theater_04_51,But I do know one thing though.
d_ex_theater_04_52,I can't do what those two do.
d_ex_theater_04_53,Let's go over it one more time.
d_ex_theater_04_54,My→love→you↗have→been↗far→away↗
d_ex_theater_04_55,My→love→you↗have→been↗far→away↗
d_ex_theater_04_56,Well done! You did it!
d_ex_theater_04_57,Really? Let's keep going!
d_ex_theater_04_58,Okay.
d_ex_theater_04_59,... Haha.
d_ex_theater_04_60,"No, definitely not for me."
d_ex_tower_01_title,Getting a Signal
d_ex_tower_01_1,Hmm...
d_ex_tower_01_2,"So, this is the place"
d_ex_tower_01_3,with the best signal?
d_ex_tower_01_4,Yes.
d_ex_tower_01_5,Novel said she couldn't make it due to work.
d_ex_tower_01_6,I better download Final Quest quickly.
d_ex_tower_01_7,The daily quest will be over any minute.
d_ex_tower_01_8,*Knock knock*
d_ex_tower_01_9,??
d_ex_tower_01_10,Who is it?
d_ex_tower_01_11,Small sounds were coming from the door.
d_ex_tower_01_12,Uh... is anyone there?
d_ex_tower_01_13,Signal?
d_ex_tower_01_14,!!
d_ex_tower_01_15,C-Commander! You're here too?
d_ex_tower_01_16,I can feel Exia rush and hide behind me.
d_ex_tower_01_17,I-I have a favor to ask...
d_ex_tower_01_18,Can I come in?
d_ex_tower_01_19,Exia shakes her head.
d_ex_tower_01_20,She said no.
d_ex_tower_01_21,!!!
d_ex_tower_01_22,Oh... really?
d_ex_tower_01_23,"S-sure, no problem. I understand if you don't want me coming inside..."
d_ex_tower_01_24,Um... is it okay if I talk to you from outside the door then?
d_ex_tower_01_25,Exia nods.
d_ex_tower_01_26,She said yes.
d_ex_tower_01_27,"Ah, well that's good..."
d_ex_tower_01_28,What's the matter?
d_ex_tower_01_29,"Well, it's just..."
d_ex_tower_01_30,the TV isn't working.
d_ex_tower_01_31,I can't hear you.
d_ex_tower_01_32,I said the TV isn't working!
d_ex_tower_01_33,Do you know how to fix it?
d_ex_tower_01_34,Is it not turning on?
d_ex_tower_01_35,"No, it turns on, but..."
d_ex_tower_01_36,I'm not getting any reception.
d_ex_tower_01_37,I thought I might have better luck in the tower...
d_ex_tower_01_38,Are you trying to watch Midwinter Night's Dream?
d_ex_tower_01_39,H-how did you...!
d_ex_tower_01_40,"Judging by how anxious you are,"
d_ex_tower_01_41,that tells me you want to watch something that's going to air soon.
d_ex_tower_01_42,And the hottest show on the air right now
d_ex_tower_01_43,is Midwinter Night's Dream.
d_ex_tower_01_44,It's got everyone hooked.
d_ex_tower_01_45,It's the only explanation.
d_ex_tower_01_46,"Wow, you got it!"
d_ex_tower_01_47,"Just some simple deduction, that's all."
d_ex_tower_01_48,...
d_ex_tower_01_49,"By the way, when you watch a show, do you watch it quietly?"
d_ex_tower_01_50,Huh?
d_ex_tower_01_51,Or are you one of those people that hoots and hollers in order to get into it?
d_ex_tower_01_52,"I-I just sit and watch, nothing special..."
d_ex_tower_01_53,"In that case, you can bring the TV in here and watch."
d_ex_tower_01_54,!!
d_ex_tower_01_55,Really?
d_ex_tower_01_56,Exia nods.
d_ex_tower_01_57,She said yes.
d_ex_tower_01_58,Th-thank you! I'll go get the TV!
d_ex_tower_01_59,I hear Signal running away.
d_ex_tower_01_60,Are you sure you're okay with it?
d_ex_tower_01_61,"Yeah, it's fine."
d_ex_tower_01_62,Can't leave a fangirl
d_ex_tower_01_63,in distress hanging.
d_ex_tower_01_64,I suppose you're right.
d_ex_tower_01_65,"A bit later, Signal comes back with a small TV."
d_ex_tower_01_66,She thanks us profusely and sits down in the corner
d_ex_tower_01_67,"to watch the popular TV show, Midwinter Night's Dream."
d_ex_tower_01_68,*sh... shhh... Shhhh*
d_ex_tower_01_69,She holds her breath.
d_ex_tower_01_70,...
d_ex_tower_01_71,...
d_ex_tower_01_72,Hey.
d_ex_tower_01_73,"Remind her to breathe, will you?"
d_ex_tower_01_74,!!
d_ex_tower_01_75,"Oh, whoops! Thanks for reminding me!"
d_ex_tower_01_76,No problem.
d_ex_tower_01_77,Hehe...
d_ex_tower_01_78,It was a fun afternoon.
d_ex_tower_02_title,Release the Dimension
d_ex_tower_02_1,I found a strange note in my room.
d_ex_tower_02_2,"Radio tower, dimensional nucleus generation. Requires 3 who are Chosen. Cooperation request."
d_ex_tower_02_3,I headed straight for the radio tower as soon as my assignment was complete.
d_ex_tower_02_4,*Beep*
d_ex_tower_02_5,It's about time
d_ex_tower_02_6,you got here.
d_ex_tower_02_7,Hello Teacher!
d_ex_tower_02_8,Just what exactly is going on here?
d_ex_tower_02_9,"Finally, the last Chosen one is here."
d_ex_tower_02_10,"With this, all three members of Fatality have gathered."
d_ex_tower_02_11,This is where all dimensions and worldlines intersect.
d_ex_tower_02_12,What we know simply as the radio tower is in fact a...
d_ex_tower_02_13,Dimensional Clock Tower.
d_ex_tower_02_14,"In the end, you have succeeded in occupying this clock tower."
d_ex_tower_02_15,My powers are becoming more and more frightening. I scarcely know their limits!
d_ex_tower_02_16,"N102, what are you doing here?"
d_ex_tower_02_17,I was...
d_ex_tower_02_18,Well...
d_ex_tower_02_19,"I'm not sure if you know, but I had lost my memory..."
d_ex_tower_02_20,...!
d_ex_tower_02_21,"But thanks to Guillotine de Mephisto, everything is clear to me."
d_ex_tower_02_22,I am from another dimension.
d_ex_tower_02_23,"When I came to this dimension, the world line was distorted and caused me to lose my memory."
d_ex_tower_02_24,"So, in this dimension's clock tower..."
d_ex_tower_02_25,Um...
d_ex_tower_02_26,"Actually, I didn't quite grasp all of it. Anyway, Guillotine de Mephisto is helping me out!"
d_ex_tower_02_27,...
d_ex_tower_02_28,"You are correct, Lou Memoria, aka N102."
d_ex_tower_02_29,It is here where we can ascertain clues to the dimension from whence you came.
d_ex_tower_02_30,"Since this is a dimensional clock tower,"
d_ex_tower_02_31,you should be able to communicate with your friends beyond this dimension.
d_ex_tower_02_32,"Yes, ma'am!"
d_ex_tower_02_33,But activating this tower will require a significant amount of energy.
d_ex_tower_02_34,"First, I must draw the magic circle."
d_ex_tower_02_35,Stand back for a moment.
d_ex_tower_02_36,Guillotine takes some chalk out of her pocket and starts drawing a magic circle on the floor.
d_ex_tower_02_37,"N102, could you show me your notebook?"
d_ex_tower_02_38,What? I can't do that!
d_ex_tower_02_39,This notebook is the key to activating the clock tower.
d_ex_tower_02_40,"Until then, I was told to keep it sealed, never to be opened."
d_ex_tower_02_41,Sorry...
d_ex_tower_02_42,... It's okay.
d_ex_tower_02_43,*Tak- Taktak Tak*
d_ex_tower_02_44,"This is by no means a simple procedure, so the composition of the magic circle is rather complicated."
d_ex_tower_02_45,"Finally, it is complete."
d_ex_tower_02_46,"Lou Memoria, do you still have the sealed notebook in your possession?"
d_ex_tower_02_47,Yes! It's right here!
d_ex_tower_02_48,"Very good, then our preparations are complete."
d_ex_tower_02_49,Release the seal on the notebook and place it in the center of the magic circle.
d_ex_tower_02_50,Yes!
d_ex_tower_02_51,Releasing seal... Now!
d_ex_tower_02_52,N102 lays the notebook in the center of the magic circle.
d_ex_tower_02_53,The notebook lies open. On the left page is information about Guillotine de Mephisto as well as what seems to be information about other worlds and dimensions
d_ex_tower_02_54,"On the right page, there is a picture that resembles the magic circle drawn on the floor."
d_ex_tower_02_55,"Now, let us each stand on the edge of the magic circle."
d_ex_tower_02_56,We must condense all of our strength into the notebook.
d_ex_tower_02_57,Let the ceremony begin.
d_ex_tower_02_58,Guillotine stretches out one hand toward the notebook.
d_ex_tower_02_59,"I, Guillotine de Mephisto, commander of"
d_ex_tower_02_60,"time and space, demand you"
d_ex_tower_02_61,to free the dimension of Lou Memoria!
d_ex_tower_02_62,Release the dimension!
d_ex_tower_02_63,Release the dimension!
d_ex_tower_02_64,Release the dimension!
d_ex_tower_02_65,...
d_ex_tower_02_66,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
d_ex_tower_02_67,Are you going to abandon Lou Memoria like this?
d_ex_tower_02_68,Recite the incantation!
d_ex_tower_02_69,Release the dimension!
d_ex_tower_02_70,*Zaaap*
d_ex_tower_02_71,...!
d_ex_tower_02_72,Did it succeed?
d_ex_tower_02_73,"*Zaap, Zaaaap*"
d_ex_tower_02_74,"A massive spark shoots out, then subsides."
d_ex_tower_02_75,It failed...
d_ex_tower_02_76,But we mustn't give up.
d_ex_tower_02_77,I hadn't planned on using this...
d_ex_tower_02_78,*Beep*
d_ex_tower_02_79,Give me a moment to check my messages.
m_ex_tower_02_1,Hi.
m_ex_tower_02_2,I caught all that on CCTV.
m_ex_tower_02_3,Hehehe...
m_ex_tower_02_4,I figured creating that spark would be a nice touch.
m_ex_tower_02_5,Novel is on her way.
m_ex_tower_02_6,I suggest you hightail it out of there
m_ex_tower_02_7,before getting tangled up in all that mess.
d_ex_tower_02_80,Let us continue with the ceremony.
d_ex_tower_02_81,The Big O is heading this way.
d_ex_tower_02_82,Novel will be here soon.
d_ex_tower_02_83,We have to cover our tracks.
d_ex_tower_02_84,I'm on it!
d_ex_tower_02_85,"What?! Damn, they already found out?"
d_ex_tower_02_86,"I'm sorry Lou Memoria, this is all because I'm not strong enough."
d_ex_tower_02_87,Next time I will let you communicate with your friends.
d_ex_tower_02_88,It's okay!
d_ex_tower_02_89,You're both my friends too!
d_ex_tower_02_90,So I'm not alone.
d_ex_tower_02_91,My... my eye...
d_ex_tower_02_92,What is this warm feeling?
d_ex_tower_02_93,Is this... what they call emotion?
d_ex_tower_02_94,Hehe!
d_ex_tower_02_95,"N102, you look happy."
d_ex_tower_02_96,I am! Today is the best day ever!
d_ex_tower_02_97,Let's clean up and hurry back.
d_ex_tower_02_98,"Together, we clear all trace of the ceremony and leave the radio tower."
d_ex_tower_03_title,Soldier and Teen
d_ex_tower_03_1,"Hey everybody! Didn't keep you waiting too long, did I?"
d_ex_tower_03_2,I wasn't getting any signal so I'm here at the radio tower.
d_ex_tower_03_3,"Fortunately, it seems there's a strong signal here."
d_ex_tower_03_4,Also...
d_ex_tower_03_5,our Coach is here!
d_ex_tower_03_6,What are you doing?
d_ex_tower_03_7,"Hello, everyone."
d_ex_tower_03_8,It's called T-Live.
d_ex_tower_03_9,You can livestream with just a cellphone.
d_ex_tower_03_10,I'm doing a stream for my fans.
d_ex_tower_03_11,"You're not leaving anything out, are you?"
d_ex_tower_03_12,... Anyways.
d_ex_tower_03_13,The fans are happy to see you.
d_ex_tower_03_14,"We have more than 10,000 teenage viewers watching us right now."
d_ex_tower_03_15,"Why don't you give them a show, Coach?"
d_ex_tower_03_16,"You can borrow my board,"
d_ex_tower_03_17,or maybe perform a song and dance?
d_ex_tower_03_18,Give the people what they want!
d_ex_tower_03_19,Can't back out now. What should I do?
d_ex_tower_03_20,Dance.
d_ex_tower_03_21,Show them a skateboard trick.
d_ex_tower_03_22,*Boom~ boom~*
d_ex_tower_03_23,Epinel drops a beat and I start dancing.
d_ex_tower_03_24,Um...
d_ex_tower_03_25,"I don't mean to be rude, but..."
d_ex_tower_03_26,are you impersonating a Rapture?
d_ex_tower_03_27,*Rattle rattle*
d_ex_tower_03_28,I ride the skateboard in the narrow hallway.
d_ex_tower_03_29,*Bang*
d_ex_tower_03_30,*Crash! Smash*
d_ex_tower_03_31,Um...
d_ex_tower_03_32,I assume crashing into a wall wasn't part of the trick?
d_ex_tower_03_33,No.
d_ex_tower_03_34,Figured.
d_ex_tower_03_35,"Sorry, I shouldn't have pressured you into doing anything."
d_ex_tower_03_36,No need to apologize.
d_ex_tower_03_37,*Beep*
d_ex_tower_03_38,Commander? Epinel?
d_ex_tower_03_39,What are you guys doing at the radio tower?
d_ex_tower_03_40,I'm doing a T-Live. I came here since I wasn't getting a good signal.
d_ex_tower_03_41,T-Live? Is that like a live stream?
d_ex_tower_03_42,Pretty much. I'm doing a stream for my fans.
d_ex_tower_03_43,"We just passed 10,000 viewers."
d_ex_tower_03_44,"Since you're here, care to show the people something?"
d_ex_tower_03_45,Coach gave it a shot... but didn't do so hot.
d_ex_tower_03_46,Is that so?
d_ex_tower_03_47,"All right then, since the Commander left everybody hanging"
d_ex_tower_03_48,I'll give it the old college try!
d_ex_tower_03_49,I wasn't that bad...
d_ex_tower_03_50,"All right, I'm sure everyone's excited to see it!"
d_ex_tower_03_51,Then can you show us some of your skills?
d_ex_tower_03_52,"Sure, I'll show you three things I'm really good at."
d_ex_tower_03_53,First is something I've been working on throughout my enlistment.
d_ex_tower_03_54,Firearm Maintenance.
d_ex_tower_03_55,I can disassemble any weapon in under 4 seconds.
d_ex_tower_03_56,"*Click, click*"
d_ex_tower_03_57,Polish with a towel for another 4 seconds.
d_ex_tower_03_58,*Squeak squeak*
d_ex_tower_03_59,Another 4 seconds to reassemble...
d_ex_tower_03_60,"Click, click."
d_ex_tower_03_61,"and there you have it. Pretty neat, huh?"
d_ex_tower_03_62,...
d_ex_tower_03_63,"Maybe, but something tells me Epinel's fans aren't interested in that sort of thing."
d_ex_tower_03_64,They aren't?
d_ex_tower_03_65,Yeah... it might be better if you can show us something else.
d_ex_tower_03_66,Something that appeals more to teens.
d_ex_tower_03_67,"Gotcha, loud and clear."
d_ex_tower_03_68,"They'll eat this one up, I'm sure of it."
d_ex_tower_03_69,What is it?
d_ex_tower_03_70,While on the battlefield...
d_ex_tower_03_71,I can consume any type of food within 4 seconds.
d_ex_tower_03_72,Why are you so obsessed with 4 seconds?
d_ex_tower_03_73,We're not even on the battlefield...
d_ex_tower_03_74,It's simple.
d_ex_tower_03_75,"3 seconds is too short and 5 seconds is too long,"
d_ex_tower_03_76,but 4 seconds is juuuuust right.
d_ex_tower_03_77,We're not even on the battlefield...
d_ex_tower_03_78,...
d_ex_tower_03_79,Oh yeah... guess you're right.
d_ex_tower_03_80,"Well, onto number three it is."
d_ex_tower_03_81,"In under 4 seconds, I can take any heavy weapon and..."
d_ex_tower_03_82,Wait.
d_ex_tower_03_83,I said something that teens might like!
d_ex_tower_03_84,"You know, like singing or dancing."
d_ex_tower_03_85,!!
d_ex_tower_03_86,"Oh... um, okay."
d_ex_tower_03_87,You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
d_ex_tower_03_88,It's okay.
d_ex_tower_03_89,I promised I would make up for your failure.
d_ex_tower_03_90,I can't back down now.
d_ex_tower_03_91,"Well then, for my final act, I'll... sing a song."
d_ex_tower_03_92,"But my throat is a bit sore, so I'll whistle instead."
d_ex_tower_03_93,You can just imagine that I'm singing.
d_ex_tower_03_94,"So, erm... here I go."
d_ex_tower_03_95,Ph-Ph Phwwwwhht~♪
d_ex_tower_03_96,Ph Phwwwwhht Phwwwhht♪ Phwwwwhht Phwwwhht♪
d_ex_tower_03_97,Attteeeeenntion!
d_ex_tower_03_98,"Left, left, left, right left!"
d_ex_tower_03_99,Ph-Ph Phwwwwhht~♪
d_ex_tower_03_100,Stop.
d_ex_tower_03_101,Just... what was that?!
d_ex_tower_03_102,Since when were teenagers fans of military cadence calls?
d_ex_tower_03_103,"Stop, I'm begging you. You're giving me PTSD."
d_ex_tower_03_104,"Oh, well..."
d_ex_tower_03_105,"since teens are so full of energy,"
d_ex_tower_03_106,I thought they might appreciate the power behind it...
d_ex_tower_03_107,But...
d_ex_tower_03_108,These drills are so full of energy! They're the best the military has to offer!
d_ex_tower_03_109,I feel like standing at attention just listening to them!
d_ex_tower_03_110,No.
d_ex_tower_03_111,Huh?
d_ex_tower_03_112,This wasn't what I was asking for...
d_ex_tower_03_113,*Slam*
d_ex_tower_03_114,...
d_ex_tower_03_115,I just don't get kids these days.
d_ex_tower_03_116,They all throw a fit whenever they're displeased with something.
d_ex_tower_03_117,This is a big problem.
d_ex_tower_03_118,I think the problem lies more with you.
d_ex_toyshop_01_title,Children's Playdate
d_ex_toyshop_01_1,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_01_2,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_01_3,"Ah! It's you, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_4,Good to see you! Who's that behind you?
d_ex_toyshop_01_5,What are you staring at?!
d_ex_toyshop_01_6,Never seen a Nikke before?
d_ex_toyshop_01_7,"Oh my, it's a child!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_8,Hey! Who're you calling a child!
d_ex_toyshop_01_9,You're probably younger than me!
d_ex_toyshop_01_10,"You're right, I am a child!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_11,It's always nice to meet a fellow youngster!
d_ex_toyshop_01_12,"I told you, I'm not a kid!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_13,What kind of customer service is this?
d_ex_toyshop_01_14,Haven't you had any staff training?
d_ex_toyshop_01_15,Not me!
d_ex_toyshop_01_16,What's staff training?
d_ex_toyshop_01_17,Wait... you haven't?
d_ex_toyshop_01_18,But... but that...
d_ex_toyshop_01_19,Soline seems confused.
d_ex_toyshop_01_20,It means being polite to the customers.
d_ex_toyshop_01_21,"Ah, I get it now."
d_ex_toyshop_01_22,So our little friend wants the staff to be nice?
d_ex_toyshop_01_23,"I like nice people, too!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_24,...
d_ex_toyshop_01_25,Are you pulling my leg right now?
d_ex_toyshop_01_26,I'm leaving.
d_ex_toyshop_01_27,"Hey, don't go!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_28,Why don't you stay a while?
d_ex_toyshop_01_29,We can have fun together!
d_ex_toyshop_01_30,"I'll stop teasing, promise."
d_ex_toyshop_01_31,Really?
d_ex_toyshop_01_32,Really!
d_ex_toyshop_01_33,Really?
d_ex_toyshop_01_34,"Don't you believe me, Mica?"
d_ex_toyshop_01_35,Sure I believe you!
d_ex_toyshop_01_36,"So, what sells best here?"
d_ex_toyshop_01_37,The most popular thing in the shop? That would be...
d_ex_toyshop_01_38,Nothing!
d_ex_toyshop_01_39,Nothing?
d_ex_toyshop_01_40,Yep. No one ever buys anything...
d_ex_toyshop_01_41,!!
d_ex_toyshop_01_42,Not a single customer.
d_ex_toyshop_01_43,"Hey, come on! Chin up!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_44,H-how about I buy something?
d_ex_toyshop_01_45,Really? Will you be our customer?
d_ex_toyshop_01_46,Hehe. Thank you.
d_ex_toyshop_01_47,Right this way then. Let me show you something really neat.
d_ex_toyshop_01_48,"You stay here for a bit, Old-Timer."
d_ex_toyshop_01_49,... All right.
d_ex_toyshop_01_50,Soline follows Belorta inside the shop.
d_ex_toyshop_01_51,"Gah, you scared me! What is this thing coming from a box?!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_52,"Belorta, you said you wouldn't surprise her..."
d_ex_toyshop_01_53,Gah! The ground is gonna cave in!
d_ex_toyshop_01_54,Hehehe! Isn't this fun?
d_ex_toyshop_01_55,Maybe for you!
d_ex_toyshop_01_56,Yeesh!
d_ex_toyshop_01_57,More noise comes from inside the shop.
d_ex_toyshop_01_58,...
d_ex_toyshop_01_59,A few moments later.
d_ex_toyshop_01_60,Snakes popping out of a gift box...
d_ex_toyshop_01_61,The ground giving way when I go to see a doll..
d_ex_toyshop_01_62,"This is no toy shop, it's just a prank shop!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_63,No wonder you all can't sell anything!
d_ex_toyshop_01_64,But didn't you have fun?
d_ex_toyshop_01_65,Not at all!
d_ex_toyshop_01_66,I'm never coming back here!
d_ex_toyshop_01_67,Never?
d_ex_toyshop_01_68,Never!
d_ex_toyshop_01_69,"I... I understand. If you don't like us, that's fine."
d_ex_toyshop_01_70,I was so happy to finally have a friend...
d_ex_toyshop_01_71,"Huh? Hey, what are you so down for?"
d_ex_toyshop_01_72,I'm sorry. I didn't know you would hate it this much.
d_ex_toyshop_01_73,Um... hey... don't beat yourself up too much.
d_ex_toyshop_01_74,I dunno... maybe I'll come back sometime.
d_ex_toyshop_01_75,Really? Thank you!
d_ex_toyshop_01_76,"Thank you, Soline!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_77,"Jeez, you're easy to please..."
d_ex_toyshop_01_78,Well... I'll be going then. See you later... or maybe not. I don't know.
d_ex_toyshop_01_79,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_01_80,Soline leaves.
d_ex_toyshop_01_81,"Wow, a new friend!"
d_ex_toyshop_01_82,We finally have someone else to prank other than Mica!
d_ex_toyshop_01_83,Huh? Prank? Who?
d_ex_toyshop_01_84,"Never mind, it's nothing."
d_ex_toyshop_01_85,... I feel bad for Soline.
d_ex_toyshop_01_86,Feel bad? How come? Being friends is a good thing!
d_ex_toyshop_01_87,Right! Friends are great!
d_ex_toyshop_01_88,...
d_ex_toyshop_01_89,I pity Soline for what she is about to go through.
d_ex_toyshop_02_title,The Haunted House
d_ex_toyshop_02_1,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_02_2,"Hey there, Old-Timer."
d_ex_toyshop_02_3,"Hello, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_toyshop_02_4,"The shop is dimly lit, and eerie music is playing softly."
d_ex_toyshop_02_5,"There is a mannequin dressed as a ghost, and the toys are displayed haphazardly."
d_ex_toyshop_02_6,Did you turn the place into a haunted house?
d_ex_toyshop_02_7,"Yeah, we were bored, so we thought we'd do some redecorating."
d_ex_toyshop_02_8,"What do you think? Pretty creepy, right?"
d_ex_toyshop_02_9,I feel like a ghost is going to pop out and get me.
d_ex_toyshop_02_10,Nice! Mica and I worked hard on it.
d_ex_toyshop_02_11,"It wasn't easy, but I'm proud of it."
d_ex_toyshop_02_12,Now you can help us out.
d_ex_toyshop_02_13,How can I help?
d_ex_toyshop_02_14,"Since it's a haunted house and all, I want you to dress up as something scary!"
d_ex_toyshop_02_15,I'll do it.
d_ex_toyshop_02_16,Woo-hoo! Thanks! What kind of costume would you like to wear?
d_ex_toyshop_02_17,A grim reaper.
d_ex_toyshop_02_18,A goblin.
d_ex_toyshop_02_19,That should suit you perfectly!
d_ex_toyshop_02_20,I'll go get the grim reaper costume.
d_ex_toyshop_02_21,That should suit you perfectly!
d_ex_toyshop_02_22,I'll go get the goblin costume.
d_ex_toyshop_02_23,"Um, Belorta... we don't have a goblin costume."
d_ex_toyshop_02_24,Oh... no worries. You'll just have to be the grim reaper then!
d_ex_toyshop_02_25,Okay.
d_ex_toyshop_02_26,A moment later.
d_ex_toyshop_02_27,Tah-dah!
d_ex_toyshop_02_28,"Wow, you really do look like the grim reaper!"
d_ex_toyshop_02_29,I'm scared you're gonna get me!
d_ex_toyshop_02_30,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_02_31,Is this it...?
d_ex_toyshop_02_32,"It can't be, this is a toy store..."
d_ex_toyshop_02_33,Commander? What are you doing here?
d_ex_toyshop_02_34,Just helping out.
d_ex_toyshop_02_35,You don't look so good...
d_ex_toyshop_02_36,Your face is all white...
d_ex_toyshop_02_37,I'm dressed as the grim reaper.
d_ex_toyshop_02_38,"Oh, that explains it! You really pull it off."
d_ex_toyshop_02_39,"Anyway, do you guys happen to have this limited edition figu..."
d_ex_toyshop_02_40,???
d_ex_toyshop_02_41,Wait a sec...
d_ex_toyshop_02_42,That's it!!
d_ex_toyshop_02_43,"Full of excitement, Maiden rushes towards a figurine in the toy store."
d_ex_toyshop_02_44,I can't believe I found this here...
d_ex_toyshop_02_45,Are you talking about this one?
d_ex_toyshop_02_46,You plan on buying it?
d_ex_toyshop_02_47,Of course! This is a limited edition figurine!
d_ex_toyshop_02_48,Do you know how hard it is to find this?
d_ex_toyshop_02_49,I'm afraid that's for display only. It's not for sale.
d_ex_toyshop_02_50,What do I need to do to make you change your mind?
d_ex_toyshop_02_51,Pitch in with our haunted house.
d_ex_toyshop_02_52,Huh?!
d_ex_toyshop_02_53,"That's right. As you can see, we worked our butts off turning the toy shop into a haunted house."
d_ex_toyshop_02_54,"I want you to dress up, then hide and surprise any customers that come in."
d_ex_toyshop_02_55,"If you do that, the figurine is all yours."
d_ex_toyshop_02_56,I don't know... Sounds like a lot...
d_ex_toyshop_02_57,"Fine, I'll do it."
d_ex_toyshop_02_58,Excellent! What should we dress her up as?
d_ex_toyshop_02_59,A creepy ghost girl.
d_ex_toyshop_02_60,An egg ghost.
d_ex_toyshop_02_61,"Actually, she already looks pretty scary as is. I don't think we even need to give her a costume."
d_ex_toyshop_02_62,"Yeah, she's already super freaky!"
d_ex_toyshop_02_63,Is... that a compliment?
d_ex_toyshop_02_64,Yes! You fit perfectly with the haunted house.
d_ex_toyshop_02_65,"Hide here under the table. When a customer arrives, you can give them a good scare."
d_ex_toyshop_02_66,Got it.
d_ex_toyshop_02_67,Maiden heads under the table and gets in position.
d_ex_toyshop_02_68,"Wow, it's actually pretty comfortable down here."
d_ex_toyshop_02_69,A moment later.
d_ex_toyshop_02_70,Where are all the customers?
d_ex_toyshop_02_71,"Don't worry, they'll come soon."
d_ex_toyshop_02_72,3 hours later.
d_ex_toyshop_02_73,Are you sure anyone is coming?
d_ex_toyshop_02_74,"Aw man... After all that work, no one's gonna even show up..."
d_ex_toyshop_02_75,How long do I have to stay here?
d_ex_toyshop_02_76,5 hours later.
d_ex_toyshop_02_77,...
d_ex_toyshop_02_78,"Hmm, seems like a slow day."
d_ex_toyshop_02_79,8 hours later.
d_ex_toyshop_02_80,It's time to close the shop.
d_ex_toyshop_02_81,"Jeez, not even a single person..."
d_ex_toyshop_02_82,That's okay! We'll try again another day.
d_ex_toyshop_02_83,"Maiden, you can come out now."
d_ex_toyshop_02_84,...
d_ex_toyshop_02_85,Huh? Maiden fell asleep!
d_ex_toyshop_02_86,"When we all look under the table, we see Maiden crouched down, fast asleep."
d_ex_toyshop_02_87,"Huh, she fell asleep."
d_ex_toyshop_02_88,How unprofessional! There's no way we can sell her that figurine now.
d_ex_toyshop_02_89,"In the end, Maiden was not able to obtain the limited edition figurine."
d_ex_toyshop_02_90,"From a distance, people could hear her screams from inside the toy shop."
d_ex_toyshop_03_title,Strawberry Candy Shop
d_ex_toyshop_03_1,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_03_2,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_03_3,Diesel?
d_ex_toyshop_03_4,"Oh, hey Commander. What are you doing here?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_5,I should ask you the same thing.
d_ex_toyshop_03_6,Fair enough.
d_ex_toyshop_03_7,"I dropped by to look at some toys, but"
d_ex_toyshop_03_8,Belorta and Mica ended up asking me to watch the store for a bit.
d_ex_toyshop_03_9,"I didn't have any plans, so I said yes, but"
d_ex_toyshop_03_10,they're still not back...
d_ex_toyshop_03_11,I've been handing out strawberry candy to the customers.
d_ex_toyshop_03_12,"Commander, if it's okay with you, would you like to keep me company?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_13,Understood.
d_ex_toyshop_03_14,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_03_15,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_03_16,Diesel? Commander?
d_ex_toyshop_03_17,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_toyshop_03_18,Just some part-time work.
d_ex_toyshop_03_19,"So we're part-timers, then?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_20,I guess you're right.
d_ex_toyshop_03_21,Looking for anything today?
d_ex_toyshop_03_22,"Yeah, I'm looking for a cat toy."
d_ex_toyshop_03_23,"A few days ago, my cat"
d_ex_toyshop_03_24,"started playing with a string, and he loved it."
d_ex_toyshop_03_25,So I thought it might be good to get him a proper cat toy...
d_ex_toyshop_03_26,I think we've got just the ticket.
d_ex_toyshop_03_27,"Which do you think would be best, Commander?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_28,A cat wand.
d_ex_toyshop_03_29,A shoelace.
d_ex_toyshop_03_30,Sounds good.
d_ex_toyshop_03_31,But where do you think they stock those?
d_ex_toyshop_03_32,"I'm sure that'd work,"
d_ex_toyshop_03_33,but do you think they'd sell shoe laces at a toy shop?
d_ex_toyshop_03_34,"If you can't find them, I can come back later."
d_ex_toyshop_03_35,Is that okay?
d_ex_toyshop_03_36,"Sorry, this is actually my first time being inside a toy shop."
d_ex_toyshop_03_37,It's okay. It's nothing urgent.
d_ex_toyshop_03_38,In that case...
d_ex_toyshop_03_39,???
d_ex_toyshop_03_40,have some strawberry candy!
d_ex_toyshop_03_41,Wow! Looks delicious.
d_ex_toyshop_03_42,You came all the way here so I don't want you to leave empty-handed.
d_ex_toyshop_03_43,Candy makes everything better!
d_ex_toyshop_03_44,"Thanks, I'll come back later."
d_ex_toyshop_03_45,"Take care, you two."
d_ex_toyshop_03_46,Go ahead.
d_ex_toyshop_03_47,Phew... running a store sure is tough.
d_ex_toyshop_03_48,I think the train station suits me much better.
d_ex_toyshop_03_49,Where the heck are Belorta and Mica anyway?
d_ex_toyshop_03_50,Probably out goofing around.
d_ex_toyshop_03_51,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_03_52,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_03_53,Didn't expect to see you two here!
d_ex_toyshop_03_54,"Hey Maxwell, are you looking for anything in particular?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_55,I'd like to buy a doll to be a test subject.
d_ex_toyshop_03_56,"But it seems the owners aren't here, so I guess I'll have to come back later?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_57,Something tells me you two aren't exactly doll experts.
d_ex_toyshop_03_58,Have some faith in us.
d_ex_toyshop_03_59,I'll find any doll that you want.
d_ex_toyshop_03_60,"Err... Commander, are you sure about that?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_61,Hmm... Is that so?
d_ex_toyshop_03_62,"I'm looking for a doll with ball joints, full articulation. About waist height."
d_ex_toyshop_03_63,"I need to be able to disassemble it, and..."
d_ex_toyshop_03_64,I'm sorry.
d_ex_toyshop_03_65,"Hehe, I knew it! I'll come back later."
d_ex_toyshop_03_66,"Before you go, have some strawberry candy."
d_ex_toyshop_03_67,"Oh, I was craving something sweet! Thanks!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_68,See you around.
d_ex_toyshop_03_69,"The owners need to get back, pronto."
d_ex_toyshop_03_70,You can say that again.
d_ex_toyshop_03_71,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_03_72,"Whoa, hey you two!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_73,"Hey, Alice."
d_ex_toyshop_03_74,"Sure, why not."
d_ex_toyshop_03_75,Are you looking to buy a toy?
d_ex_toyshop_03_76,"Actually, I heard I could get some strawberry candy by coming here."
d_ex_toyshop_03_77,"You haven't run out yet, have you?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_78,Are you talking about this?
d_ex_toyshop_03_79,Word travels fast.
d_ex_toyshop_03_80,That's the stuff! Hehe.
d_ex_toyshop_03_81,"If it's okay with you, could I have some too?"
d_ex_toyshop_03_82,"Of course you can have some. After all, candy always puts you in a good mood."
d_ex_toyshop_03_83,Thanks!
d_ex_toyshop_03_84,Ah...
d_ex_toyshop_03_85,What's wrong?
d_ex_toyshop_03_86,Could I maybe have one more? For the Queen?
d_ex_toyshop_03_87,She might be upset if I kept it all for myself.
d_ex_toyshop_03_88,"Sure, no problem."
d_ex_toyshop_03_89,There's plenty to go around.
d_ex_toyshop_03_90,"Hehe, thanks!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_91,I've got to hurry back so we can eat it together!
d_ex_toyshop_03_92,I hope you both enjoy it.
d_ex_toyshop_03_93,See you guys later!
d_ex_toyshop_03_94,Bye bye.
d_ex_toyshop_03_95,This place is becoming a candy shop.
d_ex_toyshop_03_96,"Hey, whatever brings in business!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_97,I'm just glad I brought enough candy.
d_ex_toyshop_03_98,Word quickly spread about how the toy shop was giving away free candy.
d_ex_toyshop_03_99,"Before long, the shop was packed with customers coming and going."
d_ex_toyshop_03_100,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_03_101,We're back!
d_ex_toyshop_03_102,"Oh, hi Old-Timer."
d_ex_toyshop_03_103,Sorry we're late.
d_ex_toyshop_03_104,Welcome back.
d_ex_toyshop_03_105,Where were you?
d_ex_toyshop_03_106,"We wanted to check out this new type of firecracker and lost track of time, sorry!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_107,Oh no... not a single sale while we were gone.
d_ex_toyshop_03_108,I was at least hoping for a few sales...
d_ex_toyshop_03_109,"But then again,"
d_ex_toyshop_03_110,we hardly ever have any customers.
d_ex_toyshop_03_111,I shouldn't exactly be surprised.
d_ex_toyshop_03_112,"Sure, but it'd be nice to at least have some..."
d_ex_toyshop_03_113,"You're right, even just one would be nice!"
d_ex_toyshop_03_114,Diesel and I decided to be silent about what happened today.
d_ex_toyshop_04_title,Alice's gift
d_ex_toyshop_04_1,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_04_2,Welcome.
d_ex_toyshop_04_3,Servant?
d_ex_toyshop_04_4,What are you manning the store for?
d_ex_toyshop_04_5,"*Yawn* Hey, Burly Bear."
d_ex_toyshop_04_6,I took over the toy store.
d_ex_toyshop_04_7,I kicked Mica and Belorta out.
d_ex_toyshop_04_8,Took over?
d_ex_toyshop_04_9,You must have deep pockets in order to do that.
d_ex_toyshop_04_10,"You're not secretly rich, are you?"
d_ex_toyshop_04_11,You did?
d_ex_toyshop_04_12,"Then you should be at the police station, not here."
d_ex_toyshop_04_13,"Neve, call the police."
d_ex_toyshop_04_14,"I was only kidding! I came to hang out, but no one is there, so I'm waiting for them."
d_ex_toyshop_04_15,What brings you here?
d_ex_toyshop_04_16,I came to buy a gift for Alice.
d_ex_toyshop_04_17,Anything specific?
d_ex_toyshop_04_18,There's a stuffed doll she always hugs tightly whenever she goes to sleep.
d_ex_toyshop_04_19,It's totally adorbs.
d_ex_toyshop_04_20,"But it's a bit worse for wear, so Ludmilla and I wanted to get her a new one."
d_ex_toyshop_04_21,She'd love that.
d_ex_toyshop_04_22,That's what we're hoping.
d_ex_toyshop_04_23,"Oooh! Look at this one, Ludmilla."
d_ex_toyshop_04_24,This one looks super cuddly.
d_ex_toyshop_04_25,Should we get it?
d_ex_toyshop_04_26,That thing is bigger than Alice.
d_ex_toyshop_04_27,Where will we put it?
d_ex_toyshop_04_28,"Fine... can I at least cuddle up with it? Just once, pleaaaase?"
d_ex_toyshop_04_29,"Even if we can't buy it, I can at least test out how cuddly it is."
d_ex_toyshop_04_30,Just to... to try and...
d_ex_toyshop_04_31,Zzzz...
d_ex_toyshop_04_32,...
d_ex_toyshop_04_33,Should we wake her?
d_ex_toyshop_04_34,No. Just leave her.
d_ex_toyshop_04_35,"She'll be angry if we do, and you won't like her when she's angry."
d_ex_toyshop_04_36,Would you mind helping me，
d_ex_toyshop_04_37,look for a suitable gift?
d_ex_toyshop_04_38,Sure.
d_ex_toyshop_04_39,Ludmilla and I slowly look around the toy store.
d_ex_toyshop_04_40,This place has all sorts of cute knick-knacks.
d_ex_toyshop_04_41,A music box?
d_ex_toyshop_04_42,This would look nice back at the home office.
d_ex_toyshop_04_43,Let's see how it sounds.
d_ex_toyshop_04_44,"*Twist, twist.*"
d_ex_toyshop_04_45,"*Ding, di-ring.*"
d_ex_toyshop_04_46,"*Tick, tick, tick, tick.*"
d_ex_toyshop_04_47,"After playing for a short while, the music box abruptly stops."
d_ex_toyshop_04_48,"Hey, what's wrong with this thing?"
d_ex_toyshop_04_49,... Perhaps you should just leave it.
d_ex_toyshop_04_50,Must be defective.
d_ex_toyshop_04_51,...
d_ex_toyshop_04_52,"Oh, is this a moving robot?"
d_ex_toyshop_04_53,This place has everything.
d_ex_toyshop_04_54,"*Zing, zing, zing.*"
d_ex_toyshop_04_55,*Pusssshhh*
d_ex_toyshop_04_56,What the... this is broken too?
d_ex_toyshop_04_57,There sure are a lot of defective products in here.
d_ex_toyshop_04_58,"Seems more like a junkyard that a toy store, if you ask me."
d_ex_toyshop_04_59,So... Alice's gift...
d_ex_toyshop_04_60,"Oh, right. I nearly forgot."
d_ex_toyshop_04_61,"Well, considering Belorta and Mica are MIA,"
d_ex_toyshop_04_62,is there any chance you could give me some recommendations?
d_ex_toyshop_04_63,I'm completely in the dark when it comes to this kind of thing.
d_ex_toyshop_04_64,How about a polar bear doll?
d_ex_toyshop_04_65,How about a rabbit doll?
d_ex_toyshop_04_66,I think Neve would get a kick out of that more than Alice.
d_ex_toyshop_04_67,Then how about a rabbit doll?
d_ex_toyshop_04_68,"A rabbit doll?
Hmm... that's a good suggestion."
d_ex_toyshop_04_69,Alice does have a soft spot for our furry little friends.
d_ex_toyshop_04_70,"All right, let's go with that. As for what color, I think pink suits her best."
d_ex_toyshop_04_71,Any chance you could gift-wrap it for me?
d_ex_toyshop_04_72,I'll do what I can.
d_ex_toyshop_04_73,Soon after.
d_ex_toyshop_04_74,"Thanks, Servant."
d_ex_toyshop_04_75,You've earned yourself a new customer.
d_ex_toyshop_04_76,"Neve, time to wake up."
d_ex_toyshop_04_77,Let's go give Alice her present.
d_ex_toyshop_04_78,Zzzzgrerenn... eh? How long am I out?
d_ex_toyshop_04_79,Did you pick a gift?
d_ex_toyshop_04_80,A pink rabbit doll.
d_ex_toyshop_04_81,"Oh nice, that sounds perfect for Alice."
d_ex_toyshop_04_82,"Anyway, see you next time, Burly Bear."
d_ex_toyshop_04_83,See you.
d_ex_toyshop_04_84,A few hours later.
d_ex_toyshop_04_85,Still no sign of Belorta or Mica.
d_ex_toyshop_04_86,Time to shove off.
d_ex_toyshop_04_87,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_04_88,Alice?
d_ex_toyshop_04_89,"Hmm? Hey, Rabbity!"
d_ex_toyshop_04_90,Are you looking for something?
d_ex_toyshop_04_91,I came to buy a rabbit doll.
d_ex_toyshop_04_92,... A rabbit doll?
d_ex_toyshop_04_93,"Yeah, I think it's about time I got a new one."
d_ex_toyshop_04_94,I had my sights set on a pink one.
d_ex_toyshop_04_95,How about buying a different doll?
d_ex_toyshop_04_96,Are you sure you don't want a different color?
d_ex_toyshop_04_97,But I wanted a rabbit doll...
d_ex_toyshop_04_98,But I wanted a pink one...
d_ex_toyshop_04_99,Do you think that's a bad idea?
d_ex_toyshop_04_100,Not at all... I think it suits you perfectly.
d_ex_toyshop_04_101,That's what I thought!
d_ex_toyshop_04_102,"A pink rabbit doll it is, then!"
d_ex_toyshop_04_103,A few minutes later.
d_ex_toyshop_04_104,Here you are.
d_ex_toyshop_04_105,"Yippee! Thanks, Rabbity!"
d_ex_toyshop_04_106,I can't wait to show this off to Queen and Nanook.
d_ex_toyshop_04_107,See you next time.
d_ex_toyshop_04_108,See you.
d_ex_toyshop_04_109,I should keep this a secret from Ludmilla and Neve.
d_ex_trainstation_01_title,Purpose of the Outpost Station?
d_ex_trainstation_01_1,"So, who are we taking here?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_2,Taking what?
d_ex_trainstation_01_3,"Who, not what!"
d_ex_trainstation_01_4,Who's going to ride on AZX? Who is our passenger?
d_ex_trainstation_01_5,"Oh, you don't know?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_6,There aren't any trains that run in the Outpost.
d_ex_trainstation_01_7,!!
d_ex_trainstation_01_8,Excuse me?
d_ex_trainstation_01_9,Not a single one?
d_ex_trainstation_01_10,Correct. The Outpost is not connected with the Ark or the surface.
d_ex_trainstation_01_11,"All we have is this station,"
d_ex_trainstation_01_12,and the train is inoperable as well.
d_ex_trainstation_01_13,"Wait, if you don't take any passengers, how come there's a station?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_14,What's the point of even having it?!
d_ex_trainstation_01_15,What's the point?
d_ex_trainstation_01_16,AZX is parked right outside the Outpost.
d_ex_trainstation_01_17,Isn't that meaningful enough?
d_ex_trainstation_01_18,"I-I guess so, but...!"
d_ex_trainstation_01_19,Why not just put the AZX in an exhibit then?
d_ex_trainstation_01_20,Soline.
d_ex_trainstation_01_21,You have to think about the big picture.
d_ex_trainstation_01_22,"Someday, the Outpost will be quite famous."
d_ex_trainstation_01_23,"Eventually, it will be connected to the Ark via railway."
d_ex_trainstation_01_24,"And further in the future, when we reclaim the surface,"
d_ex_trainstation_01_25,the railway will connect to the surface.
d_ex_trainstation_01_26,That will be this train station's time to shine.
d_ex_trainstation_01_27,... Will that day ever come?
d_ex_trainstation_01_28,Absolutely!
d_ex_trainstation_01_29,The future is unwritten.
d_ex_trainstation_01_30,"With that in mind,"
d_ex_trainstation_01_31,let's start preparing for that day by cleaning up the train station!
d_ex_trainstation_01_32,!!
d_ex_trainstation_01_33,!!
d_ex_trainstation_01_34,Erm... right now?
d_ex_trainstation_01_35,"Yep! Unlike the Ark, we don't have any cleaning robots here."
d_ex_trainstation_01_36,We'll have to clean it by ourselves.
d_ex_trainstation_01_37,The entire place?
d_ex_trainstation_01_38,All by ourselves?
d_ex_trainstation_01_39,I'm afraid so!
d_ex_trainstation_01_40,...
d_ex_trainstation_01_41,"D-Diesel... I think I might have a stomachache.
I'm gonna go rest for a bit."
d_ex_trainstation_01_42,You just need a pick-me-up! Have some strawberry candy.
d_ex_trainstation_01_43,"No, that won't help!"
d_ex_trainstation_01_44,"Well, considering how energetic that response was, you must be feeling better already."
d_ex_trainstation_01_45,...
d_ex_trainstation_01_46,Let's get to it then!
d_ex_trainstation_01_47,...
d_ex_trainstation_01_48,I step back to make my getaway.
d_ex_trainstation_01_49,"Where are you going, Commander?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_50,"You're going to help us, right?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_51,Everyone's counting on us.
d_ex_trainstation_01_52,"You're helping, aren't you?"
d_ex_trainstation_01_53,...
d_ex_trainstation_01_54,... All right.
d_ex_trainstation_01_55,I clean up the train station with Infinity Rail.
d_ex_trainstation_02_title,Tearful Train Station
d_ex_trainstation_02_1,Is all of this really necessary?
d_ex_trainstation_02_2,It's like a big event!
d_ex_trainstation_02_3,Well we're not event planners!
d_ex_trainstation_02_4,Event?
d_ex_trainstation_02_5,"Oh, hi Commander."
d_ex_trainstation_02_6,Infinity Rail decided to venture out a bit.
d_ex_trainstation_02_7,We're calling it the Light Rail Food Truck.
d_ex_trainstation_02_8,You're operating a food truck?
d_ex_trainstation_02_9,That's right! This is just a test run.
d_ex_trainstation_02_10,"If it goes well, we plan to sell food inside the train station."
d_ex_trainstation_02_11,"So, I was wondering..."
d_ex_trainstation_02_12,Are you any good at cooking?
d_ex_trainstation_02_13,I know my way around the kitchen.
d_ex_trainstation_02_14,Perfect!
d_ex_trainstation_02_15,So what do you know how to make?
d_ex_trainstation_02_16,Sweet and sour chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_02_17,Toast.
d_ex_trainstation_02_18,"Mmm, sweet and sour... makes your mouth water!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_19,"Coincidentally, it just so happens that that's what we're serving today."
d_ex_trainstation_02_20,"Making sweet and sour chicken isn't easy, but I like a good challenge."
d_ex_trainstation_02_21,"Toast, huh?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_22,"I'm a big fan of toast with lots of strawberry jam,"
d_ex_trainstation_02_23,but unfortunately today's main dish is sweet and sour chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_02_24,"I've already prepared all the ingredients, so don't worry."
d_ex_trainstation_02_25,And Soline will be your assistant if need be.
d_ex_trainstation_02_26,"Hey, why me?!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_27,"I'd love to help, but I'm really backed up at work, so I've got to go."
d_ex_trainstation_02_28,"Oh, by the way, Brid said she'll drop by if she's free after work."
d_ex_trainstation_02_29,Best of luck to both of you!
d_ex_trainstation_02_30,Diesel slinks off.
d_ex_trainstation_02_31,What's the point of this?!
d_ex_trainstation_02_32,Why are we doing this at a train station that isn't even operating?!
d_ex_trainstation_02_33,"All I've been doing is cleaning all day, now I'm expected to cook as well?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_34,"Despite Soline's grumbling, she is already prepping the ingredients."
d_ex_trainstation_02_35,"Commander, are we going to use this onion?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_36,Slicing onions always make me cry. You do it.
d_ex_trainstation_02_37,A little while later.
d_ex_trainstation_02_38,"Hmm, not too bad... what do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_39,"I've tasted it so much, I can't really tell anymore."
d_ex_trainstation_02_40,Let's add some chili powder.
d_ex_trainstation_02_41,A pinch more sugar.
d_ex_trainstation_02_42,Are you sure that won't make it too spicy?
d_ex_trainstation_02_43,Don't you think that'll make it too sweet?
d_ex_trainstation_02_44,*Sniff sniff* so this is where that smell is coming from!
d_ex_trainstation_02_45,Smells delicious.
d_ex_trainstation_02_46,"Novel insisted we follow the scent,"
d_ex_trainstation_02_47,so here we are.
d_ex_trainstation_02_48,"Hey, Noob! What are you doing here?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_49,I'm helping sell sweet and sour chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_02_50,"Oh, it looks amazing!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_51,"Just as I thought, always trust your nose."
d_ex_trainstation_02_52,Hm...
d_ex_trainstation_02_53,count me out.
d_ex_trainstation_02_54,"Just one bite! Once you try it, I'm sure you'll love it."
d_ex_trainstation_02_55,I'm not sure about that...
d_ex_trainstation_02_56,Try a piece.
d_ex_trainstation_02_57,"You sure? Well in that case, don't mind if I do."
d_ex_trainstation_02_58,The smell is making my mouth water.
d_ex_trainstation_02_59,"I'm still not entirely convinced,"
d_ex_trainstation_02_60,"but if you insist, Noob, I'll try some."
d_ex_trainstation_02_61,Soline and I look at Novel and Exia nervously.
d_ex_trainstation_02_62,Well? What do you think?
d_ex_trainstation_02_63,Well... if I die of poisoning...
d_ex_trainstation_02_64,I think we can trace it back to this chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_02_65,...
d_ex_trainstation_02_66,"Oh come on, it's not that bad!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_67,I knew it!
d_ex_trainstation_02_68,It was fine when I tasted it earlier...
d_ex_trainstation_02_69,Then I'd say your taste buds are shot.
d_ex_trainstation_02_70,It is rather baffling how this chicken came to taste like this.
d_ex_trainstation_02_71,I feel like I need to call in forensics...
d_ex_trainstation_02_72,Is it really that bad?
d_ex_trainstation_02_73,"Not bad, just... peculiar."
d_ex_trainstation_02_74,"No, it's bad. Plain and simple."
d_ex_trainstation_02_75,"I'm sorry to say this, but it's... just terrible."
d_ex_trainstation_02_76,Cooking this terrible should be a crime.
d_ex_trainstation_02_77,Surely you're exaggerating...
d_ex_trainstation_02_78,"Hey, if you've got nothing nice to say, then beat it!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_79,"As a detective, I am duty-bound to tell the truth."
d_ex_trainstation_02_80,I suggest you give it another try.
d_ex_trainstation_02_81,Even though I doubt it'll turn out any different.
d_ex_trainstation_02_82,"Novel and Exia disappear, leaving behind all the sweet and sour chicken."
d_ex_trainstation_02_83,"I refuse to believe it's that bad! What do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_84,It's disgusting.
d_ex_trainstation_02_85,It's delicious.
d_ex_trainstation_02_86,So you're saying there really is something wrong with my taste buds?
d_ex_trainstation_02_87,I thought it was really good...
d_ex_trainstation_02_88,Right? I thought it was okay...
d_ex_trainstation_02_89,Novel and Exia are the ones with bum taste buds.
d_ex_trainstation_02_90,"Besides, everyone has different taste."
d_ex_trainstation_02_91,How's everything going?
d_ex_trainstation_02_92,Brid!!
d_ex_trainstation_02_93,"I had some time on my hands, so I decided to stop by."
d_ex_trainstation_02_94,Diesel told me you two were making sweet and sour chicken?
d_ex_trainstation_02_95,"Ah, so this is it then?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_96,Would you like to try some?
d_ex_trainstation_02_97,"Sure, why not?"
d_ex_trainstation_02_98,Brid takes a bite of the chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_02_99,"Soline and I watch Brid, our eyes filled with anticipation."
d_ex_trainstation_02_100,Hmm...
d_ex_trainstation_02_101,How is it?
d_ex_trainstation_02_102,What do you think?
d_ex_trainstation_02_103,I'll... refrain from commenting.
d_ex_trainstation_02_104,What?! Don't tell me you hate it too?
d_ex_trainstation_02_105,Do you think it tastes bad?
d_ex_trainstation_02_106,It might not be a top seller.
d_ex_trainstation_02_107,Suffice to say I don't think the food truck will be a success.
d_ex_trainstation_02_108,But Soline and I worked hard on it!
d_ex_trainstation_02_109,"Yeah, we worked out butts off!"
d_ex_trainstation_02_110,"And we all appreciate that,"
d_ex_trainstation_02_111,"but for the moment at least,"
d_ex_trainstation_02_112,I think it needs a little bit more improvement.
d_ex_trainstation_02_113,I'll talk to Diesel.
d_ex_trainstation_02_114,So we can't sell these?
d_ex_trainstation_02_115,"Sorry, I really should be getting back to work..."
d_ex_trainstation_02_116,I'll see you around.
d_ex_trainstation_02_117,"Brid rushes off in a flash, the chicken still in her mouth."
d_ex_trainstation_02_118,"Commander, I really think we're..."
d_ex_trainstation_02_119,... completely screwed.
d_ex_trainstation_02_120,Soline and I each take a bite of the remaining sweet and sour chicken.
d_ex_trainstation_03_title,Train Station Crisis
d_ex_trainstation_03_1,So this is the fabled AZX.
d_ex_trainstation_03_2,It's my first time seeing it with my own eyes.
d_ex_trainstation_03_3,"Have you ever traveled on this train before, Cutey?"
d_ex_trainstation_03_4,No.
d_ex_trainstation_03_5,It looks like the door is open. How about we go in and poke around?
d_ex_trainstation_03_6,Come on!
d_ex_trainstation_03_7,Are you sure we're allowed to?
d_ex_trainstation_03_8,What's the big deal? We're just taking a quick look around.
d_ex_trainstation_03_9,Who knows what neat things we could find inside?
d_ex_trainstation_03_10,"We've just gotten on the train, when..."
d_ex_trainstation_03_11,*Buzz*
d_ex_trainstation_03_12,the door of the train slams shut.
d_ex_trainstation_03_13,"Hey, how come the door closed? Wait, could you want to..."
d_ex_trainstation_03_14,"You little devil! You're so bad, tee-hee!"
d_ex_trainstation_03_15,I didn't shut the door.
d_ex_trainstation_03_16,"Oh, really? Guess the door shut by itself then."
d_ex_trainstation_03_17,But... How do I open it? I don't see any levers or anything.
d_ex_trainstation_03_18,"Ah, here's a button to open it."
d_ex_trainstation_03_19,*Beep*
d_ex_trainstation_03_20,*Beep beep*
d_ex_trainstation_03_21,Guess it's broken.
d_ex_trainstation_03_22,Are we locked inside?
d_ex_trainstation_03_23,Seems so.
d_ex_trainstation_03_24,"The driver's compartment is locked, too."
d_ex_trainstation_03_25,There must be some other way of opening it...
d_ex_trainstation_03_26,"Actually, this is kind of exciting! It's like a puzzle we've got to solve."
d_ex_trainstation_03_27,*Knock knock*
d_ex_trainstation_03_28,What... yo... ing?
d_ex_trainstation_03_29,Privaty?
d_ex_trainstation_03_30,Wh... doi...?
d_ex_trainstation_03_31,Can you understand what she is saying?
d_ex_trainstation_03_32,Not a word.
d_ex_trainstation_03_33,In that case...
d_ex_trainstation_03_34,The handle! Use the handle! Open the door!
d_ex_trainstation_03_35,"Maxwell gesticulates wildly at Privaty, who is on the other side of the door window."
d_ex_trainstation_03_36,The door! How do we open it?
d_ex_trainstation_03_37,Ah! Go... it... open!
d_ex_trainstation_03_38,*Buzz*
d_ex_trainstation_03_39,It's open!
d_ex_trainstation_03_40,What are you two doing in here?
d_ex_trainstation_03_41,"As she talks, Privaty gets on the train."
d_ex_trainstation_03_42,*Buzz*
d_ex_trainstation_03_43,The door once again closes on its own.
d_ex_trainstation_03_44,Huh?
d_ex_trainstation_03_45,Why did you come inside?!
d_ex_trainstation_03_46,Huh? Should I not have?
d_ex_trainstation_03_47,We can just open the door and get out anyway.
d_ex_trainstation_03_48,*Beep*
d_ex_trainstation_03_49,*Beep* *Beep*
d_ex_trainstation_03_50,Huh? What the... how come it isn't opening?
d_ex_trainstation_03_51,"It's broken, and we can't get into the driver's compartment either."
d_ex_trainstation_03_52,"All right, get out of the way. I'm gonna blast the door off its hinges."
d_ex_trainstation_03_53,I'd advise against that. Not unless you want to end up in court on vandalism charges.
d_ex_trainstation_03_54,They've already got enough on their plate as is.
d_ex_trainstation_03_55,"Well, we can't just sit around and wait for someone to come to save us."
d_ex_trainstation_03_56,"Then again, if you two are willing to become my test subjects, I'd be willing to spend a little more time here..."
d_ex_trainstation_03_57,Test subjects?!
d_ex_trainstation_03_58,I'd rather not.
d_ex_trainstation_03_59,"Fine then, you got any better ideas?"
d_ex_trainstation_03_60,Let's try and use our phones to call someone.
d_ex_trainstation_03_61,Let's use the fire extinguisher to break the window.
d_ex_trainstation_03_62,I left mine in the laboratory.
d_ex_trainstation_03_63,"I was just popping out for a short errand, so I didn't bring mine."
d_ex_trainstation_03_64,We'll use mine... No battery.
d_ex_trainstation_03_65,"All right then, our only recourse is to smash the window."
d_ex_trainstation_03_66,Weren't you against that just a minute ago?
d_ex_trainstation_03_67,That's because you wanted to use your gun! How about we use something safer like... the fire extinguisher.
d_ex_trainstation_03_68,I guess we don't have much choice.
d_ex_trainstation_03_69,Huh? You were against it when I proposed the idea.
d_ex_trainstation_03_70,That's because you wanted to use your gun!
d_ex_trainstation_03_71,Privaty picks up the fire extinguisher nearby.
d_ex_trainstation_03_72,"I'll count to three, then I'll smash the window."
d_ex_trainstation_03_73,1.
d_ex_trainstation_03_74,2.
d_ex_trainstation_03_75,3!
d_ex_trainstation_03_76,*Poof screech*
d_ex_trainstation_03_77,What the...?!
d_ex_trainstation_03_78,"The fire extinguisher bursts, causing white powder to spew everywhere."
d_ex_trainstation_03_79,*Cough cough* What are you doing?
d_ex_trainstation_03_80,I think I pulled the safety pin by accident.
d_ex_trainstation_03_81,"*Cough* I can barely see! That's it, I'm going to use my gun..."
d_ex_trainstation_03_82,*Buzz*
d_ex_trainstation_03_83,"Suddenly, the door of the train opens."
d_ex_trainstation_03_84,The three of us rush out.
d_ex_trainstation_03_85,"*Cough* Man, things got a little hairy back there."
d_ex_trainstation_03_86,*Cough* We all nearly became cautionary tales.
d_ex_trainstation_03_87,Oh for Pete's sake! I just cleaned this place up! What happened?
d_ex_trainstation_03_88,Soline?
d_ex_trainstation_03_89,How did you even manage to get on the train without authorization?
d_ex_trainstation_03_90,Just calm down and hear us out...
d_ex_trainstation_03_91,"*Sob* I just spent ages cleaning this place, and you're asking me to calm down?!"
d_ex_trainstation_03_92,I'm going to get Diesel and Brid. You all stay right here!
d_ex_trainstation_03_93,Soline storms off.
d_ex_trainstation_03_94,I told you we should have just blown the door off and made our escape.
d_ex_trainstation_03_95,We are so screwed...
d_ex_trainstation_03_96,"We all sit down, awaiting our punishment."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_title,Statue Ghost Stories
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_1,"Not long ago, scary rumors were going around at the Outpost."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_2,Th-that day... I came back from the Ark with Commander.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_3,"While I was saying good-bye to Commander,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_4,I suddenly felt that someone was maliciously staring at me from behind.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_5,"Then, I turned around and saw something fly by quickly."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_6,I was soooo scared! I really clung to Sweetie beside me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_7,"Since then, bad things started to happen one after another."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_8,I had express boxes containing newly brought shoes and cosmetics vanish for no reason.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_9,"When live streaming, people would usually comment that something was standing behind us or would flash by."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_10,Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_11,... So we can conclude that what the victims have in common is
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_12,that they all passed by the Wings of Victory statue after seeing you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_13,"So, clearly we have our suspect."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_14,"It's you, Watson!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_15,"Oh, it has come to this."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_16,Don't accuse someone out of the blue.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_17,Shall we go to the police station?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_18,No need because I'm not the suspect.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_19,Tsk. I thought I already had this case in the bag.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_20,"We should go to the crime scene
and investigate further."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_21,... Soon.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_22,Huh...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_23,It looks exactly like the Goddess of Victory's wings...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_24,It reminds me of marble statues from the Renaissance... It's both modern and classic...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_25,The connection between this beautiful statue and the case is...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_26,I still have no clue. Te-hee!
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_27,"So much for your famous ""detective"" title."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_28,I will investigate it myself.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_29,"Er, ab-about that..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_30,I will give it all I've got starting today. You just sit tight and watch.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_31,Ah... all right.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_32,"You know, I'm actually a generous detective. I always want my assistants to shine so I give them a chance."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_33,"We've been observing the Wings of Victory for a while now,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_34,"but still, we don't know who the suspect is."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_35,"And then, evening comes."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_36,... I just realized something.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_37,"The most crucial piece of this case is not the Wings of Victory statue,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_38,but the victims.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_39,What do you mean?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_40,Think about it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_41,The victims were all close to you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_42,That closeness might have angered the suspect.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_43,You being intimate with them was the reason they were targeted.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_44,The suspect tailed the Nikkes after their dates and pranked them.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_45,...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_46,What is it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_47,... Did you feel that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_48,I felt a chill crawling down my spine...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_49,Look behind Novel.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_50,Look at the top of the Wings of Victory statue.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_51,*Whoosh*
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_52,Something flashes by behind Novel so fast that the human body can't keep up.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_53,*Whoosh*
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_54,Something flashes by on top of the Wings of Victory statue with a speed that's impossible for the naked eye to see.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_55,A yellow afterimage made out of energy is left at the place where that thing flew by.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_56,... Energy particles?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_57,Huh?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_58,It seems the suspect has a pair of wings made of energy particles.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_59,*Beep beep*
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_60,Advanced technology making use of energy particles.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_61,Its top speed makes it impossible for the naked eye to catch up. And the most important piece... the wings.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_62,There is only one person who matches all those descriptions.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_63,Do you mean... Isabel?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_64,"... Ah, you got me."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_65,"I'm sorry, Darling."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_66,It was not my intention to disturb you. I just wanted to protect you quietly.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_67,"But during that time, you were dating ten girls in a week."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_68,I got... *sigh* I got grief filling my heart.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_69,I'm sorry.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_70,That was all just for work.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_71,"... No, Darling."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_72,... Is that really true?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_73,I can't believe these words.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_74,But how can I really blame you for all of this?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_75,"What should be blamed is your charm, Darling."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_76,So you don't have to do anything.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_77,I will take care of it myself.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_78,I will get rid of anyone who dares to flirt with you...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_79,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_80,"So, is the case solved?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_81,I guess so.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_82,But maybe...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_83,"Well first, we need to put up a notice on the statue."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_84,"You know, to prevent these things from happening again."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_85,"... Later, in front of the Wings of Victory statue."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_86,Eh? What?
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_87,"Look here, Commander."
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_88,There's a weird notice on the statue...
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_89,Read it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_90,“Do not flirt with or seduce the Commander
d_ex_wingofvictory_01_91,within 300 meters of this statue.”
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_title,"Feather of the Abyss, Awaken"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_1,"One ordinary afternoon,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_2,"I was passing by the Wings of Victory statue, when..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_3,Have you noticed?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_4,*Swoosh*
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_5,The wind...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_6,it's blowing differently today.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_7,Just keep walking.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_8,You feel it too?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_9,It's the blood wind!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_10,There is an urgency in Guillotine's voice.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_11,"Or rather, the wind carries the scent of blood."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_12,Yes.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_13,This wind carries a sickening smell of blood.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_14,There is no doubt. Those fiends have already followed me to the Outpost.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_15,Who are you talking about?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_16,"Do you mean ""them""?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_17,It's them.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_18,Don't ask any further. It could be dangerous.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_19,Yes. Them.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_20,They'll be laying siege to this place soon.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_21,Normally I could have subdued them with my eyes closed...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_22,... But there is one major issue.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_23,The one-winged dark lord dwelling within me
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_24,has been unable to open its eyes.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_25,Try giving him a few good whacks.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_26,That's not good.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_27,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_28,"Indeed, we are in serious trouble."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_29,There is only one way to awaken the demon king before they are upon us.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_30,"Right here, we should do it here in front of the statue."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_31,We must fulfill the trinity.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_32,"To do that, we require three spellcasters."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_33,"You and I make two,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_34,but the problem is getting one more.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_35,Do you know of anyone who can help us by any chance?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_36,Why don't you call one of your friends?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_37,"Other than you,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_38,Ingrid and Maiden are the only other friends I have.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_39,"In other words, the three of us are the only friends you have."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_40,*Pet her shoulder quietly*
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_41,"I am the Guardian of Balance, such solitude is inevitable."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_42,Do not pity me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_43,"What about you, then?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_44,Do you have any friends who can come here?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_45,Exia.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_46,Maiden.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_47,I'll try to contact Exia and request help.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_1,Exia.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_2,Yes?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_3,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_4,You're not contacting me
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_5,"to play the new expansion pack together,"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_6,are you?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_7,"If that's the case, I have plenty of time, hehe!"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_8,It's not that. It has to do with the consciousness of the Trinity.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_9,The what of the what?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_10,That sounds like some nonsense
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_11,Guillotine would make up.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_12,"Yeah, it's a ritual I'm doing with Guillotine."
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_13,"For a while, there is no reply from Exia."
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_14,Sorry...
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_15,A friend of a friend just told me
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_16,"their uncle passed away,"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_17,and I've got to attend the funeral.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_18,"So I can't make it,"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_01_19,sorry.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_48,I'll try to contact Maiden and request help.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_1,Maiden.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_2,"Hi Commander,"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_3,is something the matter?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_4,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_5,"No, what is it?"
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_6,Are we going out? Just the two of us?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_7,Give me some time to get ready.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_8,"Actually, it wouldn't be just the two of us."
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_9,What?
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_10,Guillotine is here as well.
m_ex_wingofvictory_02_02_11,Maiden left the group chat.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_49,... What happened?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_50,I couldn't get anyone to show up.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_51,This isn't good...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_52,If we don't hurry and find the last person to do the ritual
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_53,the Outpost will be overrun by the blood wind!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_54,"Excuse me, are you in some kind of trouble?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_55,Isabel?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_56,That's me!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_57,"I was watching you from the sky... er, I mean I was thinking about you,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_58,so I came here to see if you were in trouble.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_59,... I feel extraordinary energy coming off you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_60,But now is not the time for that.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_61,Anyone willing to help is welcome.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_62,Would you care to participate in our ritual?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_63,I...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_64,"Isabel, please."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_65,...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_66,"If it's you asking,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_67,how can I refuse?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_68,What do you need me to do?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_69,... A moment later.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_70,"After drawing a ceremonial magic circle in front of the statue,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_71,We each stood around the circle at three equidistant points.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_72,"My friends, the moment of truth has arrived."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_73,"Once I recite the Incantation of Two Wings,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_74,the wings of this statue and the sealed wings of the Demon King will merge into one.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_75,They will become a perfect pair and light up the sky.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_76,"Once that happens, ""they"" will no longer be able to wander around here."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_77,Understood.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_78,Do you actually understand what she's saying?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_79,"Of course, Darling!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_80,So long as it makes you happy.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_81,No chit-chatting!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_82,Let us begin the chant.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_83,Guillotine takes a deep breath.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_84,"Oh, black wings slumbering in the deep abyss!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_85,"Oh, the white wings which have splintered into lonely fragments!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_86,"I will bring you together as one, in this place, in this time."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_87,"May two pairs of wings become one, and waken their master!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_88,Wings of Disillusion!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_89,*Flash*
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_90,A spark of energy flashes before our eyes.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_91,"At the very same moment, Isabel flies at near supersonic speed."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_92,"Before long, as Guillotine foretold,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_93,a pair of brightly shining wings are spread wide open within the magic circle.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_94,W-wings...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_95,Actual wings!
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_96,*Thud*
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_97,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_98,"Isabel, you can come down now."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_99,"Hey, Darling."
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_100,Did I do something wrong?
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_101,"You both seemed so eager to see wings,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_102,so I was just trying to show you what you wanted...
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_103,Don't worry.
d_ex_wingofvictory_02_104,Guillotine got so excited that she passed out.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_title,"Double, Double Toil, and Trouble"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_1,... What are you up to?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_2,Me? I'm making a witch's brew.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_3,And what exactly do you plan to do to with it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_4,Well... that can be somewhat difficult to explain to those unfamiliar with the ways of witches.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_5,"However, explaining it to you could make for an amusing diversion."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_6,I am creating a potion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_7,A potion?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_8,"What are you, a parrot? Why do you keep repeating what I say?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_9,You're the one prattling on.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_10,"Ladies, let's not quarrel."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_11,It can only be called a quarrel if you're talking to someone worth arguing with.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_12,"... Should I report her, No. 7?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_13,Hold on.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_14,If you say so...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_15,"Dandelion petals, some pitcher plants and a smattering of seashells."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_16,Are you trying to make skincare cream?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_17,You know your stuff.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_18,You may have earned the right to wear that lab coat after all.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_19,It won't have a long shelf life if you do that.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_20,"But then again, that sort of thing may not matter to an amateur like yourself."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_21,"Hehe, I could care less about its shelf life."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_22,I just enjoy the process of making it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_23,But your ingredients seem a bit off...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_24,Are you sure these are the right proportions?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_25,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_26,"If something were to go wrong,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_27,you'd end up with an entire cauldron of dangerous chemicals! You could blow this entire place sky high!
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_28,You think I don't already know that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_29,You're really threading the needle here.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_30,"I know, isn't it fun?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_31,What?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_32,"You over there, come and put the last ingredient into the mixture."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_33,What is that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_34,What do you say we play a little game?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_35,See those two bottles over there?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_36,Take one of them and pour it into the cauldron.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_37,"One of them will produce a skincare cream, and the other one? Poison, I'm afraid."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_38,And you consider this sick game a hobby?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_39,The weak have always submitted to the strong for their amusement. That's the way of the world.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_40,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_41,"Come, choose a bottle."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_42,Choose the one on the left.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_43,Choose the one on the right.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_44,Are you sure?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_45,"All right, pour it into the cauldron."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_46,"Wow, what's that?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_47,What is that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_48,What is that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_49,"I picked up this wonderful aroma, and followed it all the way here. What are you doing?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_50,?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_51,You think it... smells nice?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_52,"Hi, Commander."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_53,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_54,Are you all cooking together?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_55,Let me help!
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_56,"Emma, it's not what you think..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_57,Wait.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_58,How do you intend on helping us?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_59,I think I can make it tastier.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_60,Tastier?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_61,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_62,"Fine, go ahead."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_63,"All right, I'll see what I can do!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_64,30 minutes later.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_65,All done!
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_66,"In front of us, the liquid simmers in the cauldron."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_67,... You call this food?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_68,"I mean, technically speaking, you could eat it."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_69,In what twisted world
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_70,would you consider this food?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_71,... Don't ask me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_72,"This is my first time testing out this recipe, but I think it turned out nice!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_73,What should we name it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_74,Agent Green.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_75,The Devil's Halitosis.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_76,Huh? I don't think I quite understand...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_77,Forget I said anything.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_78,"Well, names can wait."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_79,Who wants to be the first to taste it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_80,"I'm positive you'll enjoy it, honestly!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_81,Why don't you try it yourself then...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_82,... I'm not hungry.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_83,Er... I'm... on a diet! Yeah!
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_84,I have indigestion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_85,I've got heartburn.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_86,"Oh, really?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_87,I was afraid this would happen...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_88,... so I brought some stomach medicine with me!
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_89,"My, my, what got you into this?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_90,"I was afraid this would happen, so I prepared some antacids."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_91,Those should help with your heartburn.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_92,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_93,"Come on, open up and say ""aaahhhh""."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_94,"Ether, Harran."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_95,Yeah?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_96,What is it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_97,Give me a decent burial.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_98,We will.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_99,You got it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_100,"I open my mouth, and take the plunge."
d_ex_wingofvictory_03_101,*Gulp*
d_ex_workshop_01_title,Engineer VS Pilgrims: Let the Sparks Fly
d_ex_workshop_01_1,*Giggle giggle*
d_ex_workshop_01_2,Is this the workshop for the underground tunnel?
d_ex_workshop_01_3,We've got customers!
d_ex_workshop_01_4,It's not so bad on the inside.
d_ex_workshop_01_5,But doesn't the engineer seem a bit... shady?
d_ex_workshop_01_6,I doubt this can even hold a candle to Eden's technology.
d_ex_workshop_01_7,!!
d_ex_workshop_01_8,There's nothing mightier than Mighty Tools!
d_ex_workshop_01_9,Impossible isn't part of our vocabulary!
d_ex_workshop_01_10,"You don't say? All right, then."
d_ex_workshop_01_11,You see this shield?
d_ex_workshop_01_12,Make a drill that can pierce through it.
d_ex_workshop_01_13,Just a little reminder: Tyrant level Raptures can't put a dent in it.
d_ex_workshop_01_14,This is the strongest shield on earth.
d_ex_workshop_01_15,...
d_ex_workshop_01_16,"Let me guess, you can't do it? *Snicker*"
d_ex_workshop_01_17,So much for 'almighty'. I knew all these underground dwellers...
d_ex_workshop_01_18,Consider it done.
d_ex_workshop_01_19,I'll put my reputation on the line.
d_ex_workshop_01_20,I will make
d_ex_workshop_01_21,a drill that can pierce that shield of yours.
d_ex_workshop_01_22,... Huh?
d_ex_workshop_01_23,"Hey now, no need to take this so seriously..."
d_ex_workshop_01_24,No!
d_ex_workshop_01_25,Liter has worked her whole life building up Mighty Tools!
d_ex_workshop_01_26,I won't let it all fall because of me!
d_ex_workshop_01_27,Wh... what is going on?
d_ex_workshop_01_28,I was just kidding around...
d_ex_workshop_01_29,"Well, at any rate, it's not like she'll actually succeed."
d_ex_workshop_01_30,"All right, give me your best shot."
d_ex_workshop_01_31,"But if you can't make a scratch on my shield in 3 days,"
d_ex_workshop_01_32,everyone will know that Mighty Tools is nothing but a sham. Got it?
d_ex_workshop_01_33,"Good luck, then. *Giggle*"
d_ex_workshop_01_34,...
d_ex_workshop_01_35,Dear Liter.
d_ex_workshop_01_36,"In your absence, I have encountered a formidable foe unlike any I have come up against."
d_ex_workshop_01_37,How am I supposed to make a drill capable of piercing that Pilgrim's shield?
d_ex_workshop_01_38,Not even a weapon of pure Goddesium could make a dent.
d_ex_workshop_01_39,But you have always told me to never accept defeat.
d_ex_workshop_01_40,"Even if I lose, I will not take it lying down!"
d_ex_workshop_01_41,I will make it work!
d_ex_workshop_01_42,I will make a drill that pierces that shield!
d_ex_workshop_01_43,... A bit later.
d_ex_workshop_01_44,...
d_ex_workshop_01_45,You seem nervous.
d_ex_workshop_01_46,I'm not nervous! It's just
d_ex_workshop_01_47,that bet I made with that goofy-looking engineer...
d_ex_workshop_01_48,What I asked of her is clearly impossible.
d_ex_workshop_01_49,"But she's all full of piss and vinegar, as if she actually believes it's possible."
d_ex_workshop_01_50,What if...
d_ex_workshop_01_51,"if she actually ends up pulling this off, I'll be disgraced."
d_ex_workshop_01_52,A pilgrim's shield was pierced by a drill made from the underground!
d_ex_workshop_01_53,"That kind of useless shield, I wouldn't even want it for free!"
d_ex_workshop_01_54,"... Well, that's the gist of it."
d_ex_workshop_01_55,"If you're so anxious, why don't we go sneak a peek?"
d_ex_workshop_01_56,"Wait, what?"
d_ex_workshop_01_57,Surely that's not necessary?
d_ex_workshop_01_58,That makes it seem like I'm actually worried about all this... which I'm not!
d_ex_workshop_01_59,"... A bit later, at the Mighty Tools workshop."
d_ex_workshop_01_60,Can you see anything?
d_ex_workshop_01_61,Centi is tempering.
d_ex_workshop_01_62,I can't see through the window. It's too small.
d_ex_workshop_01_63,"Bah, get out of the way. Let me see."
d_ex_workshop_01_64,...
d_ex_workshop_01_65,That stupid...
d_ex_workshop_01_66,What's she slaving away for?
d_ex_workshop_01_67,It's not going to change anything.
d_ex_workshop_01_68,"It's the process that's important, not the result."
d_ex_workshop_01_69,Everyone has something they just can't compromise on.
d_ex_workshop_01_70,Pssh.
d_ex_workshop_01_71,"If you're lacking in ability, that spurt of passion won't get you anywhere..."
d_ex_workshop_01_72,"Working harder, not smarter."
d_ex_workshop_01_73,Makes me sick.
d_ex_workshop_01_74,"... The next day, at the Mighty Tools workshop."
d_ex_workshop_01_75,What is she doing today?
d_ex_workshop_01_76,She's carving the individual spirals of a drill.
d_ex_workshop_01_77,"Wow, she's really something."
d_ex_workshop_01_78,What if my shield gets scratched...
d_ex_workshop_01_79,"No, wait, forget I said that."
d_ex_workshop_01_80,I take it back! Don't want to jinx me.
d_ex_workshop_01_81,"On the last day, at the Mighty Tools workshop."
d_ex_workshop_01_82,...
d_ex_workshop_01_83,...
d_ex_workshop_01_84,...
d_ex_workshop_01_85,Finished!
d_ex_workshop_01_86,The drill is done!
d_ex_workshop_01_87,All that's left to do is try it out.
d_ex_workshop_01_88,...
d_ex_workshop_01_89,I can see that.
d_ex_workshop_01_90,Noah holds up the drill Centi made.
d_ex_workshop_01_91,*Gulp*
d_ex_workshop_01_92,Well... shall we?
d_ex_workshop_01_93,Let's!
d_ex_workshop_01_94,*Turns on drill*
d_ex_workshop_01_95,*Bzzzzzzzzz*
d_ex_workshop_01_96,The drill scratches at the surface of the shield for a while.
d_ex_workshop_01_97,Then...
d_ex_workshop_01_98,Is that...
d_ex_workshop_01_99,a crack?
d_ex_workshop_01_100,It is!
d_ex_workshop_01_101,No way.
d_ex_workshop_01_102,I don't see anything!
d_ex_workshop_01_103,What are you talking about?
d_ex_workshop_01_104,"Right here, look!"
d_ex_workshop_01_105,That thing's practically microscopic!
d_ex_workshop_01_106,I'll make another one.
d_ex_workshop_01_107,I'm sure it'll be big enough this time!
d_ex_workshop_01_108,N-no need! The bet's off.
d_ex_workshop_01_109,!!
d_ex_workshop_01_110,So... has Mighty Tools
d_ex_workshop_01_111,failed?
d_ex_workshop_01_112,No. Matter of fact...
d_ex_workshop_01_113,I'm worried you'll actually pull it off next time.
d_ex_workshop_01_114,!!
d_ex_workshop_01_115,What a nuisance you all are.
d_ex_workshop_01_116,Makes my hair stand on end seeing weaklings like you make such large strides.
d_ex_workshop_01_117,"... Well, I'll be going then."
d_ex_workshop_01_118,"By the way,"
d_ex_workshop_01_119,I'll have a normal request for you next time.
d_ex_workshop_01_120,So don't let me see your skills slipping.
d_ex_workshop_01_121,Boss...
d_ex_workshop_01_122,was that... a compliment from her?
d_ex_workshop_01_123,"I didn't bring shame to Liter's name, did I?"
d_ex_workshop_01_124,She'll be proud of you.
d_ex_workshop_01_125,Th-thank you!
d_ex_workshop_01_126,I'll keep improving!
d_ex_workshop_01_127,I'll be there cheering you on all the way.
d_ex_workshop_02_title,Need Anything? Come to the Workshop!
d_ex_workshop_02_1,"Liter, I'm done with packing!"
d_ex_workshop_02_2,Good work. It's about time we head out.
d_ex_workshop_02_3,Another business trip?
d_ex_workshop_02_4,"Yes, a hotel extension. We'll be there for a few days."
d_ex_workshop_02_5,"Keep the place up and running while I'm away, Centi."
d_ex_workshop_02_6,No problem! Don't worry about me!
d_ex_workshop_02_7,*Ring*
d_ex_workshop_02_8,Welcome!
d_ex_workshop_02_9,Hello.
d_ex_workshop_02_10,"Oh, Commander, you're here too?"
d_ex_workshop_02_11,Always nice running into you.
d_ex_workshop_02_12,What brings you to the workshop?
d_ex_workshop_02_13,Is Liter in?
d_ex_workshop_02_14,I'm here.
d_ex_workshop_02_15,Anything I can help you with?
d_ex_workshop_02_16,"The police baton you made me last time,"
d_ex_workshop_02_17,broke in half.
d_ex_workshop_02_18,Poli holds out a broken police baton.
d_ex_workshop_02_19,What happened? I made it so that it was nearly unbreakable.
d_ex_workshop_02_20,It caught a bullet during a raid on an illegal trading den.
d_ex_workshop_02_21,A gun?
d_ex_workshop_02_22,"I made it sturdy, but not enough to withstand a bullet."
d_ex_workshop_02_23,I was hoping you could repair it?
d_ex_workshop_02_24,"No, I'll make a new one."
d_ex_workshop_02_25,Are you sure?
d_ex_workshop_02_26,I'll get right on it. Wait just a moment.
d_ex_workshop_02_27,What about the business trip?
d_ex_workshop_02_28,Is it even possible to make a baton that quickly?
d_ex_workshop_02_29,Liter always leaves a half-day early just in case.
d_ex_workshop_02_30,There's still plenty of time.
d_ex_workshop_02_31,"We're actually a bit ahead of schedule, so it's no problem."
d_ex_workshop_02_32,"If it's Liter making it, yes."
d_ex_workshop_02_33,The speed she works at is incredible.
d_ex_workshop_02_34,Not to mention the quality of the end product!
d_ex_workshop_02_35,Isn't she amazing?
d_ex_workshop_02_36,"Centi, enough chit-chat. Let's get to work."
d_ex_workshop_02_37,"Yes, ma'am!"
d_ex_workshop_02_38,Later.
d_ex_workshop_02_39,"Liter has created a new, upgraded police baton."
d_ex_workshop_02_40,Hold it up.
d_ex_workshop_02_41,Woah!
d_ex_workshop_02_42,It's way lighter than the last one.
d_ex_workshop_02_43,It should withstand all traditional firearms.
d_ex_workshop_02_44,"Marvelous work Liter, as always."
d_ex_workshop_02_45,Thanks for putting it on rush order!
d_ex_workshop_02_46,"Well, I've got to get going. I'll leave the money here."
d_ex_workshop_02_47,"Take care, Commander!"
d_ex_workshop_02_48,Thank you for your business.
d_ex_workshop_02_49,Poli leaves.
d_ex_workshop_02_50,I'll go get your luggage.
d_ex_workshop_02_51,*Vroom-m-m*
d_ex_workshop_02_52,I know that sound...
d_ex_workshop_02_53,I hear a motorcycle engine turning off.
d_ex_workshop_02_54,*Ring*
d_ex_workshop_02_55,Welcome!
d_ex_workshop_02_56,Are you open?
d_ex_workshop_02_57,"Yes, we are."
d_ex_workshop_02_58,Hey there Partner. You here to order something?
d_ex_workshop_02_59,Nope.
d_ex_workshop_02_60,No.
d_ex_workshop_02_61,...?
d_ex_workshop_02_62,"Anyway, Black Typoon is making some strange noises, so I came in."
d_ex_workshop_02_63,Didn't sound any different to me.
d_ex_workshop_02_64,"Well, it does to me."
d_ex_workshop_02_65,"Usually you can hear it loud and clear, but it's been sounding a bit muffled lately."
d_ex_workshop_02_66,I hear it too. I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is.
d_ex_workshop_02_67,There should be just one part we need to fix. Let's go check it out.
d_ex_workshop_02_68,"Getting straight to it, I like it."
d_ex_workshop_02_69,Later.
d_ex_workshop_02_70,*Vroom-m-m*
d_ex_workshop_02_71,"Liter comes in, as the sound of the motorcycle fades into the distance."
d_ex_workshop_02_72,Phew... we should get going.
d_ex_workshop_02_73,"Centi, bring our bags."
d_ex_workshop_02_74,Yes! Right away!
d_ex_workshop_02_75,...
d_ex_workshop_02_76,Hmm?
d_ex_workshop_02_77,What's the matter?
d_ex_workshop_02_78,You're stretched pretty thin.
d_ex_workshop_02_79,I wouldn't say that.
d_ex_workshop_02_80,I just do what I can. That's all.
d_ex_workshop_02_81,...
d_ex_workshop_02_82,Do I look tired to you?
d_ex_workshop_02_83,You do.
d_ex_workshop_02_84,No. More than anything I'd say you look happier.
d_ex_workshop_02_85,"Well, I've been pretty busy since coming here."
d_ex_workshop_02_86,But no more than I expected to be.
d_ex_workshop_02_87,"Ha, you think so?"
d_ex_workshop_02_88,There's certain happiness to be found in exhaustion.
d_ex_workshop_02_89,A lot of people need me.
d_ex_workshop_02_90,"So if you ever need anything fixed, come visit our shop."
d_ex_workshop_02_91,"Liter, here are your bags!"
d_ex_workshop_02_92,Thank you.
d_ex_workshop_02_93,"All right, we're off then."
d_ex_workshop_02_94,Safe travels!
d_ex_workshop_02_95,Safe travels.
d_ex_workshop_02_96,Liter steps out of the shop with a smile on her face.
d_ex_workshop_03_title,Change of Conception
d_ex_workshop_03_01,"Finally, all the work orders that have been coming in since yesterday are finished."
d_ex_workshop_03_02,It has been a while since I had some free time.
d_ex_workshop_03_03,You were really up to your elbows at work.
d_ex_workshop_03_04,You can say that again.
d_ex_workshop_03_05,"I gave Centi some time off, but I wonder how she's doing."
d_ex_workshop_03_06,*Ring*
d_ex_workshop_03_07,Another customer already?
d_ex_workshop_03_08,"No time to rest, I suppose."
d_ex_workshop_03_09,Is this the shop that can make anything?
d_ex_workshop_03_10,Sure is.
d_ex_workshop_03_11,What'll it be?
d_ex_workshop_03_12,Um...
d_ex_workshop_03_13,Can you make a face mask?
d_ex_workshop_03_14,A face mask?
d_ex_workshop_03_15,Like the one you're wearing now?
d_ex_workshop_03_16,"Yes, something like this one, but"
d_ex_workshop_03_17,one that doesn't feel like it's touching your skin.
d_ex_workshop_03_18,"One that's so comfortable to breathe through, you don't even realize you're wearing a face mask."
d_ex_workshop_03_19,"I'd like for it to be thin, and have a beautiful design as well."
d_ex_workshop_03_20,Hmmm.
d_ex_workshop_03_21,That's not really our area of expertise.
d_ex_workshop_03_22,You may be better off asking Elysion directly.
d_ex_workshop_03_23,Oh...
d_ex_workshop_03_24,"Boss says that the face masks we have right now are extremely dependable, but"
d_ex_workshop_03_25,they're so suffocating! I can't stand them.
d_ex_workshop_03_26,"Anyway, I suppose face masks are a no-go for you."
d_ex_workshop_03_27,Then what about a portable bed?
d_ex_workshop_03_28,You mean like a rollaway bed or a fold-out bed?
d_ex_workshop_03_29,"Those are nice, but I mean a bed small enough to fit in a bag
that you can expand when you need to use it."
d_ex_workshop_03_30,That way I can lie down and rest wherever I want.
d_ex_workshop_03_31,Is that possible?
d_ex_workshop_03_32,Of course not!
d_ex_workshop_03_33,"Ever since you came in here, you've been asking the impossible!"
d_ex_workshop_03_34,"If I could make something like that,
it'd already be a mainstay on the battlefield!"
d_ex_workshop_03_35,"Why don't you ask for a flying carpet while you're at it, or a magic pill to make you grow ten stories tall?"
d_ex_workshop_03_36,A flying carpet? I'm intrigued!
d_ex_workshop_03_37,Could you do that?
d_ex_workshop_03_38,It's like speaking to a wall!
d_ex_workshop_03_39,There's no one on this entire planet who could make that!
d_ex_workshop_03_40,Oh... I guess you're right.
d_ex_workshop_03_41,Turns out that you can't make everything.
d_ex_workshop_03_42,"If you're not going to request something that's even remotely possible to construct,"
d_ex_workshop_03_43,then I suggest you head out.
d_ex_workshop_03_44,You can make it.
d_ex_workshop_03_45,What?
d_ex_workshop_03_46,"You're from Mighty Tools, you can make anything."
d_ex_workshop_03_47,What's so outlandish about the bed she asked for?
d_ex_workshop_03_48,... You think I can make it?
d_ex_workshop_03_49,A bed that fits in your bag so you can lie down and rest any time...
d_ex_workshop_03_50,"If I just think outside the box, I suppose it's not that far-fetched."
d_ex_workshop_03_51,...!
d_ex_workshop_03_52,Ah hah!
d_ex_workshop_03_53,That's right. It's all so simple.
d_ex_workshop_03_54,Wait here a moment.
d_ex_workshop_03_55,A moment later.
d_ex_workshop_03_56,Liter comes back with several iron bars and a piece of cloth.
d_ex_workshop_03_57,What is this?
d_ex_workshop_03_58,Isn't it obvious?
d_ex_workshop_03_59,It's the bed you were asking for.
d_ex_workshop_03_60,You connect the iron bars like this to make a support frame.
d_ex_workshop_03_61,Then you simply hang the cloth in-between them.
d_ex_workshop_03_62,I get it!
d_ex_workshop_03_63,It's like a collapsible hammock.
d_ex_workshop_03_64,"It's easy to disassemble too. Here, you try."
d_ex_workshop_03_65,Maiden's excitement is palpable as she dismantles the hammock.
d_ex_workshop_03_66,Easy as pie! And it's even lighter than I thought.
d_ex_workshop_03_67,I can carry this in my bag no problem.
d_ex_workshop_03_68,I guess you guys can make anything here after all.
d_ex_workshop_03_69,Thank you. Now I can sneak in some cat naps when the Boss isn't looking.
d_ex_workshop_03_70,"Um, well... how you decide to use it is up to you."
d_ex_workshop_03_71,"If you want to thank anyone, thank Greenhorn over here."
d_ex_workshop_03_72,Huh? Why me?
d_ex_workshop_03_73,"If it weren't for you, I'd have never tried making this."
d_ex_workshop_03_74,"I was being too close-minded, until you lit the fires of inspiration."
d_ex_workshop_03_75,"If I'd given up because I thought it was impossible to make, we'd have lost a customer."
d_ex_workshop_03_76,Thank you Commander.
d_ex_workshop_03_77,"Because of you, I found a new way to slack off."
d_ex_workshop_03_78,... You're welcome?
d_ex_workshop_03_79,I gotta go find someplace to test this baby out!
d_ex_workshop_03_80,*Ring*
d_ex_workshop_03_81,"Hehe, I've been building and tinkering for as long as I can remember, but I guess I still have a lot to learn."
d_ex_workshop_03_82,"Now that I have some free time, I think I'll use it to do some studying."
d_ex_workshop_03_83,Care to help me?
d_ex_workshop_03_84,Of course.
d_ex_workshop_03_85,Liter and I studied all sorts of useful topics.
d_ex_church_04_title,Ain't No Half-Steppin'
d_ex_church_04_1,"Hey, didn't you mention"
d_ex_church_04_2,there was something on the schedule that would put some pep in your step?
d_ex_church_04_3,Yes.
d_ex_church_04_4,And it's at a church?
d_ex_church_04_5,"I don't have to pray or anything, do I?"
d_ex_church_04_6,Of course not.
d_ex_church_04_7,Then what am I supposed to do here?
d_ex_church_04_8,"Vesti, Mica! I brought her."
d_ex_church_04_9,What?
d_ex_church_04_10,ohmygodi cantbleievi it*(#!R
d_ex_church_04_11,It's actually her!
d_ex_church_04_12,...
d_ex_church_04_13,Care to tell me what's going on here?
d_ex_church_04_14,"Miss Volume,"
d_ex_church_04_15,how can we get better at arguing?
d_ex_church_04_16,Arguing? Why are you asking me?
d_ex_church_04_17,Old-Timer says you never lose an argument to anyone.
d_ex_church_04_18,"So I thought if you taught me some of the rap basics, I could win an argument with Belorta."
d_ex_church_04_19,I also heard that you're the top rapper in the entire Ark.
d_ex_church_04_20,"You'll say whatever's on your mind to anyone, even if they're dangerous."
d_ex_church_04_21,You could even stand up to Eunhwa.
d_ex_church_04_22,Let me get this straight.
d_ex_church_04_23,You want me to teach you how to rap so that you can best someone in an argument?
d_ex_church_04_24,"Exactly! Just for once, I'd like to beat her."
d_ex_church_04_25,Same here! I want to win against Belorta!
d_ex_church_04_26,"Jesus, give me strength. Since when did rap battles become equated with arguments?"
d_ex_church_04_27,I don't do that kind of stuff. I have nothing to teach you.
d_ex_church_04_28,You're not?
d_ex_church_04_29,But I've been waiting so long for this day...
d_ex_church_04_30,All I want is to hold my own when talking to Eunhwa.
d_ex_church_04_31,Why even try learning how to argue?
d_ex_church_04_32,Just say what's on your mind. It's that simple.
d_ex_church_04_33,"Well, it's just that Eunhwa is really intimidating, so... I'm afraid."
d_ex_church_04_34,Me too.
d_ex_church_04_35,"If courage is what you're lacking, then that's what you should be working on."
d_ex_church_04_36,What are you doing in a church anyway?
d_ex_church_04_37,Planning on using prayer as a backup if I didn't teach you?
d_ex_church_04_38,"Eunhwa would never set foot inside a church,"
d_ex_church_04_39,so it's a good place to practice in secret.
d_ex_church_04_40,"Same with Belorta. She thinks churches are boring. ""Nothing to make fun of"" she says."
d_ex_church_04_41,"Well, praise the Lord! I've seen the light."
d_ex_church_04_42,What a bunch of scaredy cats you two are.
d_ex_church_04_43,...
d_ex_church_04_44,...
d_ex_church_04_45,*Sigh*
d_ex_church_04_46,"If you don't want to teach us, we can look for someone else... sorry to bother you."
d_ex_church_04_47,D-don't worry about us.
d_ex_church_04_48,Th-that's right. We'll be fine.
d_ex_church_04_49,We'll find someone else to teach us.
d_ex_church_04_50,So you think learning how to rap will help give you courage?
d_ex_church_04_51,Is that it?
d_ex_church_04_52,Yes...
d_ex_church_04_53,"Fine, let's do this."
d_ex_church_04_54,"First off, wipe that meek expression off your face."
d_ex_church_04_55,"Yes, Miss Volume!"
d_ex_church_04_56,And don't call me Miss Volume anymore!
d_ex_church_04_57,"Yes, Volume!"
d_ex_church_04_58,Better.
d_ex_church_04_59,Manager. Is the beat ready?
d_ex_church_04_60,Play the music Volume prepared.
d_ex_church_04_61,Beatbox using your mouth.
d_ex_church_04_62,Boomboota- Boomboota-! Puschepuschepusche~
d_ex_church_04_63,"For God's sake, stop! It's like nails on a chalkboard."
d_ex_church_04_64,Are you kidding me?
d_ex_church_04_65,"You can't honestly expect me to rap with that, do you?"
d_ex_church_04_66,Quit screwing around.
d_ex_church_04_67,!!
d_ex_church_04_68,Played the music Volume prepared.
d_ex_church_04_69,*Boomboom- pop-* *Boombomm- pop-*
d_ex_church_04_70,The music started flowing out from the speakers installed inside the church.
d_ex_church_04_71,"Listen up, kids!"
d_ex_church_04_72,Rap is in your soul.
d_ex_church_04_73,"Let the beat move within you,"
d_ex_church_04_74,summon up that courage and say what's on your mind!
d_ex_church_04_75,Say whatever we want...?
d_ex_church_04_76,Yes!
d_ex_church_04_77,Everything you've wanted to say to Belorta and Eunhwa.
d_ex_church_04_78,Don't be a wimp! Spit it out!
d_ex_church_04_79,I've always wanted to say...
d_ex_church_04_80,Ah-hah!
d_ex_church_04_81,"D-don't mess with me, you big meanie!"
d_ex_church_04_82,I've had enough of your pranks!
d_ex_church_04_83,That's it! You're getting the hang of it.
d_ex_church_04_84,But if I said this in front of Eunhwa...
d_ex_church_04_85,Belorta's pranks would only get worse...
d_ex_church_04_86,Stop!
d_ex_church_04_87,"What are you, a pair of philosophers? I thought not. So quit thinking!"
d_ex_church_04_88,Get rid of all those thoughts.
d_ex_church_04_89,All they're doing is holding you back.
d_ex_church_04_90,!!
d_ex_church_04_91,!!
d_ex_church_04_92,"I don't care how mean the prank was, just get it out of your mind."
d_ex_church_04_93,All you should be thinking about are the words you'll put to this beat.
d_ex_church_04_94,"Right, beats and words. Uh... yo yo Eunhwa, boom-boom don't mess with me...?"
d_ex_church_04_95,Boomboom... er... cut the pranks?
d_ex_church_04_96,Stop! Stop!
d_ex_church_04_97,"Both of you, watch and learn."
d_ex_church_04_98,"My mind is my tool,"
d_ex_church_04_99,"the beat is my weapon,"
d_ex_church_04_100,ain't no half-steppin'!
d_ex_church_04_101,Do we...
d_ex_church_04_102,Just say that?
d_ex_church_04_103,"Yes, say it!"
d_ex_church_04_104,M-my mind is my tool...
d_ex_church_04_105,the beat is my w-weapon...
d_ex_church_04_106,ain't no half-steppin'!
d_ex_church_04_107,ain't no one breakin' my stride!
d_ex_church_04_108,"Not you too, Manager."
d_ex_church_04_109,That was so boring!
d_ex_church_04_110,Try mixing it up!
d_ex_church_04_111,"Nice, nice!"
d_ex_church_04_112,Switch up the lyrics and just go with the flow.
d_ex_church_04_113,These beats are my tools... uh..prank!
d_ex_church_04_114,ain't no full-steppin... er... swig!
d_ex_church_04_115,Swiggity swag!
d_ex_church_04_116,Good! More confidence! Say whatever comes to mind.
d_ex_church_04_117,I've had enough of your pranks!
d_ex_church_04_118,"Don't mess with me, you big meanie!"
d_ex_church_04_119,"I say what I want, and I make it look good."
d_ex_church_04_120,"Yeeee! That's what I'm talking about, kids!"
d_ex_church_04_121,Let's keep it going! Can't touch this!
d_ex_church_04_122,Can't touch this!
d_ex_church_04_123,Can't touch this!
d_ex_church_04_124,We continued freestyling all night long.
d_ex_library_04_title,The Ordeal of Public Places
d_ex_library_04_1,I'm at the library preparing a report for my superior.
d_ex_library_04_2,Andersen will have my hide if I don't have this in by tomorrow.
d_ex_library_04_3,Gotta focus. Let's get this done.
d_ex_library_04_4,...
d_ex_library_04_5,???
d_ex_library_04_6,*Crumble crumble*
d_ex_library_04_7,Beeeep-?
d_ex_library_04_8,"No, that's not right..."
d_ex_library_04_9,The ultimate score would be more...
d_ex_library_04_10,Beeeep-? Beep-?
d_ex_library_04_11,...
d_ex_library_04_12,Go and tell whoever it is to keep quiet.
d_ex_library_04_13,Ignore it and continue working.
d_ex_library_04_14,*Crumble crumble crumble crumble crumble*
d_ex_library_04_15,Beeep---? beep- beep-?
d_ex_library_04_16,That sound isn't right either. *Sigh* What a mess...
d_ex_library_04_17,Go and tell whoever it is to keep quiet.
d_ex_library_04_18,Beebeeep-? Beep beep-?
d_ex_library_04_19,"Excuse me, could you keep it down?"
d_ex_library_04_20,... Conductor?
d_ex_library_04_21,"I'm sorry, but I can't do that."
d_ex_library_04_22,Not until I find the treasure which awaits me within this vast library.
d_ex_library_04_23,"Until then, I must continue my search."
d_ex_library_04_24,What are you talking about?
d_ex_library_04_25,...
d_ex_library_04_26,I heard there was a musical score hidden in this library.
d_ex_library_04_27,One composed by the old masters. Just playing it once is like
d_ex_library_04_28,stepping back in time and into the shoes of a master violinist of old.
d_ex_library_04_29,My mission is to pass on music from the olden days.
d_ex_library_04_30,I cannot allow such a precious melody to fall into obscurity.
d_ex_library_04_31,What you said...
d_ex_library_04_32,is it true?
d_ex_library_04_33,Aria?
d_ex_library_04_34,You sound surprised. Is it so weird to see me here?
d_ex_library_04_35,Can't opera singers can come to the library?
d_ex_library_04_36,"I come by whenever I have questions about a play we're putting on, or whenever I need some inspiration."
d_ex_library_04_37,"But enough about me. Julia, if you could please answer my question."
d_ex_library_04_38,Is there really a score of a great master here?
d_ex_library_04_39,...
d_ex_library_04_40,"Yes, there is."
d_ex_library_04_41,Would it be possible for you to let me have it?
d_ex_library_04_42,"Sorry. As an undying devotee of music, I cannot allow that."
d_ex_library_04_43,How about we share it then?
d_ex_library_04_44,What?
d_ex_library_04_45,I heard you playing through all the musical scores in this library.
d_ex_library_04_46,"At your current pace, you'll never finish them all."
d_ex_library_04_47,And you can't ask anyone else for help either.
d_ex_library_04_48,"Most people are unable to read ancient sheet music, and even if they did, they wouldn't know how to play it."
d_ex_library_04_49,But I do.
d_ex_library_04_50,"I'm a lead opera singer, an ancient art form in its own right."
d_ex_library_04_51,Reading a difficult score is as easy as singing a C4.
d_ex_library_04_52,...!!
d_ex_library_04_53,Do you also wish to set sail with me
d_ex_library_04_54,on this perilous journey over the vast and tumultuous sea of melody?
d_ex_library_04_55,... I think so?
d_ex_library_04_56,"Anyway, once we find that score,"
d_ex_library_04_57,you and I will perform it together.
d_ex_library_04_58,We'll hold a grand concert at the Royal Road opera house.
d_ex_library_04_59,...
d_ex_library_04_60,"Yes, yes!"
d_ex_library_04_61,"Like a breeze that blows in early spring, like fresh leaves sprouting in early summer,"
d_ex_library_04_62,my soul has been bestowed with a new hope.
d_ex_library_04_63,"I will accept your offer, Aria."
d_ex_library_04_64,"With our music, we shall sing the praises of past glories in spectacular fashion."
d_ex_library_04_65,"Sounds wonderful, my dear violinist."
d_ex_library_04_66,...
d_ex_library_04_67,I don't have time for this. Back to my report.
d_ex_library_04_68,*Crumble crumble crumble crumble crumble*
d_ex_library_04_69,Beeep-?
d_ex_library_04_70,"Lalalala la~? 
Lala Lala La~?"
d_ex_library_04_71,Beep Beeeeeeeee~~?
d_ex_library_04_72,Rwaaaaaaaaaah~!??
d_ex_library_04_73,The next morning.
d_ex_library_04_74,"After staying up all night, I submit my report. I feel like death warmed over."
d_ex_library_04_75,*Beep*
m_ex_library_04_1,"You,"
m_ex_library_04_2,"I hate to lecture a battle-hardened commander over paperwork,"
m_ex_library_04_3,but what is going on with this report?
m_ex_library_04_4,"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you just cobbled it together on the elevator ride up here."
m_ex_library_04_5,"I don't care how many successful missions you've been a part of,"
m_ex_library_04_6,I won't accept such haphazard reports.
m_ex_library_04_7,It wasn't my fault.
m_ex_library_04_8,There was no reply from Andersen for a while.
m_ex_library_04_9,"Sorry, I don't think I heard you. Could you repeat that?"
m_ex_library_04_10,"I assure you, this was the best I could do under the circumstances."
d_ex_shopping_04_title,A Hip Girl?
d_ex_shopping_04_1,Hmmm...
d_ex_shopping_04_2,"This outfit looks nice,"
d_ex_shopping_04_3,but so does this one.
d_ex_shopping_04_4,Hmmm... they're subtly different.
d_ex_shopping_04_5,Maiden?
d_ex_shopping_04_6,C-Commander?!
d_ex_shopping_04_7,What are you doing here?
d_ex_shopping_04_8,I'm just here to try on some clothes.
d_ex_shopping_04_9,Looking for anything specific?
d_ex_shopping_04_10,"Yes,"
d_ex_shopping_04_11,but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.
d_ex_shopping_04_12,What did you have in mind?
d_ex_shopping_04_13,Well...
d_ex_shopping_04_14,*Rustle*
d_ex_shopping_04_15,Maiden takes out a crumpled-up piece of paper and opens it up.
d_ex_shopping_04_16,A long white coat that comes down to the knees. Something that makes you look like a skilled healer.
d_ex_shopping_04_17,Boots that could handle rugged terrain on any adventure.
d_ex_shopping_04_18,And...
d_ex_shopping_04_19,Sounds like a costume from Final Quest.
d_ex_shopping_04_20,Yes! Exactly!
d_ex_shopping_04_21,"Hey, Manager!"
d_ex_shopping_04_22,What are you doing here?
d_ex_shopping_04_23,I could ask you the same question.
d_ex_shopping_04_24,"I'm here to shop, duh."
d_ex_shopping_04_25,I heard they've got some killer deals going on.
d_ex_shopping_04_26,"Tell me, Manager, what are you doing here with another girl?"
d_ex_shopping_04_27,"Hey, cool face mask!"
d_ex_shopping_04_28,"Oh, me?"
d_ex_shopping_04_29,Very hip.
d_ex_shopping_04_30,You think so?
d_ex_shopping_04_31,What are you doing in this store?
d_ex_shopping_04_32,"If your chic clothes and mask are any indication,"
d_ex_shopping_04_33,I don't think you're gonna find anything up your alley here.
d_ex_shopping_04_34,Well...
d_ex_shopping_04_35,This place only sells casual wear.
d_ex_shopping_04_36,The type of clothes you're wearing is on the floor above us.
d_ex_shopping_04_37,"Actually, I'm not looking for something like this..."
d_ex_shopping_04_38,"Wait, you're not self-conscious, are you?"
d_ex_shopping_04_39,I don't believe it!
d_ex_shopping_04_40,How can you be self-conscious when you're wearing such provocative clothes?
d_ex_shopping_04_41,Have more faith in yourself!
d_ex_shopping_04_42,"No, what I mean is..."
d_ex_shopping_04_43,What are you looking for?
d_ex_shopping_04_44,Volume takes a look at Maiden's note.
d_ex_shopping_04_45,A fantasy character?
d_ex_shopping_04_46,Is this for a movie or something?
d_ex_shopping_04_47,Um...
d_ex_shopping_04_48,Maiden quickly hides the paper behind her.
d_ex_shopping_04_49,I-it's nothing!!
d_ex_shopping_04_50,Maiden ran away.
d_ex_shopping_04_51,What is this?
d_ex_shopping_04_52,What was that all about?
d_ex_shopping_04_53,Maybe she's a little embarrassed about her preferences.
d_ex_shopping_04_54,When she's running around wearing something like that?
d_ex_shopping_04_55,I don't think so.
d_ex_shopping_04_56,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_title,The Golden Voice
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_2,This is it.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_3,This is where I heard someone with a golden voice.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_4,... Here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_5,Yes. I know I heard a voice that could only belong to someone with true talent.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_6,"You're not off on one of your whacky adventures again, are you?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_7,You're telling me there's someone here who could be the next opera star?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_8,Yes. I was passing by this club yesterday night and I heard it.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_9,A voice capable of hitting the highest of notes.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_10,Are you sure you've got the right place?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_11,Wait a minute...
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_12,Haha.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_13,I think that might have been me.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_14,I was enjoying myself yesterday and I may have gotten carried away with my singing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_15,!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_16,Pretty sure I'm the one you're looking for.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_17,Hmph...
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_18,"Aria slowly closed her eyes, then reopened them."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_19,... I see.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_20,It's definitely similar to the voice I heard yesterday night.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_21,So you're the singer I was searching for.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_22,No kidding!
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_23,Feels nice to get some recognition for my singing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_24,But...I was just singing an ordinary song last night.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_25,Saying I'm a top talent may be taking it a bit far.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_26,Fair enough.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_27,I understand.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_28,Understand what?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_29,"Yeah, I'm curious as well."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_30,Care to fill us in?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_31,The whip hanging on the wall. The leather belt around your waist. The menu is full of innuendos.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_32,"From what I've seen so far, I can only come to one conclusion."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_33,"For you, singing is about pain."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_34,"You're not wrong, but there is one subtle thing you missed."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_35,It's not all about pain.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_36,What is it then?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_37,Pain and pleasure.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_38,Balancing that razor-thin line between pleasure and pain.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_39,Crossing the line over and over...nothing is more thrilling.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_40,It's enough to make me burst out in song.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_41,The way you describe all of this...
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_42,I find it all very intriguing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_43,!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_44,"Really? If you're curious, I could give you a little taste..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_45,No thanks.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_46,"Hehe, too bad."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_47,I wanted you to feel the same pleasure that I do.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_48,"Sorry, but S&M isn't my thing."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_49,!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_50,So you did know what Mihara was talking about.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_51,"Maestro, I'm no fool."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_52,Of course I knew.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_53,"Even when you knew what I was getting at, you still told me I had potential."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_54,You're not as callous as people say. You're a real sweetheart.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_55,I wasn't blowing smoke up your posterior.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_56,"Regardless of your initial reasons for singing, it's true that you have potential."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_57,!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_58,You have a nice singing voice.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_59,You may want to consider dipping your toes into opera.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_60,That's all I wanted to tell you.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_61,"Hehe, you may not think so, but I still say you're really sweet."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_62,"Don't you think so, Commander?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_63,Absolutely.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_64,Erm...
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_65,What is that?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_66,"I'm not sure I entirely understand, but"
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_67,I only came here today to tell you that.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_68,"Now that I've said what I came to say, I'll be on my way."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_69,"Hey, don't run off! We've got a good crowd tonight."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_70,"Both of you, stay for a drink."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_71,It's on the house.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_72,Isn't everything here alcoholic?
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_73,"I don't drink, so I won't be able to have anything."
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_74,Not at all. I've got a few non-alcoholic options available.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_75,I'll get you one.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_76,Very well.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_77,I'm not one to turn down a good thing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_78,Hehe. Thanks.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_79,"Commander, what would you like?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_80,Something stiff.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_81,Get me something nonalcoholic as well.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_82,Coming right up.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_83,"Chill music plays inside the club,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_84,and the glasses sitting atop the bar rattle softly.
d_ex_mysteryclub_04_85,"Meanwhile, the quiet hum of Mihara's singing can be heard throughout."

d_ex_clothingstore_04_3,Alice?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_4,No response.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_5,Alice?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_6,No response.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_7,Ludmilla?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_8,...
d_ex_clothingstore_04_9,Total silence.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_10,No one appears to be in the shop.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_11,I'll come back next ti...
d_ex_clothingstore_04_12,*Ding*
d_ex_clothingstore_04_13,Look how tiny this place is! There's no way they have what I'm looking for.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_14,You never know. It's not the size of the store that determines the quality of the goods.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_15,"Whatever. If I don't like it, I can just lea..."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_16,?!!
d_ex_clothingstore_04_17,Producer?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_18,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_19,"We're here to buy clothes, what else?"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_20,Why are you here? Do you work here?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_21,I'm waiting for the owner to show up.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_22,The owner isn't here?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_23,"So you're here all alone, but the store is still open?"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_24,Sounds a little strange if you ask me.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_25,Why would I lie to you?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_26,"All right, I believe you."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_27,But isn't this a clothing store? Aren't you buying anything?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_28,They don't sell clothes here.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_29,"This is a clothing store, and you're telling me they don't sell clothes?"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_30,Then what is this place?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_31,It's a place for the owner to indulge in her hobbies.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_32,Come again?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_33,"She was so into her hobbies, that she opened up an entire store dedicated to them."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_34,There are many things in this world
d_ex_clothingstore_04_35,that I fail to comprehend.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_36,What kind of clothes were you looking for?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_37,Just some casual wear.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_38,"That's why I thought this place would have some, even if it's small."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_39,I'm looking for something more punk rock.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_40,I hope to find some gowns to wear on stage.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_41,You all have very different preferences.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_42,Don't act surprised.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_43,One look at our music should tell you as much.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_44,Or are you surprised that we're all hanging out together?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_45,"No, I'm surprised that you all aren't fighting."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_46,"Oh, believe me, we fight."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_47,"Actually, we haven't had a big fight in a while..."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_48,I think we're cool with each other...right?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_49,I think we're just fine.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_50,"No matter which genre we prefer, in the end we all do the same thing: music."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_51,That's right. We also understand how much effort each of us puts into our music.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_52,"Y'know, mutual respect and all that."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_53,Effort? I don't have to put any effort into my music.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_54,Hah...right. Sure thing.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_55,Is there anything else that you all like?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_56,"Sure. Something we discovered recently, as a matter of fact."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_57,Something that has nothing to do with music.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_58,Can you guess what it is?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_59,Hmph...
d_ex_clothingstore_04_60,Aria gazes in my direction.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_61,... That's right.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_62,Mhmm!
d_ex_clothingstore_04_63,Who knew our tastes would align when it came to this sort of thing.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_64,"Wait, taste in what?"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_65,Are you talking about me?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_66,"You, you big goober!"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_67,Me?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_68,Bingo.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_69,It means you are capable.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_70,???
d_ex_clothingstore_04_71,"Manager, stop acting stupid and let's go."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_72,Go? Where?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_73,Haha! Have you not been listening to this the whole time?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_74,We're going shopping.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_75,You should come too.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_76,Why?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_77,Because we said so.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_78,It's not like you have anything else to do.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_79,Wouldn't it be nice if we go together?
d_ex_clothingstore_04_80,It'd certainly be better than
d_ex_clothingstore_04_81,staying in this empty shop for no good reason
d_ex_clothingstore_04_82,and having people think you're some kind of weirdo.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_83,... I'll go.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_84,A wise choice.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_85,Let's get this show on the road. I'm getting bored.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_86,Aria and Volume left the store.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_87,"There's no need to be upset, Producer."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_88,You're the only person our entire squad wants to be with.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_89,"You know what that means, don't you?"
d_ex_clothingstore_04_90,"... Yes, I know."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_91,"No, I don't."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_92,Good!
d_ex_clothingstore_04_93,"Oh, that's too bad..."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_94,"Anyway, we should get going."
d_ex_clothingstore_04_95,Noise ran out of the store.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_96,I followed her out.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_97,We had to circle around the mall multiple times so that everyone could find something that suited their preferences.
d_ex_clothingstore_04_98,...
d_ex_clothingstore_04_99,My legs felt like they were about to give out.
d_ex_hotel_04_title,Scary Shower Story
d_ex_hotel_04_1,"*Stomp, stomp*"
d_ex_hotel_04_2,All we can hear are our own footsteps echoing in the silent hotel hallway.
d_ex_hotel_04_3,...
d_ex_hotel_04_4,...
d_ex_hotel_04_5,We stop in front of the entrance to a hotel room.
d_ex_hotel_04_6,... Is it here?
d_ex_hotel_04_7,Yes.
d_ex_hotel_04_8,Let's go in.
d_ex_hotel_04_9,*Squeak*
d_ex_hotel_04_10,The door makes a loud noise as it opens.
d_ex_hotel_04_11,Ahhhhh!!
d_ex_hotel_04_12,!!
d_ex_hotel_04_13,!!
d_ex_hotel_04_14,"Jeez, you scared me! I thought you were Helm... I mean a bunch of ghosts!"
d_ex_hotel_04_15,Anis? What are you doing here?
d_ex_hotel_04_16,Um... I'm just...
d_ex_hotel_04_17,I really wanted to sleep at a hotel...
d_ex_hotel_04_18,"I was wondering what it'd be like to stay at a hotel for no particular reason, and sleep somewhere really luxurious for a change."
d_ex_hotel_04_19,... I see.
d_ex_hotel_04_20,What are you all doing at a hotel anyway?
d_ex_hotel_04_21,...
d_ex_hotel_04_22,...
d_ex_hotel_04_23,... Commander?
d_ex_hotel_04_24,...
d_ex_hotel_04_25,Are you crazy?! Coming here to do that sort of thing in broad daylight?!
d_ex_hotel_04_26,"I have no idea what you're thinking, but I can guarantee it's not that."
d_ex_hotel_04_27,I just came here to use the shower.
d_ex_hotel_04_28,Don't lie to me! I saw you holding hands when you came in here! Save the hanky-panky for the Commander's Room!
d_ex_hotel_04_29,??
d_ex_hotel_04_30,You're saying I should take a shower in the Commander's Room?
d_ex_hotel_04_31,"Now you're taking it too far, Anis. Why, it's practically unthinkable."
d_ex_hotel_04_32,...
d_ex_hotel_04_33,I came here because I heard it has a functioning shower.
d_ex_hotel_04_34,"If it's not too much trouble, could I use it?"
d_ex_hotel_04_35,Do whatever you want. Just keep it down so I don't wake up.
d_ex_hotel_04_36,*Splashhhhh*
d_ex_hotel_04_37,"Suddenly, the sound of the shower running can be heard."
d_ex_hotel_04_38,...?
d_ex_hotel_04_39,...?
d_ex_hotel_04_40,Is someone in the shower?
d_ex_hotel_04_41,"Hey! I don't know who you are, but this isn't a bed and breakfast!"
d_ex_hotel_04_42,You can't just waltz in here and use the facilities as you please!
d_ex_hotel_04_43,...
d_ex_hotel_04_44,*Splashhhhh*
d_ex_hotel_04_45,Huh? They're acting as if they can't hear me.
d_ex_hotel_04_46,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_47,Anis opens the door to the shower.
d_ex_hotel_04_48,Hey. Are you not lis...
d_ex_hotel_04_49,... tening?
d_ex_hotel_04_50,There is no one in the shower.
d_ex_hotel_04_51,What the...
d_ex_hotel_04_52,But... didn't you guys just hear the shower running?
d_ex_hotel_04_53,I heard it.
d_ex_hotel_04_54,The floor isn't even wet.
d_ex_hotel_04_55,What's going on here? Maybe I'm just imagining things because I love being able to shower any time I want.
d_ex_hotel_04_56,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_57,The door to the shower closes.
d_ex_hotel_04_58,"Anyway, like I said. You can take a shower, just keep it dow..."
d_ex_hotel_04_59,*Splashhhhh*
d_ex_hotel_04_60,...
d_ex_hotel_04_61,...
d_ex_hotel_04_62,Hey! Who is that?!
d_ex_hotel_04_63,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_64,The shower is still empty and the floor is still dry.
d_ex_hotel_04_65,...
d_ex_hotel_04_66,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_67,The door to the shower closes.
d_ex_hotel_04_68,What is this?
d_ex_hotel_04_69,...
d_ex_hotel_04_70,I think it's best you don't say anything and just leave.
d_ex_hotel_04_71,Why?
d_ex_hotel_04_72,*Splat*
d_ex_hotel_04_73,!!
d_ex_hotel_04_74,Commander... what does that sound like to you?
d_ex_hotel_04_75,Wet footsteps.
d_ex_hotel_04_76,That's what I thought.
d_ex_hotel_04_77,"I don't know about you, but I'm not keen on meeting any paranormal entities today. Let's get the heck out of here."
d_ex_hotel_04_78,"*Splat, splat*"
d_ex_hotel_04_79,"*Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat*"
d_ex_hotel_04_80,"*Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat*
*Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat*"
d_ex_hotel_04_81,Aaaagggh!
d_ex_hotel_04_82,"Anis, calm down."
d_ex_hotel_04_83,How do you expect me to calm down?!
d_ex_hotel_04_84,Ghosts aren't real.
d_ex_hotel_04_85,There has to be a scientific explanation for that sound.
d_ex_hotel_04_86,"Don't try and act smart! You don't have the faintest clue where that sound's coming from, just like the rest of us."
d_ex_hotel_04_87,"Here, I'll open it. Will that make it better?"
d_ex_hotel_04_88,I-I don't think that's a good idea.
d_ex_hotel_04_89,"Trust me, Anis."
d_ex_hotel_04_90,There's no such thing as ghosts.
d_ex_hotel_04_91,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_92,...
d_ex_hotel_04_93,Wh-what is it?
d_ex_hotel_04_94,...
d_ex_hotel_04_95,"I-it's nothing, right? There's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this, isn't there?"
d_ex_hotel_04_96,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_04_97,The door to the shower closes.
d_ex_hotel_04_98,... We have to get out of here.
d_ex_hotel_04_99,*Splat*
d_ex_hotel_04_100,... What was it?
d_ex_hotel_04_101,"*Splat, splat*"
d_ex_hotel_04_102,... Wet hand prints.
d_ex_hotel_04_103,"*Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat*
*Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat, splat*"
d_ex_hotel_04_104,...
d_ex_hotel_04_105,...
d_ex_hotel_04_106,... We're leaving.
d_ex_hotel_04_107,"Trying to make as little noise as possible, the three of us creep out of the hotel."
d_ex_hotel_04_108,I think it's for the best not to use the hotel's shower.
d_ex_trainstation_04_title,The Best of the Best
d_ex_trainstation_04_1,"Hey Coach, are you busy?"
d_ex_trainstation_04_2,I'm always free.
d_ex_trainstation_04_3,I'm always busy.
d_ex_trainstation_04_4,It certainly seems that way.
d_ex_trainstation_04_5,... It certainly doesn't look like it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_6,"... All right, I've got nothing going on."
d_ex_trainstation_04_7,I knew it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_8,Come with me.
d_ex_trainstation_04_9,Where to?
d_ex_trainstation_04_10,The garage at the train station.
d_ex_trainstation_04_11,"A part from my board broke, and I'm having a hard time finding a replacement."
d_ex_trainstation_04_12,"Since the AZX is at the train station, I figured they'd have plenty of parts."
d_ex_trainstation_04_13,Is there really a need for me to go as well?
d_ex_trainstation_04_14,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_15,You said you were free.
d_ex_trainstation_04_16,Got it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_17,In the garage of the train station.
d_ex_trainstation_04_18,Any chance I can use this part? I really need it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_19,"Sure, I've got a couple of spares in the back."
d_ex_trainstation_04_20,But there's a beta type and a gamma type. I'm not sure which will fit your board.
d_ex_trainstation_04_21,Hmm... I'm sure both would fit.
d_ex_trainstation_04_22,I'd go for the gamma type if I were you.
d_ex_trainstation_04_23,Huh? Helm?
d_ex_trainstation_04_24,What brings you here?
d_ex_trainstation_04_25,"I came to see the AZX. It's something of a companion to the Admire, so I actually come here fairly often."
d_ex_trainstation_04_26,"... Actually, the Admire isn't something I can see whenever I want."
d_ex_trainstation_04_27,"Hey Helm, how're you doing?"
d_ex_trainstation_04_28,What makes you recommend the gamma type? I think beta would fit better.
d_ex_trainstation_04_29,Because that's what the Admire uses.
d_ex_trainstation_04_30,... Ships and boards aren't exactly the same thing.
d_ex_trainstation_04_31,"Epinel. The Admire is the strongest ship there is, yes or no?"
d_ex_trainstation_04_32,Um... yes?
d_ex_trainstation_04_33,The parts used by the strongest are also the strongest. So just use the gamma type.
d_ex_trainstation_04_34,"Wait! When you put it like that, I must disagree."
d_ex_trainstation_04_35,"The AZX uses beta parts, so I think it's safe to say that they've got the better performance."
d_ex_trainstation_04_36,... Let me get this straight. Are you saying that the AZX is better than the Admire?
d_ex_trainstation_04_37,What if I am? It's not like that's such an outrageous statement.
d_ex_trainstation_04_38,"I'm not saying the AZX isn't impressive, but it doesn't hold a candle to our ship."
d_ex_trainstation_04_39,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_40,What's the top speed of the Admire?
d_ex_trainstation_04_41,That's not fair. It's a seafaring vessel.
d_ex_trainstation_04_42,"I'm well aware of that. Now tell me, how fast?"
d_ex_trainstation_04_43,"... The AZX uses traditional ammunition, doesn't it?
The Admire uses particle cannons."
d_ex_trainstation_04_44,Which take forever and a day to recharge.
d_ex_trainstation_04_45,And blow Tyrant-class Raptures to smithereens in the blink of an eye.
d_ex_trainstation_04_46,"Those pea shooters of yours wouldn't even put a dent in the AZX's armor. From what I hear, the Admire might as well be made of paper-mâché."
d_ex_trainstation_04_47,"It wouldn't ever get hit to begin with, thanks to our anti-aircraft guns."
d_ex_trainstation_04_48,The only reason you need anti-aircraft guns is because you're too scared to be in the thick of it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_49,Everyone knows the most powerful weapons are kept on the rear flanks.
d_ex_trainstation_04_50,"Oh, is that right? Well, let me tell you..."
d_ex_trainstation_04_51,Helm and Brid both start to raise their voices.
d_ex_trainstation_04_52,Don't you think you should stop them?
d_ex_trainstation_04_53,Me?
d_ex_trainstation_04_54,"You're the commander.
You should mediate any disputes between Nikkes."
d_ex_trainstation_04_55,... All right.
d_ex_trainstation_04_56,Helm. Brid. That's enough.
d_ex_trainstation_04_57,??
d_ex_trainstation_04_58,??
d_ex_trainstation_04_59,Epinel will select the part.
d_ex_trainstation_04_60,... Huh?
d_ex_trainstation_04_61,Perfect! That'll settle it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_62,Right. Whichever part Epinel selects will decide who's the strongest.
d_ex_trainstation_04_63,Beta parts used by the AZX.
d_ex_trainstation_04_64,Gamma parts used by the Admire.
d_ex_trainstation_04_65,What'll it be?
d_ex_trainstation_04_66,Well?
d_ex_trainstation_04_67,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_68,I-I think the AZX and the Admire are both impressive in their own right.
d_ex_trainstation_04_69,The Admire has incredible firepower which can intercept enemies and allow our allies safe passage on the high seas.
d_ex_trainstation_04_70,"Meanwhile, the AZX is the fastest train the world has ever seen and helps transport troops and supplies with lightning speed."
d_ex_trainstation_04_71,I can't say which is stronger than the other.
d_ex_trainstation_04_72,I think they're both the strongest at what they specialize in.
d_ex_trainstation_04_73,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_74,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_75,She's right. You can't compare the AZX to anything else.
d_ex_trainstation_04_76,Same goes for the Admire.
d_ex_trainstation_04_77,Let's just keep rockin' it in our own special way.
d_ex_trainstation_04_78,You said it.
d_ex_trainstation_04_79,"The two shake hands, their eyes burning with passion."
d_ex_trainstation_04_80,*Sigh*
d_ex_trainstation_04_81,Brilliant.
d_ex_trainstation_04_82,...
d_ex_trainstation_04_83,Please.
d_ex_trainstation_04_84,You barely did anything.
d_ex_trainstation_04_85,...
d_ex_armory_04_title,Pawn Shop Women
d_ex_armory_04_1,Is there something that looks similar?
d_ex_armory_04_2,"Hmm... For now, it doesn't really seem like it."
d_ex_armory_04_3,"That's why you need to be sure of the material.
Just look at it. It's clearly hand-made."
d_ex_armory_04_4,"No, I've seen this gun before. I'm telling you, it came out of a factory."
d_ex_armory_04_5,How can that be possible when it doesn't have a serial number?
d_ex_armory_04_6,"Stop bickering, you two. Let's think this through."
d_ex_armory_04_7,Ahem...
d_ex_armory_04_8,Care to fill me in?
d_ex_armory_04_9,"Oh, sorry."
d_ex_armory_04_10,"Someone donated a gun during the charity drive, and now Mast and Anchor don't know what to do with it."
d_ex_armory_04_11,"They took it to a gun shop, but they wouldn't accept it since it was the first time they said they'd seen anything like it."
d_ex_armory_04_12,"So we took it to a gun expert, but..."
d_ex_armory_04_13,"Hey look. Check out this steel wire, and the butt.
This is Missilis technology for sure."
d_ex_armory_04_14,"No way Missilis can make steel like this. This is Elysion, no doubt about it."
d_ex_armory_04_15,What do you know? How can you tell just by looking at it? Are you an expert?
d_ex_armory_04_16,"Look who's talking! You're supposed to be a mechanic, but you can't even recognize what type of gun this is!"
d_ex_armory_04_17,See? No one's saying anything now.
d_ex_armory_04_18,"If we could get access to a place with a variety of weapons, we might be able to compare it with them."
d_ex_armory_04_19,"That's easier said than done, however."
d_ex_armory_04_20,What are the chances it was hand-made?
d_ex_armory_04_21,That's impossible.
d_ex_armory_04_22,Anyone who made their own weapons would be deported by the Central Government for breaking the law.
d_ex_armory_04_23,"Not only that, where would they get the parts?"
d_ex_armory_04_24,What are you doing? Who said you could come in?
d_ex_armory_04_25,Charming as always.
d_ex_armory_04_26,"Oh, Eunhwa. Good thing you're here."
d_ex_armory_04_27,Take a look at this gun.
d_ex_armory_04_28,"It's a gun that was donated to Helm, but we can't make heads or tails of it. We're just trying to sell the darn thing."
d_ex_armory_04_29,We figured you might have an idea as to what it is.
d_ex_armory_04_30,Doubt it. What would she know? All she knows is how to shoot guns.
d_ex_armory_04_31,...
d_ex_armory_04_32,Where did you get this?
d_ex_armory_04_33,It was a donation.
d_ex_armory_04_34,From who?
d_ex_armory_04_35,I can't say.
d_ex_armory_04_36,"Well, next time you see them, you should bow down and thank them."
d_ex_armory_04_37,This is a model gun made by Alpha Tech.
d_ex_armory_04_38,... Did you say 'model gun'?
d_ex_armory_04_39,So it's just a toy? Then how come it's so intricate?
d_ex_armory_04_40,This is no 'toy'. It's a one-of-a-kind piece. Only 20 of them were made.
d_ex_armory_04_41,Don't take it for granted just because it's a model gun. The mechanism it uses was several years ahead of its time.
d_ex_armory_04_42,It's for that very reason that it's so highly sought after by collectors.
d_ex_armory_04_43,How much does it go for?
d_ex_armory_04_44,I'd say about 300 million Credits.
d_ex_armory_04_45,... Did you just say...
d_ex_armory_04_46,300 million?!
d_ex_armory_04_47,... Are you sure?
d_ex_armory_04_48,"Maybe even more than that, considering that it's in almost pristine condition."
d_ex_armory_04_49,I've got half a mind to buy it myself.
d_ex_armory_04_50,...
d_ex_armory_04_51,I know plenty of people who would be interested in this. You'll make more if you put this up for auction.
d_ex_armory_04_52,I'll introduce you to them.
d_ex_armory_04_53,"No, it's okay."
d_ex_armory_04_54,...?
d_ex_armory_04_55,I need to return it. We can't accept something like this.
d_ex_armory_04_56,"Wait, why not? It was a donation!"
d_ex_armory_04_57,"Exactly. If we sell that thing, we'll be set for at least..."
d_ex_armory_04_58,We don't need that much money.
d_ex_armory_04_59,I'm not so sure your fellow buccaneers agree with you there.
d_ex_armory_04_60,We have to maintain our dignity.
d_ex_armory_04_61,...
d_ex_armory_04_62,Do whatever you want. See if I care.
d_ex_armory_04_63,Helm.
d_ex_armory_04_64,"It's good to have pride, but you need to know when to be flexible."
d_ex_armory_04_65,Or others might suffer as a consequence.
d_ex_armory_04_66,"I realize that. Still, we can't do this."
d_ex_armory_04_67,If you say so...
d_ex_armory_04_68,"I'm going. Thank you, everyone."
d_ex_armory_04_69,Helm leaves.
d_ex_armory_04_70,What are you standing around for? Beat it.
d_ex_armory_04_71,"Okay, okay."
d_ex_armory_04_72,I never thought you'd be interested in anything we brought you.
d_ex_armory_04_73,"For morons like you, I'm sure it just looked like any other toy."
d_ex_armory_04_74,"Speaking of toys, what are you into? Dress-up dolls? Tea sets?"
d_ex_armory_04_75,"Oooh, you just reminded me! Last time I was at the toy section..."
d_ex_armory_04_76,...
d_ex_armory_04_77,What about an Ark Girl Doll?
d_ex_armory_04_78,What about an EZ bake oven?
d_ex_armory_04_79,I said get out.
d_ex_armory_04_80,... We got kicked out.

d_ex_gym_04_1,"Come on, one more!"
d_ex_gym_04_2,Gahhhh...!
d_ex_gym_04_3,That's it! Gimme one more!
d_ex_gym_04_4,I can't...!
d_ex_gym_04_5,The barbell I am holding is too heavy!
d_ex_gym_04_6,It feels as if it is going to crush me.
d_ex_gym_04_7,*Grab*
d_ex_gym_04_8,"Come on now, string bean! You're telling me you can't lift that?"
d_ex_gym_04_9,And you call yourself my sidekick? For shame!
d_ex_gym_04_10,Laplace holds up the barbell I am holding.
d_ex_gym_04_11,*Whoosh*
d_ex_gym_04_12,*Crashhh*
d_ex_gym_04_13,"Laplace hurls the barbell through the nearest window, shattering the glass."
d_ex_gym_04_14,...
d_ex_gym_04_15,Don't be too hard on yourself. You're just not ready for barbells yet.
d_ex_gym_04_16,"Besides, this kind of exercise is useless. What you need is my patented Get Ripped Like a Superhero program!"
d_ex_gym_04_17,...
d_ex_gym_04_18,Laplace.
d_ex_gym_04_19,"You wanna join too, Rumani? Follow me, then!"
d_ex_gym_04_20,You shouldn't interfere when someone is holding up a barbell.
d_ex_gym_04_21,"I shouldn't even have to mention this, but you shouldn't throw barbells either."
d_ex_gym_04_22,It's okay. I calculated it all out beforehand.
d_ex_gym_04_23,...
d_ex_gym_04_24,"Laplace, when you were holding up that barbell, I noticed you seem to lean to one side."
d_ex_gym_04_25,That means the weight is unevenly balanced and you're not properly simulating both sides of your body.
d_ex_gym_04_26,...
d_ex_gym_04_27,"You don't know the first thing about training, do you?"
d_ex_gym_04_28,Please! I live and breathe training!
d_ex_gym_04_29,Is that so?
d_ex_gym_04_30,Then should we start?
d_ex_gym_04_31,You've gone and made her upset.
d_ex_gym_04_32,That's a wonderful idea! I just hope your jaw doesn't hurt when it hits the floor.
d_ex_gym_04_33,A moment later.
d_ex_gym_04_34,"Don't straighten your legs until the very end, otherwise, you'll damage your knees."
d_ex_gym_04_35,Any hero worth their salt can endure it!
d_ex_gym_04_36,"The most dangerous thing is using your strength without thinking. Otherwise, you're just asking to get injured."
d_ex_gym_04_37,"Hm, hmmmm...!"
d_ex_gym_04_38,... Okay. Next.
d_ex_gym_04_39,A moment later.
d_ex_gym_04_40,You have to lift it up higher. Your elbows need to be completely straight.
d_ex_gym_04_41,Urgh... my arms won't go that high...!
d_ex_gym_04_42,Why not? They should.
d_ex_gym_04_43,... Are you sure you know what you're doing?

d_ex_gym_04_50,It's not broken. Your muscles just aren't used to that movement.
d_ex_gym_04_51,Come here. Let me look at it.
d_ex_gym_04_52,A moment later.
d_ex_gym_04_53,I'm sorry.
d_ex_gym_04_54,I apologize for looking down on training.
d_ex_gym_04_55,"It's fine. You know now, and that's what's important."
d_ex_gym_04_56,"From now on, I'll train as hard as I can."
d_ex_gym_04_57,You can help me if there's anything I don't know.
d_ex_gym_04_58,But...
d_ex_gym_04_59,"isn't your body 9th generation? Older, even?"
d_ex_gym_04_60,That's right.
d_ex_gym_04_61,Then why are you even training?
d_ex_gym_04_62,Why shouldn't I?
d_ex_gym_04_63,... Muscles only grow in the body before the ninth generation.
d_ex_gym_04_64,...?

d_ex_modernbar_04_title,Live Bar
d_ex_modernbar_04_1,I drop by the bar to quench my thirst.
d_ex_modernbar_04_2,Hey there.
d_ex_modernbar_04_3,What'll you have?
d_ex_modernbar_04_4,Are you alone?
d_ex_modernbar_04_5,In a way. I'm the only one drinking.
d_ex_modernbar_04_6,The others are singing.
d_ex_modernbar_04_7,Who?
d_ex_modernbar_04_8,There. Up on the stage.
d_ex_modernbar_04_9,"Looking at where Dolla is pointing, I spot Noise and Laplace."
d_ex_modernbar_04_10,Now that's an odd combination.
d_ex_modernbar_04_11,They've been trying for a while now to compose a heroic theme song.
d_ex_modernbar_04_12,"They were making a real racket a second ago, but they've quietened down a bit."
d_ex_modernbar_04_13,I think at this point there should be something like bambambabam!
d_ex_modernbar_04_14,"Babababam!! Yeah, that's great. Then the word ""hero"" with some reverb!"
d_ex_modernbar_04_15,Bambambabam! Babababam!! Herooooo!!
d_ex_modernbar_04_16,I spoke too soon.
d_ex_modernbar_04_17,"No, no, no. That's no good. You've been asking for something grand and powerful. It's all so one-note."
d_ex_modernbar_04_18,Great songwriting comes from a deft balancing of strength and vulnerability.
d_ex_modernbar_04_19,A hero has to be strong! There should be no weakness!
d_ex_modernbar_04_20,We're making a song! You asked me to make a song!
d_ex_modernbar_04_21,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_22,Then how about Bambambabam! Babababam! Herooooo!
d_ex_modernbar_04_23,That's no different than what you said a few minutes ago!
d_ex_modernbar_04_24,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_25,All I wanted was to drink in peace after the tough negotiations I had today.
d_ex_modernbar_04_26,"Instead, I get this."
d_ex_modernbar_04_27,"I hate to ask,"
d_ex_modernbar_04_28,but is there any way you can make them be quiet?
d_ex_modernbar_04_29,"If they don't shut their mouths soon, I'll shut it for them."
d_ex_modernbar_04_30,I'll have a try.
d_ex_modernbar_04_31,I approach Noise and Laplace.
d_ex_modernbar_04_32,How about Bboobboobboom! Boobbooroobooboom! Bbeebboribbeebba!
d_ex_modernbar_04_33,Are you even trying to make a song at this point?
d_ex_modernbar_04_34,Laplace. Noise.
d_ex_modernbar_04_35,"Hey there, Birdie!"
d_ex_modernbar_04_36,Producer?
d_ex_modernbar_04_37,Could you keep it dow...
d_ex_modernbar_04_38,Birdie! It's good that you're here. You can help me out with this song I'm writing.
d_ex_modernbar_04_39,Yeah! I'm sure you'll be able to help us out.
d_ex_modernbar_04_40,You've got an ear for music.
d_ex_modernbar_04_41,"Right, you've got some talent in this area."
d_ex_modernbar_04_42,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_43,"It's embarrassing to admit, but I don't have any idea what I'm doing! I think I may have finally found something that a hero can't do."
d_ex_modernbar_04_44,Can you imagine how relieved I am to see you?!
d_ex_modernbar_04_45,"Can you look at this section? No matter what we do with it, it always feels like we're coming in too strong..."
d_ex_modernbar_04_46,"All right, let's just get this over with."
d_ex_modernbar_04_47,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_48,I sense someone glaring in my direction.
d_ex_modernbar_04_49,"Listen you guys, now's not the right time to be doing this."
d_ex_modernbar_04_50,??
d_ex_modernbar_04_51,??
d_ex_modernbar_04_52,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_53,"Ah, right!"
d_ex_modernbar_04_54,We totally forgot about the main idea behind the song! Everyone knows that's the first step of songwriting.
d_ex_modernbar_04_55,What a rookie mistake on my part.
d_ex_modernbar_04_56,I've still got a long way to go...
d_ex_modernbar_04_57,"I knew you'd figure it out, Producer."
d_ex_modernbar_04_58,"I'm not exactly sure what just happened, but you're the best, Birdie!"
d_ex_modernbar_04_59,Yes! Amazing!
d_ex_modernbar_04_60,"No, what I mean is..."
d_ex_modernbar_04_61,"Come on, let's keep going! We're in the zone!"
d_ex_modernbar_04_62,Right! We can't stop now!
d_ex_modernbar_04_63,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_64,Booboom Beebop! Booboom Beebop! Like that?
d_ex_modernbar_04_65,Perfect flow!
d_ex_modernbar_04_66,Then after connecting it with Bbaalalaal...
d_ex_modernbar_04_67,"Save it for another time, you two."
d_ex_modernbar_04_68,??
d_ex_modernbar_04_69,??
d_ex_modernbar_04_70,"Would you keep it down? You're so loud, people across town can probably hear you."
d_ex_modernbar_04_71,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_72,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_73,Oh my gosh... I must be losing my mind doing this here of all places.
d_ex_modernbar_04_74,I was so focused that I didn't even realize it.
d_ex_modernbar_04_75,"We can work on the rest in the theater. Laplace, follow me."
d_ex_modernbar_04_76,Okay.
d_ex_modernbar_04_77,Sorry about that.
d_ex_modernbar_04_78,Sorry. I'll buy you a drink next time.
d_ex_modernbar_04_79,"As Noise and Laplace leave, a wonderful silence falls over the bar."
d_ex_modernbar_04_80,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_81,...
d_ex_modernbar_04_82,Come here and sit beside me.
d_ex_modernbar_04_83,I sit beside Dolla.
d_ex_modernbar_04_84,"*Gulp, gulp*"
d_ex_modernbar_04_85,Drinks are on me.
d_ex_modernbar_04_86,Thanks.
d_ex_command_04_title,Soporific Coffee?
d_ex_command_04_1,"Hello, No. 7. I'm here for your regular checkup."
d_ex_command_04_2,Or should I say experiment?
d_ex_command_04_3,Whatever. I'm exhausted. Just take this medicine so we can get this over with.
d_ex_command_04_4,Have you been overworked lately?
d_ex_command_04_5,Those dark circles under your eyes...
d_ex_command_04_6,It doesn't matter.
d_ex_command_04_7,It's always been like this.
d_ex_command_04_8,"Oh, these?"
d_ex_command_04_9,I've gotten used to them by now.
d_ex_command_04_10,"Syuen gave us a week's worth of work yesterday, and they're due by the end of today."
d_ex_command_04_11,"*Yawn* Thanks to her, I haven't gotten a wink of sleep."
d_ex_command_04_12,You look like you could use some coffee.
d_ex_command_04_13,"Thanks, that'd be nice."
d_ex_command_04_14,Coffee is a lifesaver for anyone working overtime
d_ex_command_04_15,Soon after.
d_ex_command_04_16,Coffee. Here.
d_ex_command_04_17,"Hey, Burly Bear! It's been a while."
d_ex_command_04_18,What's Neve doing deliveries for?
d_ex_command_04_19,"I heard there was some kind of wonder drug in the Ark that helps you sleep,"
d_ex_command_04_20,so I came here looking for it.
d_ex_command_04_21,"Turns out, I ran into someone delivering the very thing I was looking for!"
d_ex_command_04_22,Wonder drug... are you talking about coffee?
d_ex_command_04_23,That's the stuff!
d_ex_command_04_24,I think you may be barking up the wrong tree.
d_ex_command_04_25,"Coffee is loaded with caffeine. It's designed to keep you awake, not help you fall asleep."
d_ex_command_04_26,?
d_ex_command_04_27,No. Not Cream Coffee.
d_ex_command_04_28,Drink it. Sleep heavy.
d_ex_command_04_29,Here. Look.
d_ex_command_04_30,...
d_ex_command_04_31,I'd like to see this.
d_ex_command_04_32,"If this works, we'll be spitting in the face of years of scientific evidence."
d_ex_command_04_33,One gulp. Important.
d_ex_command_04_34,Frima downs the entire cup of coffee in one big sip.
d_ex_command_04_35,*Gulp*
d_ex_command_04_36,3...
d_ex_command_04_37,2...
d_ex_command_04_38,Frima quickly puts on her eyeshade.
d_ex_command_04_39,1...
d_ex_command_04_40,Zzzzz...
d_ex_command_04_41,... She's asleep.
d_ex_command_04_42,...!!
d_ex_command_04_43,Huh?
d_ex_command_04_44,This is most intriguing.
d_ex_command_04_45,"To be fair, outliers like Frima shouldn't be factored into the equation."
d_ex_command_04_46,She always falls asleep the moment her head rests on some kind of surface.
d_ex_command_04_47,Hmm...
d_ex_command_04_48,How about I test it out?
d_ex_command_04_49,You're something of an outlier yourself.
d_ex_command_04_50,"I know, I sleep an awful lot."
d_ex_command_04_51,"However, I just had a great cat nap in the elevator on the way here."
d_ex_command_04_52,"If I drink this and it doesn't put me to sleep, that'll prove it's not all it's cracked up to be."
d_ex_command_04_53,Very well.
d_ex_command_04_54,"I'm a busy woman, so let's get this show on the road."
d_ex_command_04_55,You got it!
d_ex_command_04_56,Neve downs the entire cup of Cream Coffee.
d_ex_command_04_57,*Glug*
d_ex_command_04_58,3...
d_ex_command_04_59,2...
d_ex_command_04_60,Whoa... this stuff... is...
d_ex_command_04_61,1...
d_ex_command_04_62,Zzzzz...
d_ex_command_04_63,...!!
d_ex_command_04_64,What on earth?
d_ex_command_04_65,Have they laced this with tranquilizers or something?
d_ex_command_04_66,Cafe Sweety's recipe never changes.
d_ex_command_04_67,This stuff usually comes from a vending machine.
d_ex_command_04_68,...
d_ex_command_04_69,Then I can't find a rational explanation for this phenomenon.
d_ex_command_04_70,Should I ask HQ to inspect the ingredients?
d_ex_command_04_71,"No, we're busy enough as is..."
d_ex_command_04_72,You and I can taste-test it.
d_ex_command_04_73,You sure you'll be okay?
d_ex_command_04_74,When did I ever agree to this?
d_ex_command_04_75,"If this coffee really does contain sleep inducers, then it'll negatively affect my work performance, but..."
d_ex_command_04_76,"You of all people should know, No. 7. At M.M.R., our curiosity is insatiable."
d_ex_command_04_77,"What do you want, a written contract?"
d_ex_command_04_78,"Come on, consider it a favor to a researcher who's hungry for the truth."
d_ex_command_04_79,Fine.
d_ex_command_04_80,"I hold a cup of the cream coffee, glancing at it with a look of concern."
d_ex_command_04_81,I'll go first.
d_ex_command_04_82,Ether downs her cup in one go.
d_ex_command_04_83,I follow suit.
d_ex_command_04_84,*Glug*
d_ex_command_04_85,3...
d_ex_command_04_86,2...
d_ex_command_04_87,1...
d_ex_command_04_88,...
d_ex_command_04_89,I feel like I'm burning up.
d_ex_command_04_90,My heart is racing. My body feels amped up.
d_ex_command_04_91,This stuff is clearly loaded with caffeine.
d_ex_command_04_92,"What about you, No. 7?"
d_ex_command_04_93,...
d_ex_command_04_94,I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.
d_ex_workshop_04_title,Legendary Snowboard
d_ex_workshop_04_01,"Hey, welcome to Mighty Tools! You name it, we can do it!"
d_ex_workshop_04_02,Hi. Is Liter here?
d_ex_workshop_04_03,I'm afraid she stepped out to inspect some new machinery that just arrived.
d_ex_workshop_04_04,Can I put in an order then?
d_ex_workshop_04_05,Sure!
d_ex_workshop_04_06,Then...
d_ex_workshop_04_07,I want you to make a board for Anne.
d_ex_workshop_04_08,Like from the old days.
d_ex_workshop_04_09,Hey there.
d_ex_workshop_04_10,Epinel told me that there used to be boards that you could ride on snow with.
d_ex_workshop_04_11,"They sounded super cool to me,"
d_ex_workshop_04_12,"and Epinel said she could take me to a workshop that could make anything... so, here we are."
d_ex_workshop_04_13,!!
d_ex_workshop_04_14,You bet we can!
d_ex_workshop_04_15,My only question is...
d_ex_workshop_04_16,when would you ever have to ride a board on top of the snow?
d_ex_workshop_04_17,Does snow even pile up that high?
d_ex_workshop_04_18,So...
d_ex_workshop_04_19,you're saying you can't do it?
d_ex_workshop_04_20,Hmmmm...
d_ex_workshop_04_21,"To be honest, it's pretty advanced for a one-man job."
d_ex_workshop_04_22,"But if someone more familiar with the concept could give me some pointers,"
d_ex_workshop_04_23,"I'd be able to churn it out with no problem, no matter how unfamiliar it is to me."
d_ex_workshop_04_24,I see what you mean.
d_ex_workshop_04_25,"Wait a moment, I've got just the person."
d_ex_workshop_04_26,... Soon after.
d_ex_workshop_04_27,Teacher?
d_ex_workshop_04_28,Are you the one who will be giving orders to Centi?
d_ex_workshop_04_29,"What do you mean ""orders""?"
d_ex_workshop_04_30,I don't know what's going on. Epinel just said it was something urgent.
d_ex_workshop_04_31,Boss!
d_ex_workshop_04_32,Do you happen to know anything of some kind of board that you can use to ride across the snow?
d_ex_workshop_04_33,I've heard about it.
d_ex_workshop_04_34,Perfect!
d_ex_workshop_04_35,Sounds like we're about to have two satisfied customers.
d_ex_workshop_04_36,"All right then, what do I have to do to get started?"
d_ex_workshop_04_37,I've only heard about it. I don't have the slightest clue on how to make one.
d_ex_workshop_04_38,At least you've heard about it. That's more than I can do for myself.
d_ex_workshop_04_39,...
d_ex_workshop_04_40,So what's the first step?
d_ex_workshop_04_41,...
d_ex_workshop_04_42,How about we start with the shape? The board should be long.
d_ex_workshop_04_43,... What she said.
d_ex_workshop_04_44,Sure thing.
d_ex_workshop_04_45,*Wiiiing*
d_ex_workshop_04_46,"Centi cuts out several layers of planks, stacks them on top of each other,"
d_ex_workshop_04_47,then finishes off by using a cutter to round off the ends.
d_ex_workshop_04_48,"All right Boss, what's next?"
d_ex_workshop_04_49,"I'm not 100% sure,"
d_ex_workshop_04_50,"but if it's a board, then surely it needs wheels, doesn't it?"
d_ex_workshop_04_51,"And since it's meant to be used in winter, how about we add some snowflake decals?"
d_ex_workshop_04_52,Add wheels and then some snowflake decals.
d_ex_workshop_04_53,I'm on it!
d_ex_workshop_04_54,*Tang! Tang! Tang*
d_ex_workshop_04_55,Centi crafts some wheels and attaches them to the board.
d_ex_workshop_04_56,She then proceeds to paste several snowflake decals on the deck.
d_ex_workshop_04_57,It's really starting to come together.
d_ex_workshop_04_58,...
d_ex_workshop_04_59,"It's meant to be ridden on top of the snow, but... it doesn't really have any distinguishing features."
d_ex_workshop_04_60,What else do you think we can do?
d_ex_workshop_04_61,I don't think we should go overboard with it.
d_ex_workshop_04_62,"There are a few things, but a board should be lightweight..."
d_ex_workshop_04_63,"C'mon Boss, don't be so indecisive."
d_ex_workshop_04_64,"Besides, no one here has seen one of these things before."
d_ex_workshop_04_65,It's not like anyone is going to call you out for inaccuracy.
d_ex_workshop_04_66,Let's add a sensor that detects sinkholes under the snow.
d_ex_workshop_04_67,Let's add a sensor that detects avalanches.
d_ex_workshop_04_68,"Oh, right!"
d_ex_workshop_04_69,I hadn't even considered that.
d_ex_workshop_04_70,"It's wonderful that you always keep the safety of your Nikkes in mind, Commander."
d_ex_workshop_04_71,*Kssssss*
d_ex_workshop_04_72,Now what?
d_ex_workshop_04_73,"Anne, is there anything else you want to add?"
d_ex_workshop_04_74,Um... well...
d_ex_workshop_04_75,Could we add somewhere where I could store my notebook?
d_ex_workshop_04_76,I'm worried that I might lose it while riding.
d_ex_workshop_04_77,How about adding storage space for all sorts of things?
d_ex_workshop_04_78,...!!
d_ex_workshop_04_79,"Now that I think about it, if you want to ride this on top of the snow, you'll need to head up to the surface."
d_ex_workshop_04_80,"You'll have to bring firearms and supplies,"
d_ex_workshop_04_81,so it makes sense for us to add a bit of storage space.
d_ex_workshop_04_82,*Tang! Tang! Tang*
d_ex_workshop_04_83,*Kssssss*
d_ex_workshop_04_84,"Phew... all right, what's next?"
d_ex_workshop_04_85,If you ask me...
d_ex_workshop_04_86,Centi tips her workman's cap.
d_ex_workshop_04_87,I think we've really outdone ourselves!
d_ex_workshop_04_88,"Good job, Centi."
d_ex_workshop_04_89,You've done Mighty Tools proud.
d_ex_workshop_04_90,"I appreciate it,"
d_ex_workshop_04_91,but I should be thanking the three of you for bringing me such a cool order.
d_ex_workshop_04_92,...
d_ex_workshop_04_93,How about we all head outside and take in the sunset?
d_ex_workshop_04_94,The weather is perfect.
d_ex_workshop_04_95,"Oh, let's hurry before the sun gets away from us!"
d_ex_workshop_04_96,Everyone left the workshop in high spirits.
d_ex_workshop_04_97,... Soon after.
d_ex_workshop_04_98,Finally... that inspection took ages.
d_ex_workshop_04_99,I just hope Centi didn't run the place into the ground.
d_ex_workshop_04_100,Huh? What on earth is this thing?
d_ex_workshop_04_101,Wait...
d_ex_workshop_04_102,These wheels were supposed to be sent to the Central Government tomorrow.
d_ex_workshop_04_103,And these snowflake decals were meant for the Talentum Mall.
d_ex_workshop_04_104,...
d_ex_workshop_04_105,...
d_ex_workshop_04_106,What is this monstrosity?!
d_ex_workshop_04_107,Ceeenntttiiiii!!!
d_ex_elevator_04_title,Neve's Moving Castle
d_ex_elevator_04_1,*Yawn*
d_ex_elevator_04_2,"I know I say this every time, but it's such a long trek here."
d_ex_elevator_04_3,I nearly fell asleep several times along the way. Or was it that I already fell asleep several times?
d_ex_elevator_04_4,"Either way, all I know is that I'm tired now..."
d_ex_elevator_04_5,Thanks for making the trip.
d_ex_elevator_04_6,Try and last until we get to the Outpost.
d_ex_elevator_04_7,No problem.
d_ex_elevator_04_8,"I get the best sleep when I stay here, so it's all worth it."
d_ex_elevator_04_9,What's so great about it?
d_ex_elevator_04_10,Well... to be honest...
d_ex_elevator_04_11,"It's not exactly this place that's so comfy, it's who I'm with..."
d_ex_elevator_04_12,And who would that be?
d_ex_elevator_04_13,Well... you know...
d_ex_elevator_04_14,"You're just so soft and cuddly, just like a polar bear."
d_ex_elevator_04_15,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_16,"As soon as the elevator door opens,
Neve lays down and falls asleep."
d_ex_elevator_04_17,I'm at a loss as to what to do.
d_ex_elevator_04_18,Press the button for the Outpost.
d_ex_elevator_04_19,...
d_ex_elevator_04_20,The elevator starts to go down.
d_ex_elevator_04_21,Soon after.
d_ex_elevator_04_22,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_23,"We've arrived at the Outpost, but what about Neve?"
d_ex_elevator_04_24,Wake Neve up.
d_ex_elevator_04_25,Wait until Neve wakes up.
d_ex_elevator_04_26,*Poke*
d_ex_elevator_04_27,Zzzz...
d_ex_elevator_04_28,Zzzzzzzzz...
d_ex_elevator_04_29,No reaction whatsoever. I might as well be poking a corpse.
d_ex_elevator_04_30,Zzzz...
d_ex_elevator_04_31,Zzzzzzzzz...
d_ex_elevator_04_32,She's out like a light.
d_ex_elevator_04_33,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_34,What is this?
d_ex_elevator_04_35,Since when did the elevator become a squat for random riff-raff?
d_ex_elevator_04_36,"Come Eunhwa, don't be like that."
d_ex_elevator_04_37,She must be exhausted.
d_ex_elevator_04_38,Sorry.
d_ex_elevator_04_39,We'll be leaving soon.
d_ex_elevator_04_40,... Tsk.
d_ex_elevator_04_41,Can't you even take proper care of your own Nikkes?
d_ex_elevator_04_42,... The elevator starts to go up.
d_ex_elevator_04_43,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_44,She better be gone when I get back.
d_ex_elevator_04_45,"You really ought to take her home, Commander."
d_ex_elevator_04_46,... The door closes again.
d_ex_elevator_04_47,Press the button for the Outpost.
d_ex_elevator_04_48,... The elevator starts to go down again.
d_ex_elevator_04_49,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_50,Hellooo! My lovely Lupins!
d_ex_elevator_04_51,"The year is nearly over, so I've got something special for you all today."
d_ex_elevator_04_52,"I'll be doing a special seasonal spooktacular covering seven scary stories in the Outpost! First, we have the tale of the haunted elevator..."
d_ex_elevator_04_53,EEEEEEKKK!? A dead body!
d_ex_elevator_04_54,Relax. She's not dead... not yet at least.
d_ex_elevator_04_55,"Bu-but if she's sleeping in the elevator,
she must be in a sorry state."
d_ex_elevator_04_56,Shouldn't we notify the Repair Center?
d_ex_elevator_04_57,Or contact the police and tell them there's been a murder!
d_ex_elevator_04_58,*Boom*
d_ex_elevator_04_59,Neve awakens and slams her fist on the floor.
d_ex_elevator_04_60,*Yawn*
d_ex_elevator_04_61,Who's making all that noise?
d_ex_elevator_04_62,I thought I made it clear that I don't like being woken up.
d_ex_elevator_04_63,...
d_ex_elevator_04_64,Haven't you heard of that old saying?
d_ex_elevator_04_65,"Don't wake up a sleeping bear, because if you do..."
d_ex_elevator_04_66,It'll eat you for dinner!
d_ex_elevator_04_67,...
d_ex_elevator_04_68,*Gulp*
d_ex_elevator_04_69,Wait a minute!
d_ex_elevator_04_70,I just thought of a perfect idea for this new spooky series.
d_ex_elevator_04_71,"Something new and exciting. After all, I've covered winter fashions and shopping a million times already."
d_ex_elevator_04_72,"Anyway, stay tuned for something really special!"
d_ex_elevator_04_73,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_74,Rupee dashes out of the open elevator doors.
d_ex_elevator_04_75,... What should I do now?
d_ex_elevator_04_76,Zone out.
d_ex_elevator_04_77,Watch Neve sleep.
d_ex_elevator_04_78,Mmm...
d_ex_elevator_04_79,So comfy...
d_ex_elevator_04_80,I wanna take you to the base...
d_ex_elevator_04_81,Zzzzzzzzz...
d_ex_elevator_04_82,"While Neve has her arms wrapped around me, I rack my brains."
d_ex_elevator_04_83,Maybe I'll come up with something.
d_ex_elevator_04_84,... Nothing.
d_ex_elevator_04_85,Soon after.
d_ex_elevator_04_86,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_04_87,...
d_ex_elevator_04_88,...
d_ex_elevator_04_89,"Aww, aren't they adorable?"
d_ex_elevator_04_90,They're both sound asleep.
d_ex_elevator_04_91,Don't these deadbeats have any discipline?
d_ex_elevator_04_92,What are you doing to do?
d_ex_elevator_04_93,...
d_ex_elevator_04_94,"Without a word, Eunhwa picks up Neve."
d_ex_elevator_04_95,You take the other one. Follow me.
d_ex_elevator_04_96,"Hehe, you're so kind."
d_ex_elevator_04_97,Shut it. I'm just getting rid of something that's in my way.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_title,It's Just Business
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_1,There is a bazaar opening in front of the Goddess of Victory statue.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_2,A Yuletide flea market... this is quite the shindig.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_3,I've been seeing ads for this all over the Ark.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_4,"It's a good thing we came, right Anne?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_5,Yeah!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_6,Can I really choose whatever I want?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_7,Of course you can. It's on me.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_8,Really?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_9,Then... Can I buy a bear stuffed toy?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_10,You sure can.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_11,!!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_12,How about this fairy tale book?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_13,That too.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_14,!!!!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_15,Th-then...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_16,What about this model ice castle?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_17,Consider it done.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_18,"Wait a minute, 7,500,000 credits?! Who considers these flea market prices?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_19,So I can't have it?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_20,Well...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_21,I suppose it's okay to splurge a bit. Go ahead.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_22,"Woohoo! You're the best, Rupee!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_23,"You're not so bad yourself, kiddo."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_24,Anne and Rupee run to and fro across the entirety of the bazaar.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_25,Is it really okay buying all of this stuff?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_26,I'm not sure if this is good for her.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_27,Don't you get it?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_28,"If she keeps accumulating happy memories like she is today,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_29,some of them might stick.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_30,"There's nothing I love more than shopping,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_31,so I wanted Anne to experience that joy as well.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_32,"The more pleasant memories we give her,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_33,the happier she'll be.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_34,If you say so.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_35,"Besides,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_36,"someone as adorable as her,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_37,deserves to have everything she wants in this world.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_38,"Under my tutelage, she'll become a seasoned shopaholic in no time."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_39,You spend enough money as is. I shudder to think of having two of you running around.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_40,Eep!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_41,"Um... Sorry, Sweetie, but something just came up. Anne and I really have to get going."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_42,"Beating a swift retreat, I see."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_43,Eek! Don't hurt me!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_44,Rupee cowers behind me.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_45,Are you shopping for anything specific?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_46,"No, just hunting down a certain someone who failed to show up to the company meeting."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_47,I-I just wanted to buy some gifts for Anne.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_48,I assume that doll she's holding is one of them?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_49,"Oh, this? Yeah!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_50,Let me see that.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_51,Yan yanks the bear doll from Anne's hands.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_52,This was recalled last month. The stuffing was found to contain harmful particles.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_53,Just because Anne is a Nikke doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_54,"Yes, Miss..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_55,Take this one instead.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_56,This is the finest out of our mid-range products.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_57,"It also uses eco-friendly materials, so it won't cause any harm to infants who chew on it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_58,Look at the size of it! It's so cute!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_59,Thank you!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_60,So well-mannered.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_61,"Don't let Rupee rub off on you too much, okay?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_62,Hey...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_63,What about the fairy tale book? Don't you like it?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_64,"It's got such a lovely title, and the pictures are super pretty!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_65,It's been a best seller for the last 6 weeks.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_66,Did you see what age group it's meant for?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_67,Let me see...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_68,... Adults.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_69,"In other words, not meant for children."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_70,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_71,My recommendation is this. A book about the happiest butterfly in the world.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_72,"It's a little old, but it's been the best seller for 12 weeks in a row for children's books."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_73,How do you know about all of this?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_74,These things are something any merchant worth their salt should keep abreast of.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_75,"Honestly, I don't know how you've made it as far as you have."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_76,"How about this model, then?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_77,Just look at the detail. They captured everything perfectly.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_78,You can practically feel yourself wandering inside the icy castle yourself.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_79,"And where, may I ask, do you intend to keep this?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_80,Well...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_81,Rupee stares at me in desperation.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_82,There's no space for it in the dorm.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_83,Sigh...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_84,So we can't buy the castle?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_85,Wait. I'll choose something else.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_86,Let me see...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_87,Here.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_88,Yan opens up a box that is standing beside the castle.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_89,What is this?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_90,It's another castle that comes for free with the one you already purchased.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_91,"It's only half the size, but looks exactly the same. The parts are all separate, so you'll have to assemble them yourself."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_92,The three of you can assemble it together.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_93,Doesn't that sound like fun?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_94,All three of us?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_95,When can we start?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_96,Once you get back to the dorm.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_97,All right!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_98,"Anne stares at the pieces, her eyes filled with excitement."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_99,"If that's everything, let's go cash out."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_100,I've got this one.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_101,"You chose all the presents, so the least I can do is pay for them."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_102,"I know that. You didn't actually think I was going to pay for it, did you?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_103,"Besides this, there's something else you need to pay for."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_104,Something else?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_105,But I've already bought everything Anne wants...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_106,You of all people should know that my time is valuable.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_107,...?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_108,I had to schlep all the way over here to find you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_109,Do you realize how much time I've wasted on you?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_110,Uh oh. Here it comes...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_111,I have plenty of clients who'd pay a fortune for the kind of advice I just gave you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_112,"Taking that into consideration, I'd say you owe me approximately..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_113,You had this all planned from the very beginning!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_114,This is a scam! I'm not paying you anything!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_115,Not even after I made Anne so happy?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_116,Th-that's...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_117,I thought you cared about her.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_118,"That's why I did what I could to help. Oh well, it seems you don't feel that way about her after all."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_119,No!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_120,That's not what I meant...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_121,"Woohoo! You're the best, Rupee!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_122,"You're not so bad yourself, kiddo."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_123,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_124,I'll pay.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_125,That's more like it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_126,I don't take payments in cash.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_127,"I'm planning on holding a New Year's sale event at the store,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_128,and I want you to advertise it on your channel. Sound good?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_129,Yes...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_130,Anne tugs inquisitively on my sleeve.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_131,What's going on with Rupee? Why is she acting all funny?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_132,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_133,She got taken for a ride.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_134,A ride...?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_135,"For the next few weeks, anyone tuning into Rupee's shopping network"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_04_136,"would be greeted by advertisements for Yan's Talentum Mall, front and center."
d_ex_cafe_04_title,A Peculiar Coffee Tasting
d_ex_cafe_04_1,A special coffee tasting is being held at the cafe.
d_ex_cafe_04_2,Such a unique coffee is wasted on these philistines. Nobody here knows how to appreciate good java.
d_ex_cafe_04_3,Sugar left already...
d_ex_cafe_04_4,Am I really going to have to wake up that sloth Frima?
d_ex_cafe_04_5,*Zing*
d_ex_cafe_04_6,"Oh boy, I can smell the coffee already."
d_ex_cafe_04_7,*Sniff sniff* So this is where you drink coffee?
d_ex_cafe_04_8,Let's drink!
d_ex_cafe_04_9,Are you by yourself? Where's Sugar and Frima?
d_ex_cafe_04_10,Sugar took off on her bike. She's hunting down someone who gave her a bad review.
d_ex_cafe_04_11,As for our oh-so-useless leader...
d_ex_cafe_04_12,Milk gestures towards the inside of the shop.
d_ex_cafe_04_13,She's sleeping at a time like this?
d_ex_cafe_04_14,What else do you expect?
d_ex_cafe_04_15,Did you come for our coffee tasting? What about your friends?
d_ex_cafe_04_16,"I heard about it and was interested, so I brought them along."
d_ex_cafe_04_17,"C'mon, when's the part where we drink the coffee?!"
d_ex_cafe_04_18,Any chance you could prepare a few different flavors for us?
d_ex_cafe_04_19,"If anyone else asked me that, I'd be showing them the door,"
d_ex_cafe_04_20,"but for you, I'll make an exception."
d_ex_cafe_04_21,Wait a moment.
d_ex_cafe_04_22,"A moment later, Milk lays the coffee cup in front of Anne and Jackal, her eyes filled with anticipation."
d_ex_cafe_04_23,This here is what we call Cafe Sweety's Yuletide Brew.
d_ex_cafe_04_24,The paper cups are decorated in various wintertime patterns.
d_ex_cafe_04_25,What's different about it?
d_ex_cafe_04_26,Please don't tell me the only difference is the cup.
d_ex_cafe_04_27,Can't you tell?
d_ex_cafe_04_28,Milk points to the colorful paper cup.
d_ex_cafe_04_29,... The cup? That's all?
d_ex_cafe_04_30,Duh!
d_ex_cafe_04_31,Of course the coffee is the same!
d_ex_cafe_04_32,Why change perfection?
d_ex_cafe_04_33,The slightest alteration to the recipe could destroy the delicate balance.
d_ex_cafe_04_34,"Of course, Milk Coffee is the best of the bunch."
d_ex_cafe_04_35,It smells wonderful.
d_ex_cafe_04_36,Let's see who can neck all these first!
d_ex_cafe_04_37,"Wait. If you're going to try them all, start with Cream Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_04_38,"Okay, here goes."
d_ex_cafe_04_39,*Sip*
d_ex_cafe_04_40,"*Glug, glug, glug*"
d_ex_cafe_04_41,"Upon sipping the Cream Coffee, Anne and Jackal's eyes both are widened."
d_ex_cafe_04_42,So smooth!
d_ex_cafe_04_43,Blech!
d_ex_cafe_04_44,What is this? It tastes like you melted down a candle.
d_ex_cafe_04_45,My thoughts exactly.
d_ex_cafe_04_46,Consider it a trial by fire.
d_ex_cafe_04_47,"Now, onto the star of the show. Cafe Sweety's one and only Milk Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_04_48,"The one we just had was already delicious, and you're saying this is even better? I can't wait."
d_ex_cafe_04_49,"I'm telling you, between the two, there's no comparison!"
d_ex_cafe_04_50,"Let's give it a try, then."
d_ex_cafe_04_51,"*Glug, glug, glug*"
d_ex_cafe_04_52,Very interesting. Quite savory.
d_ex_cafe_04_53,"You know your stuff. Such is the beauty of Milk Coffee, my friend."
d_ex_cafe_04_54,Blech!
d_ex_cafe_04_55,Why would you put milk in this? Disgusting.
d_ex_cafe_04_56,...?! You son of a...!!
d_ex_cafe_04_57,Wait!
d_ex_cafe_04_58,I am barely able to prevent Milk from unholstering her weapon.
d_ex_cafe_04_59,You haven't tried all of them yet. Let's continue.
d_ex_cafe_04_60,... Yes. Right.
d_ex_cafe_04_61,"I can forgive you for dumping on Milk Coffee,"
d_ex_cafe_04_62,"but saying it's worse than Sugar and Cream Coffee? That, I will not allow."
d_ex_cafe_04_63,"All right, last one. Sugar Coffee."
d_ex_cafe_04_64,"Just like Cream Coffee, this is bottom of the barrel dreck."
d_ex_cafe_04_65,Go ahead and rank them. Take your time.
d_ex_cafe_04_66,"Off in the distance, a motorcycle engine can be heard."
d_ex_cafe_04_67,Looks like Sugar is back.
d_ex_cafe_04_68,Let's tell her how nasty her coffee is!
d_ex_cafe_04_69,We went through them so quickly... I'm so sad there aren't more.
d_ex_cafe_04_70,The Sugar Coffee is...
d_ex_cafe_04_71,"*Glug, glug, glug*"
d_ex_cafe_04_72,Very sweet! It's quite good.
d_ex_cafe_04_73,I'm gonna hurl.
d_ex_cafe_04_74,This is the worst one yet. How is it even possible to make a drink this bad?
d_ex_cafe_04_75,You might not be so ignorant when it comes to coffee after all.
d_ex_cafe_04_76,"The Sugar Coffee is just reprehensible, am I right? I knew it!"
d_ex_cafe_04_77,"Patooey! Commander, you said you were going to treat me to something delicious."
d_ex_cafe_04_78,I take it this wasn't quite to your preference?
d_ex_cafe_04_79,Hehe. I found it to be delicious.
d_ex_cafe_04_80,Thank you for bringing me here.
d_ex_cafe_04_81,Maybe we should try another one?
d_ex_cafe_04_82,"The revving of the motorcycle engine becomes louder,"
d_ex_cafe_04_83,but it doesn't sound as if it's slowing down...
d_ex_cafe_04_84,*Crash*
d_ex_cafe_04_85,Gah!
d_ex_cafe_04_86,What's gotten into her?
d_ex_cafe_04_87,"Sugar's motorcycle, Black Typhoon, crashes through the cafe's front window."
d_ex_cafe_04_88,Teacher?!
d_ex_cafe_04_89,Is this some kind of joke?
d_ex_cafe_04_90,"If it is, I'm not laughing. I'll treat you to another coffee some other time."
d_ex_cafe_04_91,Hehe! Let's go!
d_ex_cafe_04_92,"Before everything descends into utter chaos, I grab Anne and Jackal's hands and run off."
d_ex_police_04_title,Livestreamer in Crisis
d_ex_police_04_1,"Sweetie, it's you!"
d_ex_police_04_2,You're free to go.
d_ex_police_04_3,I'm sorry to have troubled you.
d_ex_police_04_4,They let me go with no problem before.
d_ex_police_04_5,"But this time, they said someone had to come bail me out."
d_ex_police_04_6,This isn't your first time here?
d_ex_police_04_7,"The third time, to be exact."
d_ex_police_04_8,"Honestly, what sense does it make to report someone for a ""noise disturbance"" in the middle of a shopping mall?"
d_ex_police_04_9,They blare the music there way louder than I talk... hey!
d_ex_police_04_10,"Almost as if materializing out of thin air, a pair of hands come forward and push Rupee aside."
d_ex_police_04_11,Right? It doesn't make any sense.
d_ex_police_04_12,"Thanks for busting me outta here, Babe."
d_ex_police_04_13,"If you hadn't shown up, I'd have been stuck in this hole for the next two days."
d_ex_police_04_14,The boss would have had my hide.
d_ex_police_04_15,Did something happen?
d_ex_police_04_16,Just a minor miscommunication. 'Fraid I can't divulge much more than that.
d_ex_police_04_17,"Viper nudges me in the arm, hinting at something I have no idea could be."
d_ex_police_04_18,Ugh... I can see all the headlines now...
d_ex_police_04_19,"Rupee grabs onto my other arm, refusing to budge."
d_ex_police_04_20,Do you know who reported you?
d_ex_police_04_21,"No,"
d_ex_police_04_22,but I can make an educated guess.
d_ex_police_04_23,A competing mall owner?
d_ex_police_04_24,Another livestreamer?
d_ex_police_04_25,"I had considered that, but"
d_ex_police_04_26,"if it were me and I wanted to take down the competition, I'd use a different method."
d_ex_police_04_27,That's what I was thinking.
d_ex_police_04_28,It's probably someone from the media who works for another channel.
d_ex_police_04_29,There have been a lot of platforms popping up recently where people can livestream.
d_ex_police_04_30,"There're only so many people in the Ark, so the competition to gain followers is cutthroat."
d_ex_police_04_31,Some people even try to sabotage other streamers in order to bolster their own following.
d_ex_police_04_32,"I know you'd like to increase your followers too,"
d_ex_police_04_33,"but you're not gonna stoop to their level, are you?"
d_ex_police_04_34,Of course not.
d_ex_police_04_35,"Although it would be nice to arrange for whoever did this to have a little ""accident"","
d_ex_police_04_36,like say... a wardrobe malfunction.
d_ex_police_04_37,...
d_ex_police_04_38,You could always offer your fans a greater window into your private life if they subscribe to a higher tier.
d_ex_police_04_39,"What do you think, Babe?"
d_ex_police_04_40,"If you wanted, I'd have a special tier just for you."
d_ex_police_04_41,...
d_ex_police_04_42,No thanks.
d_ex_police_04_43,You're cute when you're flustered.
d_ex_police_04_44,I much prefer interacting face-to-face though. Livestreaming doesn't really do it for me.
d_ex_police_04_45,Too bad...
d_ex_police_04_46,Really?
d_ex_police_04_47,"Honestly though, livestreaming doesn't really do it for me."
d_ex_police_04_48,I much prefer interacting face-to-face.
d_ex_police_04_49,"Having said all she had to say, Viper takes her leave."
d_ex_police_04_50,What an idiot I've been...
d_ex_police_04_51,Have you ever considered something like what Viper proposed?
d_ex_police_04_52,"Me? No, never."
d_ex_police_04_53,"The only thing I like doing with my Lupins,"
d_ex_police_04_54,is shopping together.
d_ex_police_04_55,"And you're my favorite, Sweetie!"
d_ex_police_04_56,"As we start to walk, Rupee grabs my hand."
d_ex_police_04_57,Where are we going?
d_ex_police_04_58,"What else? We're going shopping, you silly goose!"
d_ex_police_04_59,"I can't make too much noise today, so I'll have to go with a more low-key vlog."
d_ex_shopping_05_title,Croquette Mania
d_ex_shopping_05_1,"Hey, check it out!"
d_ex_shopping_05_2,This place is famous for its Light Croquettes.
d_ex_shopping_05_3,Is this the place you kept going on about in the center?
d_ex_shopping_05_4,Smells▣※※good.
d_ex_shopping_05_5,"Sorry Sin, you can't have any because of your converter."
d_ex_shopping_05_6,"□▣It's okay, I can▣※blend it up later ※."
d_ex_shopping_05_7,Are you sure it'll taste good that way?

d_ex_shopping_05_10,Hello ladies.
d_ex_shopping_05_11,Hmm?
d_ex_shopping_05_12,"Oh, hey Counselor."
d_ex_shopping_05_13,Fancy bumping into you here. Did you come for some croquettes too?
d_ex_shopping_05_14,The Counselor likes croquettes too?
d_ex_shopping_05_15,I get why Guilty and Sin are here.
d_ex_shopping_05_16,"But what are you doing here, Quency?"
d_ex_shopping_05_17,Me? To try croquettes like everybody else.
d_ex_shopping_05_18,Why are you singling me out?
d_ex_shopping_05_19,"□▣Don't be so mean, Counselor□※."
d_ex_shopping_05_20,"▣※※Disadvantaged people like us should be looking out for each other, not▣□ questioning※□each other's motives."
d_ex_shopping_05_21,"Counselor, You didn't mean anything by what you said, did you?"

d_ex_shopping_05_23,▣※※That's not good□▣~
d_ex_shopping_05_24,"Counselor,※▣□10 points deducted."
d_ex_shopping_05_25,... I'm sorry.
d_ex_shopping_05_26,I guess I made a mistake.
d_ex_shopping_05_27,"Oh boy, you look so sad..."
d_ex_shopping_05_28,It kinda makes me feel bad seeing you like that.
d_ex_shopping_05_29,"Fine, I'll let it slide just this once."
d_ex_shopping_05_30,"To make it up to us, you can buy us some croquettes."
d_ex_shopping_05_31,"Woohoo, Counselor is buying!"
d_ex_shopping_05_32,Fine.

d_ex_shopping_05_42,Try not to get too carried away.
d_ex_shopping_05_43,Order as much as you could finish.
d_ex_shopping_05_44,"All right then... hmm, what should I get..."
d_ex_shopping_05_45,First things first: I'll take six regular croquettes.
d_ex_shopping_05_46,Six?
d_ex_shopping_05_47,Of course! We'll need at least two per person.
d_ex_shopping_05_48,Then I'll have three spicy croquettes...
d_ex_shopping_05_49,...
d_ex_shopping_05_50,Soon after.
d_ex_shopping_05_51,Here are the croquettes you ordered.
d_ex_shopping_05_52,"Wow, so fresh! You can still see the steam coming off them."
d_ex_shopping_05_53,*Sniff sniff* They certainly look appetizing.
d_ex_shopping_05_54,□※※I didn't bring□□my personal□▣blender.
d_ex_shopping_05_55,Personal blender?
d_ex_shopping_05_56,"If I want to ※□ eat anything while wearing this converter ※,"
d_ex_shopping_05_57,I've got to▣grind it up first※▣※with a blender.
d_ex_shopping_05_58,"It's a bit annoying,▣▣but※what can you do?"
d_ex_shopping_05_59,"Quency※▣ says▣these are super good though, so※▣▣"
d_ex_shopping_05_60,I'm▣▣willing to go through the trouble.
d_ex_shopping_05_61,"Excuse me, could you※□grind▣this ※up for me?"
d_ex_shopping_05_62,Sorry?
d_ex_shopping_05_63,※Grind▣ it up▣※ into mush▣!
d_ex_shopping_05_64,"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand..."
d_ex_shopping_05_65,My friend has sensitive teeth. Is there any chance you could run it through a blender so she can eat more comfortably?
d_ex_shopping_05_66,"Oh, certainly. Right away."
d_ex_shopping_05_67,"▣▣10▣※points deducted for you, Counselor."
d_ex_shopping_05_68,...
d_ex_shopping_05_69,"All right Guilty, open up and say ""ahhhh""..."
d_ex_shopping_05_70,Do I have to? It feels weird having you feed me.
d_ex_shopping_05_71,Why? I fed you all the time while we were in the center.
d_ex_shopping_05_72,"Exactly, and I hated it then too."
d_ex_shopping_05_73,You'd just keep staring at me... like you were looking through my soul...
d_ex_shopping_05_74,Should I feed you?
d_ex_shopping_05_75,Ask Sin to feed you.
d_ex_shopping_05_76,"You, Counselor? Sure, I guess."
d_ex_shopping_05_77,Sin...?
d_ex_shopping_05_78,Sin's busy enough trying to navigate these croquettes through her converter.
d_ex_shopping_05_79,Why don't you feed me?
d_ex_shopping_05_80,...
d_ex_shopping_05_81,...
d_ex_shopping_05_82,"Ugh, I'm so full!"
d_ex_shopping_05_83,*Gasp* How many did we eat?
d_ex_shopping_05_84,"They were so delicious, I guess we got a little carried away."
d_ex_shopping_05_85,Those really hit the spot.
d_ex_shopping_05_86,□※▣▣Good enough for... 10 points※I'd say!
d_ex_shopping_05_87,"Thanks for treating, Counselor."
d_ex_shopping_05_88,"Somehow, I felt they tasted better since you got them for us. We'll have to do this again sometime soon!"
d_ex_shopping_05_89,"All right, time to do some shopping. There are all sorts of things to see here."
d_ex_shopping_05_90,"We'll see you next time, Counselor."
d_ex_shopping_05_91,"We've got a busy schedule today, so we'll let you go."
d_ex_shopping_05_92,"Bye, Counselor."
d_ex_shopping_05_93,□▣※See you.
d_ex_shopping_05_94,"Quency, Guilty, and Sin leave."
d_ex_shopping_05_95,I want some croquette myself.
d_ex_shopping_05_96,... But I don't have any money left.
d_ex_shopping_05_97,I turn and leave the croquette store empty-handed and with empty pockets.
d_ex_hotel_05_title,Conspirators
d_ex_hotel_05_1,"Man, this▣※ hotel is massive※□!"
d_ex_hotel_05_2,▣※□Staying would really make you feel※※like you're in vacation mode▣※□.
d_ex_hotel_05_3,Says you...
d_ex_hotel_05_4,How much do you think this place costs?
d_ex_hotel_05_5,Think I could afford to buy it?
d_ex_hotel_05_6,Quency...
d_ex_hotel_05_7,There aren't enough bottle caps in the universe to buy this place.
d_ex_hotel_05_8,I was just asking!
d_ex_hotel_05_9,"Hey, ladies."
d_ex_hotel_05_10,"Hey, Counselor."
d_ex_hotel_05_11,Right on time.
d_ex_hotel_05_12,Why did you call me?
d_ex_hotel_05_13,Wh□▣at?
d_ex_hotel_05_14,"You mean□▣, you came here※without knowing※what we're doing today?□▣?"
d_ex_hotel_05_15,We're※▣▣※ doing something huge※※today.
d_ex_hotel_05_16,... We are?
d_ex_hotel_05_17,Guilty doesn't seem to know either.
d_ex_hotel_05_18,Huge in what way?
d_ex_hotel_05_19,"※※Well, to be□□honest... I don't really※know either▣※."
d_ex_hotel_05_20,※▣You really▣don't have a clue what's going on▣.
d_ex_hotel_05_21,※※And neither does▣Guilty▣apparently.
d_ex_hotel_05_22,"※※Actually, to be□□honest... I don't really※know either▣※."
d_ex_hotel_05_23,...
d_ex_hotel_05_24,"Don't tease the Counselor, Sin."
d_ex_hotel_05_25,It's only natural that no one knows what's going on.
d_ex_hotel_05_26,I said I'd let everyone know once we were at the hotel.
d_ex_hotel_05_27,"If I'd told anyone beforehand, none of you would have come."
d_ex_hotel_05_28,What is it?
d_ex_hotel_05_29,You're all going to help me put the finishing touches on a new escape route.
d_ex_hotel_05_30,I already started digging it around the back of the hotel.
d_ex_hotel_05_31,"I dug all the way through a few rooms, but it became too hard to finish on my own."
d_ex_hotel_05_32,But I'm not really in the working mood right now...
d_ex_hotel_05_33,I should have※▣▣ expected※□something like this.
d_ex_hotel_05_34,Do I need to help as well?
d_ex_hotel_05_35,Of course. Why wouldn't you?
d_ex_hotel_05_36,But...
d_ex_hotel_05_37,I'll take it that everyone agrees to assist?
d_ex_hotel_05_38,I haven't agr...
d_ex_hotel_05_39,"All right, that's settled! Let's head in."
d_ex_hotel_05_40,"※□Sorry Counselor,※□ you're▣in the same boat as us.▣□▣"
d_ex_hotel_05_41,...
d_ex_hotel_05_42,"Quency, Guilty, and Sin go inside the hotel."
d_ex_hotel_05_43,Hm... Let's see.
d_ex_hotel_05_44,I think we can start digging near the fan.
d_ex_hotel_05_45,Why do you want an escape route that leads to a hotel room?
d_ex_hotel_05_46,For a good night's sleep.
d_ex_hotel_05_47,What do you mean?
d_ex_hotel_05_48,I can't sleep very well in the Rehabilitation Center.
d_ex_hotel_05_49,"A few days ago, I came here to rest for a while,"
d_ex_hotel_05_50,and I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow.
d_ex_hotel_05_51,It made me start wondering if a different bed would help me sleep better.
d_ex_hotel_05_52,The beds here are super fluffy.
d_ex_hotel_05_53,"Wow, Quency is right. It feels like a cloud."
d_ex_hotel_05_54,Exactly. I'll be able to get a good night's sleep here.
d_ex_hotel_05_55,Why can't you just rent a room here like everyone else?
d_ex_hotel_05_56,"In case you forgot Counselor, I haven't been rehabilitated yet."
d_ex_hotel_05_57,Don't you think it might set off some alarms if I waltz into a hotel lobby?
d_ex_hotel_05_58,Fair enough.
d_ex_hotel_05_59,"Well, what do you say everyone?"
d_ex_hotel_05_60,Can you lend me a hand?
d_ex_hotel_05_61,This place is way different from the Rehabilitation Center.
d_ex_hotel_05_62,"The beds in the center are as hard as a rock, and freezing."
d_ex_hotel_05_63,The ones here are so fluffy... I kinda want to take a nap...
d_ex_hotel_05_64,There's even※▣▣ a TV※.
d_ex_hotel_05_65,※▣□And a□ shower.
d_ex_hotel_05_66,"With warm water, □□no less※※□."
d_ex_hotel_05_67,"Oh my god, they've□▣even got a▣▣※blender! ※ 50 points for that※※!"
d_ex_hotel_05_68,Neither Sin nor Guilty is paying any attention to Quency.
d_ex_hotel_05_69,*Sigh* I knew I couldn't count on those two.
d_ex_hotel_05_70,"Looks like that leaves only you, Counselor."
d_ex_hotel_05_71,... Fine.
d_ex_hotel_05_72,A couple of hours later.
d_ex_hotel_05_73,"After Quency and I removed the wings from the fan,
we dig a route that is big enough for a person to get through."
d_ex_hotel_05_74,That's the first phase of construction finished.
d_ex_hotel_05_75,We can do the finishing touches a little later.
d_ex_hotel_05_76,What do you think? Does it look good?
d_ex_hotel_05_77,You truly are a master escape artist.
d_ex_hotel_05_78,What happens if you get caught?
d_ex_hotel_05_79,"Nice try Counselor, but flattery won't get you anywhere with me."
d_ex_hotel_05_80,That won't happen. People don't pay attention to areas like this.
d_ex_hotel_05_81,"Nicely done, you two."
d_ex_hotel_05_82,□▣Looks like a nice▣※route▣※.
d_ex_hotel_05_83,I'd say that's worth...※※□▣30 points.
d_ex_hotel_05_84,Good job everyone... even though the Counselor and I were the only two who did anything.
d_ex_hotel_05_85,Can we hang out at the hotel a little longer?
d_ex_hotel_05_86,"Yeah, □▣ can we?"
d_ex_hotel_05_87,I wanna stay too!
d_ex_hotel_05_88,"You deserve a break too, Counselor, especially after all that hard work."
d_ex_hotel_05_89,"*Knock, knock.*"
d_ex_hotel_05_90,??
d_ex_hotel_05_91,Who could that be?
d_ex_hotel_05_92,I'm not expecting any visitors.
d_ex_hotel_05_93,※□Let's▣hide※!
d_ex_hotel_05_94,*Boom! Bang*
d_ex_hotel_05_95,"Quency, Guilty, and Sin all crawl inside the newly dug-out passage."
d_ex_hotel_05_96,Why are you two even hiding in the first place?
d_ex_hotel_05_97,"Oh right, we've already been rehabilitated..."
d_ex_hotel_05_98,"Whatever, ※□who cares?"
d_ex_hotel_05_99,※※We're helping□▣each other out※▣.
d_ex_hotel_05_100,You call this helping?
d_ex_hotel_05_101,Is anyone there?
d_ex_hotel_05_102,"Just be quiet, everyone. If anyone discovers this route, we're finished."
d_ex_hotel_05_103,I'll have done all that digging for nothing.
d_ex_hotel_05_104,"Counselor, take care of them so we don't get caught!"
d_ex_hotel_05_105,Quency whispers quietly.
d_ex_hotel_05_106,Okay.
d_ex_hotel_05_107,You can trust me.
d_ex_hotel_05_108,"*Bark, bark*"
d_ex_hotel_05_109,"You wanna go inside, Volt? Okay, let's check it out."
d_ex_hotel_05_110,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_05_111,Hey there.
d_ex_hotel_05_112,Greenhorn? What are you doing here?
d_ex_hotel_05_113,I'm just here chillaxin'.
d_ex_hotel_05_114,I came to enjoy some alone time.
d_ex_hotel_05_115,Chill... chill what?
d_ex_hotel_05_116,"Speak properly, will you?"
d_ex_hotel_05_117,Alone time?
d_ex_hotel_05_118,"I'm not intruding, am I?"
d_ex_hotel_05_119,"No, you're fine."
d_ex_hotel_05_120,What are you doing here?
d_ex_hotel_05_121,"I was walking Volt,"
d_ex_hotel_05_122,and saw this gaping hole behind the hotel.
d_ex_hotel_05_123,"I figured someone could end up tripping and hurting themselves, so I was gonna fill it back up,"
d_ex_hotel_05_124,but it turns out the hole really went down further than I thought.
d_ex_hotel_05_125,Sounds like she found Quency's escape route.
d_ex_hotel_05_126,I'm sure it's nothing. You can just leave it alone.
d_ex_hotel_05_127,I don't think filling it back up is worth the trouble.
d_ex_hotel_05_128,How can you say that? Someone could be walking along and accidentally trip and fall into that hole.
d_ex_hotel_05_129,Who would dig such a deep hole anyway?
d_ex_hotel_05_130,Owwww!
d_ex_hotel_05_131,"Haha, don't worry Volt, I know you're not the culprit."
d_ex_hotel_05_132,"Actually, it's a good thing that I ran into you, Greenhorn."
d_ex_hotel_05_133,"Centi has the day off, so I was contemplating how to best go about filling that hole."
d_ex_hotel_05_134,"Since you're here, you can be my assistant."
d_ex_hotel_05_135,Me?
d_ex_hotel_05_136,Are you busy?
d_ex_hotel_05_137,It's not that...
d_ex_hotel_05_138,Then what's the problem? You seem awfully reluctant.
d_ex_hotel_05_139,"... No, it's okay."
d_ex_hotel_05_140,"Don't worry, it won't take too much time."
d_ex_hotel_05_141,Right this way.
d_ex_hotel_05_142,... Okay.
d_ex_hotel_05_143,"Perhaps it was my imagination, but I swear I could hear Quency wailing from behind the fan."
d_ex_powerplant_04_title,Cat? Dog?
d_ex_powerplant_04_1,"After hearing a commotion near the generator, I head towards that area."
d_ex_powerplant_04_2,Cut her off there!
d_ex_powerplant_04_3,Got it!
d_ex_powerplant_04_4,Don't touch her!
d_ex_powerplant_04_5,Throw a rock!
d_ex_powerplant_04_6,Are you sure?
d_ex_powerplant_04_7,"Yes, so that she doesn't go that way!"
d_ex_powerplant_04_8,"If she goes that way, the entire generator might short-circuit."
d_ex_powerplant_04_9,"But still, I don't wanna hurt it..."
d_ex_powerplant_04_10,What are you two doing?
d_ex_powerplant_04_11,"Oh, Cutey!
It's good you're here. You can help us."
d_ex_powerplant_04_12,She's running around with all these loose electrical wires strewn about. It's dangerous.
d_ex_powerplant_04_13,"We've been trying to coax her out, but she keeps burrowing herself in deeper."
d_ex_powerplant_04_14,"Treats aren't working, and neither has yelling."
d_ex_powerplant_04_15,"The longer she stays there, the more danger she's in. If there's an electrical discharge, that'll be all she wrote."
d_ex_powerplant_04_16,Do you have any other suggestions as to how we can get her out?
d_ex_powerplant_04_17,I feel like you might know.
d_ex_powerplant_04_18,Depends on what it is.
d_ex_powerplant_04_19,"You keep saying ""she"", but is it a cat or a dog?"
d_ex_powerplant_04_20,Jackal.
d_ex_powerplant_04_21,It's Jackal.
d_ex_powerplant_04_22,...
d_ex_powerplant_04_23,"You mean the animal, or..."
d_ex_powerplant_04_24,Hehe! Hehehehe!
d_ex_powerplant_04_25,Oh. Jackal.
d_ex_powerplant_04_26,Jackal suddenly bursts out and scurries around.
d_ex_powerplant_04_27,Just look at all these obstacles! This is amazing!
d_ex_powerplant_04_28,"*Buzz, buzz*"
d_ex_powerplant_04_29,"Huh? What's this wire?
Can I bite it?"
d_ex_powerplant_04_30,"*Buzz, buzz*"
d_ex_powerplant_04_31,"Hey, no! Get away, get away!"
d_ex_powerplant_04_32,"Be a good girl, now. Come here."
d_ex_powerplant_04_33,Maxell and Admi are in panic mode.
d_ex_powerplant_04_34,Hehe! Hehehehe!
d_ex_powerplant_04_35,*Buzzzz*
d_ex_powerplant_04_36,This is clearly a dangerous situation.
d_ex_powerplant_04_37,What should I do?
d_ex_powerplant_04_38,Call out to Jackal loudly.
d_ex_powerplant_04_39,Throw a rock.
d_ex_powerplant_04_40,"The situation may be dire, but even so, throwing a rock might be a bit extreme."
d_ex_powerplant_04_41,"I doubt it would severely injure her... but still, there has to be a better way."
d_ex_powerplant_04_42,I'll just call out to her.
d_ex_powerplant_04_43,Jackal!!
d_ex_powerplant_04_44,!!
d_ex_powerplant_04_45,Commander!
d_ex_powerplant_04_46,Come here!
d_ex_powerplant_04_47,Coming!
d_ex_powerplant_04_48,Jackal bounds over and plops down in front of me.
d_ex_powerplant_04_49,When did you get here? Are you here to play with me?
d_ex_powerplant_04_50,...
d_ex_powerplant_04_51,...
d_ex_powerplant_04_52,"If you are, come and run around with me."
d_ex_powerplant_04_53,"Sure, we can run outside."
d_ex_powerplant_04_54,Hehe! Hold my hand!
d_ex_powerplant_04_55,I grab Jackal's hand and head outside.
d_ex_powerplant_04_56,"Very impressive, Cutey."
d_ex_powerplant_04_57,In more ways than one.

d_ex_hospital_04_5,...
d_ex_hospital_04_6,"If you don't open your mouth, I can't see your teeth."
d_ex_hospital_04_7,...
d_ex_hospital_04_8,Jackal.
d_ex_hospital_04_9,?
d_ex_hospital_04_10,Jackal refuses to open her mouth.
d_ex_hospital_04_11,"If your teeth are hurting, you need to get treated."
d_ex_hospital_04_12,...
d_ex_hospital_04_13,Hmm... what to do...
d_ex_hospital_04_14,Should we administer some medication that will get her to open her mouth?
d_ex_hospital_04_15,!!
d_ex_hospital_04_16,Or perhaps a shot could achieve the same effect?
d_ex_hospital_04_17,!!!!
d_ex_hospital_04_18,"Or better yet, some medication, followed by a shot."
d_ex_hospital_04_19,!!!!!!!!
d_ex_hospital_04_20,"Mary, I believe the patient is becoming agitated."
d_ex_hospital_04_21,"Haha, is that right?"
d_ex_hospital_04_22,"Well, if she refuses to open her mouth, then I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to help."
d_ex_hospital_04_23,Jackal.
d_ex_hospital_04_24,What are you so afraid of?
d_ex_hospital_04_25,...
d_ex_hospital_04_26,We're just going to take a look first.
d_ex_hospital_04_27,"If, once I do that, I determine there's something wrong, I'll only proceed with your consent."
d_ex_hospital_04_28,I won't do anything you won't agree to.
d_ex_hospital_04_29,...!
d_ex_hospital_04_30,I promise.
d_ex_hospital_04_31,"So go ahead and open up for me, will you?"

d_ex_hospital_04_38,What's wrong?
d_ex_hospital_04_39,There's something stuck in her molar.
d_ex_hospital_04_40,Is this... a metal shard?
d_ex_hospital_04_41,... Unbelievable.
d_ex_hospital_04_42,What in the world...?
d_ex_hospital_04_43,I need to remove this at once.
d_ex_hospital_04_44,No!
d_ex_hospital_04_45,??
d_ex_hospital_04_46,I'm scared that it'll hurt!
d_ex_hospital_04_47,"Jackal, it won't hurt. I'm just taking it out."
d_ex_hospital_04_48,No!!
d_ex_hospital_04_49,...
d_ex_hospital_04_50,I just remembered something that Poli told me.
d_ex_hospital_04_51,"Apparently, someone ripped apart the lock to one of the jail cells,"
d_ex_hospital_04_52,and she intends to capture the culprit by searching for someone with metal shards stuck in their teeth.
d_ex_hospital_04_53,...
d_ex_hospital_04_54,"As a matter of fact, I believe she's stopping by the hospital in about a minute or so."
d_ex_hospital_04_55,!!
d_ex_hospital_04_56,"Oh, I think she may have arrived a little earlier than expected. Those might be her footsteps."

d_ex_hospital_04_60,Did you get it?
d_ex_hospital_04_61,"Yes, it's out."

d_ex_wingofvictory_04_19,I'll keep that in mind♡
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_20,The three of us sit down at a picnic table.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_21,"To be honest, making friends isn't that difficult."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_22,"At the end of the day, it's all about presenting yourself in a way that people will admire."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_23,How do I do that?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_24,"First, it's good to target someone you feel might connect with you."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_25,"If you're lucky, they'll view you favorably right from the beginning♡"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_26,Viper scoots closer to me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_27,It's not really important what you talk about.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_28,A few simple gestures will do the trick.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_29,Viper starts to gently caress my hand.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_30,Some light physical contact.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_31,Humans can't deny their biological urges.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_32,"By doing this, you're giving someone a signal that you're interested in them, and you're inviting them to do the same."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_33,I see!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_34,Let me try.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_35,Vesti also scoots close and starts to caress my hand.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_36,My knuckles are starting to hurt from the constant pressure.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_37,"After the initial contact, it's easy."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_38,"You arrange to meet with someone as often as you can, then you can talk and open up to each other."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_39,I think that covers the basics.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_40,Open up to each other... open up...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_41,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_42,"Is something wrong, Honey?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_43,"Nothing, I'm just surprised is all. That went much more smoothly than I thought it would."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_44,"Well, I thought I'd do you a favor."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_45,You know what that means though... you owe me now♡
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_46,Okay.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_47,Hehe.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_48,Wait... did you just call me?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_49,No.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_50,Are you sure?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_51,"I turn my head to look at Viper, and am greeted by..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_52,Harran? What are you doing here?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_53,I came by because I have something to give Isabel.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_54,I assumed she would be with you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_55,...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_56,"However, it seems I was wrong in my assumption."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_57,What are you all up to?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_58,We were teaching Vesti how to make friends.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_59,That's easy. Here.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_60,Harran gives Vesti a small bottle filled with a pink-colored liquid.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_61,It's a love potion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_62,A what?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_63,"Friendship, love... what's the difference?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_64,"Once you get the hang of using that potion, you can use it however you see fit."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_65,"Well, the most important thing is having an open heart and an open mind, after all..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_66,"Love potion, huh?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_67,I wonder what effect it would have on someone?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_68,I can assure you that anything I make will be effective.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_69,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_70,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_71,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_72,"Viper, Vesti, and Harran all go silent, then quietly turn their heads in my direction."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_73,"Wait. You're kidding, right?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_74,Isabel isn't here yet anyway.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_75,We can have some fun while we wait.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_76,"Yeah! And I was just saying how you owe me, Honey♡"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_77,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_78,"Please Commander, would you do this for me?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_79,Vesti hands me the bottle.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_80,What are you waiting for? Hurry up and drink it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_81,I'm curious to see how you look when you're in love.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_82,... Fine.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_83,I close my eyes and drink the potion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_84,How is it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_85,Do you feel any different?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_86,I...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_87,"I stare at Vesti, Viper, and Harran one by one."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_88,I don't feel any different.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_89,I don't think so.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_90,That's too bad...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_91,It probably feels like there's no effect because I've already opened up my heart to you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_92,C-could that be it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_93,I didn't know that was possible.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_94,"Now that Viper gave us some pointers, we can put them into practice next time."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_95,Yeah!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_96,*Beep*
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_97,Uh-oh...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_98,I have to get going. Emma wants me to come back for dinner.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_99,"Okay, be careful on the way back."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_100,I will.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_101,Thanks everyone for all your help.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_102,Vesti turns around and leaves.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_103,"Thanks for doing that, Harran."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_104,What do you mean?
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_105,For giving me a placebo instead of a real love potion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_106,I did give you the real thing...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_107,But that would mean...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_108,*Thump*
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_109,...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_110,"All of a sudden, it seems like a light is emanating from Harran and Viper."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_111,"Hehe, something wrong?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_112,"Dang, that potion must be some strong stuff."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_113,*Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump*
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_114,My heart beats faster and faster as Viper and Harran come closer.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_115,Wa-wait!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_116,"Commander, look at me."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_117,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_118,I quickly focus my eyes on a pebble on the ground.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_119,"... For some reason, the pebble suddenly appears rather lovely."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_120,Don't try to resist!
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_121,Even though it is amusing to watch you squirm.
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_122,"The potion should last for about an hour. In the meantime, why don't we enjoy ourselves?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_123,"Honey, I'd much prefer you lavish some attention on me instead of a pebble."
d_ex_wingofvictory_04_124,"I've got to ward off Harran and Viper's efforts to seduce me, at least until the potion wears off."
d_ex_court_04_title,"Live, Laugh, Love Finances"
d_ex_court_04_1,I leave the court with Helm.
d_ex_court_04_2,"Thanks for coming with me today, Subordinate."
d_ex_court_04_3,I learned a lot from the legal side of things.
d_ex_court_04_4,Have you made a decision?
d_ex_court_04_5,"Yes. Legally speaking, there isn't a problem."
d_ex_court_04_6,"There is, however, a problem morally."
d_ex_court_04_7,I won't take this donation.
d_ex_court_04_8,Will you be okay?
d_ex_court_04_9,"To be honest, I'm not sure. The squad might be disintegrated next month because of a lack of funding."
d_ex_court_04_10,I can't allow that to happen.
d_ex_court_04_11,We'll figure something out.
d_ex_court_04_12,I know. Thank you.
d_ex_court_04_13,But I feel I should apologize to you.
d_ex_court_04_14,Why's that?
d_ex_court_04_15,Because I've already come up with another solution.
d_ex_court_04_16,I asked for a few advisors to give us some guidance with our current situation.
d_ex_court_04_17,Who?
d_ex_court_04_18,One is a CEO who runs a multi-million dollar company.
d_ex_court_04_19,And the other is someone who is incredibly street-smart.
d_ex_court_04_20,A CEO?
d_ex_court_04_21,Street smart?
d_ex_court_04_22,"Yes, someone who thinks differently from people like you and me. We aren't interested in profit, but they are."
d_ex_court_04_23,They're bound to know all there is to know when it comes to dealing with finances.
d_ex_court_04_24,I'm sure they'd have plenty of useful advice for us.
d_ex_court_04_25,"Precisely. As you know, there are plenty of predators out there who target the weak and vulnerable."
d_ex_court_04_26,"In order for us to better know how to deal with these kinds of people, we need to hear from someone who is familiar with how they operate."
d_ex_court_04_27,"I have a meeting coming up soon, would you want to tag along?"
d_ex_court_04_28,It'd feel nice to have you with me.
d_ex_court_04_29,Sure.
d_ex_court_04_30,I appreciate it.
d_ex_court_04_31,The two people Helm called for help are...
d_ex_court_04_32,"Oh, hi Sweetie!"
d_ex_court_04_33,Fancy seeing you here!
d_ex_court_04_34,... Rupee and Viper.
d_ex_court_04_35,Thank you both for coming. I really appreciate it.
d_ex_court_04_36,Something doesn't feel right...
d_ex_court_04_37,What is it?
d_ex_court_04_38,I don't know. Something just feels out of place...
d_ex_court_04_39,Hmm...
d_ex_court_04_40,Yan and Dolla from Talentum were my first choices.
d_ex_court_04_41,"But they had their hands full, and they would ask for too much money, so I had to go with these two."
d_ex_court_04_42,"Hey, I'm a busy woman as well, but I'm more than capable of dishing out some advice while I'm at it."
d_ex_court_04_43,... Although I must admit this is my first time doing this.
d_ex_court_04_44,"Anyway, the point is that we're the best you're gonna get, and you can't beat my price: free."
d_ex_court_04_45,"Of course, for services rendered, you will owe me a small favor♡"
d_ex_court_04_46,"That's perfectly fine. Since this is an official request from the Aegis squad,"
d_ex_court_04_47,we will do everything we can to assist.
d_ex_court_04_48,"Rupee, you'll be compensated for your services,"
d_ex_court_04_49,but my only concern is that it won't be to your satisfaction.
d_ex_court_04_50,"Don't worry about any payment, I don't want any."
d_ex_court_04_51,I've always wanted to do something like this.
d_ex_court_04_52,I see you're trying to gain the upper hand in the negotiations. You're a CEO all right.
d_ex_court_04_53,Um... Thanks?
d_ex_court_04_54,"It's fine. Since we're from the lower strata, we'll give you whatever you want."
d_ex_court_04_55,All I ask is for you to take our current financial strain into consideration.
d_ex_court_04_56,What are you...?
d_ex_court_04_57,These are our financial statements. Do you have any suggestions on how we can get ourselves out of this mess?
d_ex_court_04_58,Wha... you're just handing over your financial statements?
d_ex_court_04_59,...
d_ex_court_04_60,This is getting interesting! I'm glad I came.
d_ex_court_04_61,Don't even think about it.
d_ex_court_04_62,What? I didn't do anything.
d_ex_court_04_63,You were about to do something.
d_ex_court_04_64,... Maybe.
d_ex_court_04_65,...
d_ex_court_04_66,"Oh, keep your shirt on."
d_ex_court_04_67,"Relax, we're all here to have a good time, aren't we?"
d_ex_court_04_68,I'm just having a little more fun that everyone else.
d_ex_court_04_69,If you say so.
d_ex_court_04_70,"Anyway, this is all related to funding allocated by the Central Government, right?"
d_ex_court_04_71,Getting involved with this stuff can get messy real quick.
d_ex_court_04_72,Let's see... so this is the total amount of donations... then expenses over here...
d_ex_court_04_73,!!!
d_ex_court_04_74,Are maintenance costs for the ship really this high?
d_ex_court_04_75,Yes. We're trying to find ways to reduce expenses as much as possible.
d_ex_court_04_76,I'm open to suggestions.
d_ex_court_04_77,Hmm...
d_ex_court_04_78,I've got it! Perhaps you could do a bit of spring cleaning with your subcontractors.
d_ex_court_04_79,I'm sure it'd help you see things more clearly. Kinda like when you tidy up your desk at work.
d_ex_court_04_80,"I see, so the more suppliers we rely on, the higher expenses will be."
d_ex_court_04_81,I should look more into our vendors and their workflows.
d_ex_court_04_82,Precisely!
d_ex_court_04_83,Let me have a look.
d_ex_court_04_84,"Hmm... Hey, I know this vendor."
d_ex_court_04_85,Viper points at a food vendor on the financial statement.
d_ex_court_04_86,"It seems like they've been doing a good job, but I'm willing to bet they've been skimming a bit off the top."
d_ex_court_04_87,Our squad can attest to the quality of their work.
d_ex_court_04_88,"Oh my goodness, look at this clothing supply company!"
d_ex_court_04_89,They're infamous for using low-quality fabric to save on costs. Let's investigate them!
d_ex_court_04_90,Do you think there might be more companies like them?
d_ex_court_04_91,"Maybe not at first, but once we start digging, I'm sure more will pop up."
d_ex_court_04_92,"To greedy little blood suckers like these companies, government funding is too sweet to resist."
d_ex_court_04_93,"They're like bloated rats eating everything in sight, and accidentally ingesting rat poison while they're at it."
d_ex_court_04_94,"This might take some time, perhaps we should move somewhere else."
d_ex_court_04_95,I'll prepare some light snacks.
d_ex_court_04_96,Really? Could I have a Monc Blanc from YONG Bakery?
d_ex_court_04_97,I'll take the Sweet & Cream Shortcake.
d_ex_court_04_98,Sorry... but I think those are a bit outside of my wheelhouse.
d_ex_court_04_99,"No problem, I'll prepare us some snacks then."
d_ex_court_04_100,We can head towards our temporary offices in Rushae. There are plenty of great eateries in that area.
d_ex_court_04_101,I'm fine with anything.
d_ex_court_04_102,"Thank you, I'll make it up to you later."
d_ex_court_04_103,Don't worry about it.
d_ex_court_04_104,"Once we're done with our consultation, we can go try on some new clothes."
d_ex_court_04_105,"I'm sure we'll find plenty of outfits that will look good on you, Helm."
d_ex_court_04_106,"Oooh, count me in♡"
d_ex_court_04_107,I'm starting to feel like I should find an excuse to bow out of this situation.
d_ex_court_04_108,"Well, in that case, I'll be..."
d_ex_court_04_109,"Hmm? Sweetie, where are you going?"
d_ex_court_04_110,"You're not trying to slink away, are you?"
d_ex_court_04_111,"C'mon, stay! The more the merrier."
d_ex_court_04_112,"Besides, we haven't finished taking their advice."
d_ex_court_04_113,...
d_ex_court_04_114,"After a few hours, we found ourselves in the temporary office in the Outpost."
d_ex_court_04_115,Really?! I know that commander too!
d_ex_court_04_116,They didn't go missing. They were just in the Outer Rim.
d_ex_court_04_117,"Hey Helm, do you want to try some of this?"
d_ex_court_04_118,"Sure, thanks."
d_ex_court_04_119,I just don't understand. Why give up everything that comes with being a commander and go to the Outer Rim?
d_ex_court_04_120,"Wow, these cookies are delicious..."
d_ex_court_04_121,"Yeah, they're my favorite."
d_ex_court_04_122,"Who knows, maybe it's something in their blood. For some people, a life of crime is the only way to live."
d_ex_court_04_123,"And besides, the Outer Rim isn't such a bad place to live."
d_ex_court_04_124,...
d_ex_court_04_125,"Unsurprisingly, our financial advisory session quickly went by the wayside, and soon devolved into an ordinary social gathering."
d_ex_court_04_126,"Oh, right! Didn't we say we were going to try on some new clothes?"
d_ex_court_04_127,"I believe you did mention that. I must admit, I'm very much looking forward to it..."
d_ex_court_04_128,I usually don't have many opportunities to wear extravagant clothing.
d_ex_court_04_129,About time we got to the fun part of the evening!
d_ex_court_04_130,It's been approximately 4 hours since we started chatting. Sounds like the ladies are about to switch gears.
d_ex_court_04_131,"Well, I'll be off."
d_ex_court_04_132,"Ah, you're right. I suppose the advisory session has already ended."
d_ex_court_04_133,Thank you for toda...
d_ex_court_04_134,"But Sweetie, you have to see how I look!"
d_ex_court_04_135,Yes. We need someone to tell us how we look!
d_ex_court_04_136,I'm sure Helm would like for you to stay and give her some feedback as well.
d_ex_court_04_137,I-I...
d_ex_court_04_138,...
d_ex_court_04_139,"The impromptu fashion ends up going on all night, during which I sat and watched."
d_ex_theater_05_title,Songs and Bottle Caps
d_ex_theater_05_1,Aria is in the midst of rehearsing for her performance.
d_ex_theater_05_2,For I am as unfettered as the wind.
d_ex_theater_05_3,"The confinements of this world cannot contain me,"
d_ex_theater_05_4,"nor can its cruel tendrils constrain me. I am a thief, as free as the wind."
d_ex_theater_05_5,...
d_ex_theater_05_6,A thief being free?
d_ex_theater_05_7,Something wrong?
d_ex_theater_05_8,The words free and thief don't go with each other.
d_ex_theater_05_9,All the criminals in the Ark are incarcerated in the Rehabilitation Center.
d_ex_theater_05_10,And I've never heard of a criminal who escaped from that place.
d_ex_theater_05_11,"Actually, there is one. Her name's..."
d_ex_theater_05_12,What makes you think no one has ever escaped that place?
d_ex_theater_05_13,You have no imagination.
d_ex_theater_05_14,!!
d_ex_theater_05_15,"I look all around me, but can't see anything."
d_ex_theater_05_16,Who is it?
d_ex_theater_05_17,Who do you think?
d_ex_theater_05_18,"A thief, as free as the wind, who can never be caught!"
d_ex_theater_05_19,Quency?
d_ex_theater_05_20,"Maestro, do you know who that is?"
d_ex_theater_05_21,The Rehabilitation Center's resident escape artist.
d_ex_theater_05_22,A free spirit.
d_ex_theater_05_23,Escape artist?
d_ex_theater_05_24,I never did like that nickname.
d_ex_theater_05_25,A free spirit?
d_ex_theater_05_26,That has a nice ring to it.
d_ex_theater_05_27,Quency jumps down from the ceiling.
d_ex_theater_05_28,So that's where you were hiding.
d_ex_theater_05_29,Who said I was hiding?
d_ex_theater_05_30,I was just trying to locate one of my escape routes.
d_ex_theater_05_31,"Aria, this is Quency. She's the one who's escaped from the Rehabilitation Center."
d_ex_theater_05_32,She has?
d_ex_theater_05_33,"Hi, nice to meet ya."
d_ex_theater_05_34,The pleasure is all mine. I'm Aria.
d_ex_theater_05_35,I know who you are. You're a famous opera singer.
d_ex_theater_05_36,I heard that a ticket to one of your shows costs an arm and a leg.
d_ex_theater_05_37,"And to think, here I was getting a sneak preview for free, hehe!"
d_ex_theater_05_38,Must be my lucky day.
d_ex_theater_05_39,Did you really escape from the Rehabilitation Center?
d_ex_theater_05_40,I sure did. That's why I'm here before you today.
d_ex_theater_05_41,"But once I'm done sorting out my affairs, I'll head back."
d_ex_theater_05_42,You make it sound like you're heading back home after running errands...
d_ex_theater_05_43,"They feed me and put a roof over my head, so it is kinda like my home."
d_ex_theater_05_44,Do they ever try and stop you from leaving?
d_ex_theater_05_45,All the time. The guards are constantly blocking up my routes.
d_ex_theater_05_46,I'm constantly creating new ones so that I can come out.
d_ex_theater_05_47,"Like, for example, hiding in this theater while you were rehearsing."
d_ex_theater_05_48,You're so certain that you'll be able to escape day after day.
d_ex_theater_05_49,I admire your confidence.
d_ex_theater_05_50,Have you ever thought you might fail?
d_ex_theater_05_51,Never.
d_ex_theater_05_52,Not even once?
d_ex_theater_05_53,Not even once.
d_ex_theater_05_54,... I see.
d_ex_theater_05_55,Aria stares at Quency with great intensity.
d_ex_theater_05_56,I feel like I have a sense of who you are.
d_ex_theater_05_57,"Someone bursting with confidence, someone who is certain"
d_ex_theater_05_58,"that they'll never be caught, and the freedom that comes with that."
d_ex_theater_05_59,"Do you, perchance, have a moment to spare?"
d_ex_theater_05_60,"Sure, I've got lots of time."
d_ex_theater_05_61,Why?
d_ex_theater_05_62,"If you're interested, would you care to listen to one of my songs?"
d_ex_theater_05_63,Sure!
d_ex_theater_05_64,"Very well, I'll begin."
d_ex_theater_05_65,Aria clears her throat.
d_ex_theater_05_66,For I am as unfettered as the wind.
d_ex_theater_05_67,"The confinements of this world cannot contain me,"
d_ex_theater_05_68,"nor can its cruel tendrils constrain me. I am a thief, as free as the wind."
d_ex_theater_05_69,"*Clap, clap, clap*"
d_ex_theater_05_70,"Bravo! I can't quite put my finger on it, but it somehow sounds better than before."
d_ex_theater_05_71,How to describe it... Hearing it makes me feel... refreshed! Like a cool breeze on my face.
d_ex_theater_05_72,I'm glad that you got something out of it.
d_ex_theater_05_73,"Since you were kind enough to give me a private performance,"
d_ex_theater_05_74,I feel like I should give you something in return.
d_ex_theater_05_75,Here.
d_ex_theater_05_76,Quency hands over a bottle cap to Aria.
d_ex_theater_05_77,!!
d_ex_theater_05_78,A bottle cap?
d_ex_theater_05_79,"Yeah, a super special one too!"
d_ex_theater_05_80,... Thanks.
d_ex_theater_05_81,"It's certainly not what I expected, but I appreciate it."
d_ex_theater_05_82,Aria takes the bottle cap.
d_ex_theater_05_83,I'm just happy you like it.
d_ex_theater_05_84,I thought someone as famous as you would hate getting something like this.
d_ex_theater_05_85,I can tell by your voice
d_ex_theater_05_86,"that this cap means a lot to you,"
d_ex_theater_05_87,!!
d_ex_theater_05_88,Is that right?
d_ex_theater_05_89,Very much so.
d_ex_theater_05_90,"I thought an opera singer like you would be all hoity-toity, but you're actually really nice."
d_ex_theater_05_91,I'll try and use this route more often in the future.
d_ex_theater_05_92,You're always welcome to stop by.
d_ex_theater_05_93,"However, I would like to hear more of your stories next time."
d_ex_theater_05_94,"As someone who spends most of her life on the stage, I don't have many opportunities to hear stories like yours."
d_ex_theater_05_95,Sure thing!
d_ex_theater_05_96,"If you're that interested,"
d_ex_theater_05_97,I'll bring two bottle caps next time.
d_ex_theater_05_98,I can't wait.
d_ex_theater_05_99,"After exchanging a few more words, Quency and Aria part ways,"
d_ex_theater_05_100,having promised each other that they will meet again.
d_ex_tower_04_title,The Case of the (not-so) Violent (ex) criminal
d_ex_tower_04_1,15:22. Radio Tower.
d_ex_tower_04_2,Watson.
d_ex_tower_04_3,Did you know?
d_ex_tower_04_4,"Of the three criminal masterminds who are said to dominate the Rehabilitation Center,"
d_ex_tower_04_5,66.6% of them have re-entered the Outpost.
d_ex_tower_04_6,Why don't you just say 2 out of 3?
d_ex_tower_04_7,You make it sound like they broke out. They were brought here.
d_ex_tower_04_8,That's not the point.
d_ex_tower_04_9,The important thing is that I wouldn't be surprised if they end up creating some kind of incident.
d_ex_tower_04_10,"But have no fear, I, Novel, am here to prevent such tomfoolery!"
d_ex_tower_04_11,"By setting up surveillance cameras on the radio tower which has the most radio waves,"
d_ex_tower_04_12,"and by begging Exia, I was able to acquire the CCTV footage."
d_ex_tower_04_13,Sounds like you're a criminal to me...
d_ex_tower_04_14,"Watson, please."
d_ex_tower_04_15,"After watching this footage, you'll change your mind."
d_ex_tower_04_16,Counselor. Counselor...
d_ex_tower_04_17,6... PM.. together...
d_ex_tower_04_18,6... PM... together...
d_ex_tower_04_19,...
d_ex_tower_04_20,Arghhh...
d_ex_tower_04_21,I feel like I'm being suffocated... I can't take this!
d_ex_tower_04_22,Can't I just break something?
d_ex_tower_04_23,She's been like that for 30 minutes now.
d_ex_tower_04_24,She keeps glaring at her phone and mumbling something to herself. It sounds to me like she intends on coming after you.
d_ex_tower_04_25,"There's no doubt about it, this is a clue indicating where she intends to commit the murder!"
d_ex_tower_04_26,Guilty can't use her hands or feet because they're restrained.
d_ex_tower_04_27,So she uses voice-to-text on her phone.
d_ex_tower_04_28,And?
d_ex_tower_04_29,Have you ever considered she might simply be frustrated that her phone's voice recognition isn't working properly?
d_ex_tower_04_30,!!
d_ex_tower_04_31,Novel zooms in on the CCTV footage.
d_ex_tower_04_32,"I can see her phone screen. I think it says ""Go go, togeter have sex parade."""
d_ex_tower_04_33,"I think she tried to text ""Counselor, together at 6 PM""..."
d_ex_tower_04_34,That must be what's got her so fired up.
d_ex_tower_04_35,...
d_ex_tower_04_36,But this is far from the last suspicious activity I managed to capture of these sordid criminals.
d_ex_tower_04_37,"I give you, Exhibit B."
d_ex_tower_04_38,※※□Haha▣ha.
d_ex_tower_04_39,Agh!
d_ex_tower_04_40,"Stop! For the love of God, stop! The pain is too much, I can't take it!"
d_ex_tower_04_41,"※Ha※□Haha!! Come now, don't disappoint me!※□Can't you try and last a bit longer?"
d_ex_tower_04_42,"□▣▣After all, there's always a light※□※at the end of the tunnel."
d_ex_tower_04_43,I feel like I'm gonna die!
d_ex_tower_04_44,"Save me, Master!"
d_ex_tower_04_45,▣※□The Counselor can't help you now.
d_ex_tower_04_46,You are being far too※▣ dramatic. □□Minus 15 points□!!
d_ex_tower_04_47,End of recording.
d_ex_tower_04_48,...
d_ex_tower_04_49,What do you make of that?
d_ex_tower_04_50,"I don't care what angle you view that from,"
d_ex_tower_04_51,that is clearly two Nikkes being tortured.
d_ex_tower_04_52,And the yoga mats?
d_ex_tower_04_53,??
d_ex_tower_04_54,They all have yoga mats under them.
d_ex_tower_04_55,Ah-hah!
d_ex_tower_04_56,So they do.
d_ex_tower_04_57,What a dastardly villain! They even brought in yoga mats to try and cover up their sadistic torture methods!
d_ex_tower_04_58,You're way off base.
d_ex_tower_04_59,I think you might want to consider getting out of the detective racket.
d_ex_tower_04_60,I was just joking.
d_ex_tower_04_61,Perhaps my super sleuthing skills are a bit dull today.
d_ex_tower_04_62,I think I need to go out and hone them again.
d_ex_tower_04_63,...
d_ex_tower_04_64,"Until then, we'll rely on your senses, Watson."
d_ex_tower_04_65,Novel back-flips her way outside of the room
d_ex_tower_04_66,...
d_ex_tower_04_67,I'm now left alone. What should I do?
d_ex_tower_04_68,Watch Guilty's live security footage.
d_ex_tower_04_69,Watch Sin's live security footage.
d_ex_tower_04_70,Guilty is continuing to try and use voice recognition on her phone.
d_ex_tower_04_71,"Counselor, at 6 PM together..."
d_ex_tower_04_72,Counselor. Counselor.
d_ex_tower_04_73,"Ugh, it's not working. What should I do..."
d_ex_tower_04_74,...
d_ex_tower_04_75,"Counselor, are you watching?"
d_ex_tower_04_76,Quency told me something about an acupressure point on your body that feels great.
d_ex_tower_04_77,"I was wondering if you wanted to try it out together? I'll come over at 6 PM, so..."
d_ex_tower_04_78,Sin continues to punish Neon and Anis during her yoga class.
d_ex_tower_04_79,Aaagghh! Master! Maaaaster!
d_ex_tower_04_80,□□※▣Why do you keep calling for the □▣Counselor?
d_ex_tower_04_81,...
d_ex_tower_04_82,"□□※Even if anyone else is watching us※□, no one will be coming."
d_ex_tower_04_83,"However, Counselor,※▣※if you are watching, and you're interested,

d_ex_tower_04_84,▣And also...▣※why are you spying on me?! I haven't done anything wrong!
d_ex_tower_04_85,!!
d_ex_tower_04_86,*Click*
d_ex_tower_04_87,"Taken aback, I quickly turn off the live feed."
d_ex_tower_04_88,*Zing*
d_ex_tower_04_89,"Watson, you okay?"
d_ex_tower_04_90,Why is your face so white?
d_ex_tower_04_91,Did the culprit reveal themself while I was outside?!
d_ex_tower_04_92,I think we should put a stop to our surveillance.
d_ex_tower_04_93,What makes you say that?
d_ex_tower_04_94,I feel like we're being watched just as much.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_title,Crash Course in Cooking
d_ex_maidcafe_01_1,*Zing*
d_ex_maidcafe_01_2,"Hey, Commander."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_3,Master! I'm glad you're here.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_4,Welcome to my cooking class.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_5,Cooking class?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_6,That's right! I agreed to show Emma the ropes.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_7,Hopefully she can show me a few things.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_8,"I've never thought of it, but I was wanting to branch out with my recipes recently."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_9,Cocoa was gracious enough to offer to teach me.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_10,We invited you because we thought you'd make the perfect taste tester.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_11,"Is there anything you want to eat in particular, Master?"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_12,We'll try and make it for you.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_13,It feels like I have to tread cautiously as far as it concerns my recommendations.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_14,Ramen.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_15,Salad.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_16,"No way, that is too easy!"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_17,"This is a cooking class, after all."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_18,"Exactly, for a skilled maid, that's a piece of c... a piece of what?"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_19,A piece of cake.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_20,How about fried rice then?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_21,!!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_22,Fried rice is one of my favorites!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_23,That's a great suggestion.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_24,I've never made fried rice before.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_25,"In fact, I use it in one of my specialty dishes, Cocoa's Fried Rice of Love."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_26,Really? Can you teach me how to make it?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_27,"Sure I can! First things first, you need to wash your hands."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_28,Good cooking always starts with good hygiene.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_29,"A lot of oil goes into making this fried rice, which is why it tastes so good."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_30,Then mix some eggs in it...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_31,I was thinking...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_32,How about putting in some butter?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_33,It's bound to taste better with a few more ingredients added.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_34,Butter-fried rice?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_35,I can't say I've ever put butter into fried rice before.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_36,"Well, butter is delicious, so I'm sure it'll go great with it."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_37,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_38,"Okay, let's give it a whirl!"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_39,Life is all about trying new things.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_40,Words to live by!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_41,I first heard it from Ade.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_42,"Well, since we're adding butter, then how about some tomato?"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_43,I read somewhere that egg and tomato complement each other perfectly.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_44,"Sure! Tomatoes aren't too far off from ketchup, so I'm sure it'll be good."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_45,And then we can add...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_46,"Before long, it seems to turn into Emma's cooking class."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_47,A couple of hours later.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_48,*Splat* *Sppplat*
d_ex_maidcafe_01_49,Then you simply squirt the ketchup like this...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_50,and wah-lah!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_51,Wow!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_52,It looks wonderful.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_53,"*Sniff sniff* It definitely smells good, I'll say that much."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_54,It certainly took long enough.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_55,The fried rice that Emma and Cocoa have produced is a hodgepodge of various Splendamin flavors.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_56,"And now, for the official taste testing."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_57,...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_58,Eat it.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_59,Don't eat it.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_60,Cocoa and Emma are staring at me intently.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_61,I should probably eat it.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_62,"Well, down the hatch..."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_63,!!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_64,How is it? Is it good?
d_ex_maidcafe_01_65,"Considering how many delicious ingredients are in it, I can't see how it wouldn't taste good."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_66,Exactly! I even added my own specially-made ketchup.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_67,I can't imagine how it'd possibly taste bad.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_68,...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_69,My tongue hurts more and more with every bite. My whole body is beginning to ache.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_70,... But I feel obliged to eat it all.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_71,*Chomp chomp*
d_ex_maidcafe_01_72,"Whoa, you must really enjoy it, Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_01_73,Save some for us!
d_ex_maidcafe_01_74,Erp...
d_ex_maidcafe_01_75,It's... delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_76,"Do you mean it? This was my first time making it, but I guess it was a success!"
d_ex_maidcafe_01_77,You run one hell of a cooking class.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_78,You bet I do! I'm a top-tier maid.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_79,I'll definitely be back to learn more new dishes.
d_ex_maidcafe_01_80,"I need to find a bathroom, quickly."

d_ex_command_05_4,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_5,"Master, Master!"
d_ex_command_05_6,"The Maid Cafe isn't open today, so I don't have to tend to any customers."
d_ex_command_05_7,Waddya say we go there and play house?
d_ex_command_05_8,"I can be the Mom, and you can be the Dad."
d_ex_command_05_9,I'll make us a delicious omurice with ketchup.
d_ex_command_05_10,Will it at least have ingredients other than ketchup?
d_ex_command_05_11,"Sorry, I have a lot to do today."
d_ex_command_05_12,Of course it does.
d_ex_command_05_13,Ingredients so precious that they can't be found anywhere.
d_ex_command_05_14,"Sorry, I don't think I can. I have a lot to do today."
d_ex_command_05_15,It's okay.
d_ex_command_05_16,"Any maid worth her salt is good at waiting,"
d_ex_command_05_17,and that includes me.
d_ex_command_05_18,So you're willing to wait?
d_ex_command_05_19,"Sure, I'll go amuse myself outside for a bit."
d_ex_command_05_20,... Soon after.
d_ex_command_05_21,"Slowly but surely, I clear my work for the day.
I should probably call Cocoa..."
d_ex_command_05_22,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_23,Newbie. Got a job for you.
d_ex_command_05_24,HR wants you in charge of publicity for an upcoming government marketing event.
d_ex_command_05_25,"The event's in 3 days,"
d_ex_command_05_26,and the script is due tomorrow.
d_ex_command_05_27,That's not nearly enough time.
d_ex_command_05_28,Why would I be in charge of publicity for the Central Government?
d_ex_command_05_29,You think I don't know that?
d_ex_command_05_30,When have our superiors ever had any consideration for us?
d_ex_command_05_31,Do you have to ask?
d_ex_command_05_32,"Of all the commanders out there, you're the only one that's making a semblance of an impression."
d_ex_command_05_33,"Anyway, all the information you need is on this USB."
d_ex_command_05_34,I leave the rest in your hands.
d_ex_command_05_35,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_36,Back to the grind...
d_ex_command_05_37,"*Knock, knock*"
d_ex_command_05_38,"Master, what's our operation status? Over."
d_ex_command_05_39,"Please report, over."
d_ex_command_05_40,"Situation is looking bleak. You may have to pull out on your own, over."
d_ex_command_05_41,...
d_ex_command_05_42,It's okay.
d_ex_command_05_43,A true maid never leaves a comrade behind.
d_ex_command_05_44,I'll be at the back until your work is done.
d_ex_command_05_45,"Okay, I'll try and make it quick."
d_ex_command_05_46,... Soon after.
d_ex_command_05_47,I'm finally putting the finishing touches on the script. I should call Cocoa.
d_ex_command_05_48,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_49,"Client, got something for you."
d_ex_command_05_50,We've been ordered to provide a report detailing
d_ex_command_05_51,exactly how all the supplies entering the Outpost are being utilized.
d_ex_command_05_52,"I'm in charge of distribution, but I don't know what each and every last item is meant for."
d_ex_command_05_53,I was hoping you could help me write that down. Should be pretty common sense.
d_ex_command_05_54,When is it due?
d_ex_command_05_55,Yesterday.
d_ex_command_05_56,... Come again?
d_ex_command_05_57,"It was supposed to be turned in yesterday. But if we say it was done by a human, we can get away with being a day late."
d_ex_command_05_58,"On that note, if you could complete it by midnight, that'd be great."
d_ex_command_05_59,"Well, I'm off. I've got a meeting at Royal Road in an hour."
d_ex_command_05_60,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_61,... Another job has come up.
d_ex_command_05_62,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_63,"Master, give me a status report."
d_ex_command_05_64,It might be best if we give up for today.
d_ex_command_05_65,"Sorry, job keeps coming up."
d_ex_command_05_66,No.
d_ex_command_05_67,It's okay.
d_ex_command_05_68,I knew this would happen.
d_ex_command_05_69,"So, I brought along plenty of napkins and crayons."
d_ex_command_05_70,I'm going to make paper airplanes out of napkins and color them using crayons.
d_ex_command_05_71,"That way, the hours will fly by."
d_ex_command_05_72,If you say so. I'll try and wrap this up quickly.
d_ex_command_05_73,"Okay. Good luck, Master."
d_ex_command_05_74,... Soon after.
d_ex_command_05_75,"At long last, all of my work is complete."
d_ex_command_05_76,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_77,Commander. I have something to report.
d_ex_command_05_78,No.
d_ex_command_05_79,Sorry?
d_ex_command_05_80,I'm not working anymore today.
d_ex_command_05_81,??
d_ex_command_05_82,That's not what I came to tell you about.
d_ex_command_05_83,What is it then?
d_ex_command_05_84,Well...
d_ex_command_05_85,You should step outside for a moment.
d_ex_command_05_86,*Zing*
d_ex_command_05_87,"Out in the hallway, Cocoa is nestled amongst a veritable mountain of kaleidoscopic paper airplanes. She is fast asleep."
d_ex_command_05_88,Zzzz...
d_ex_command_05_89,Master and Cocoa...
d_ex_command_05_90,Cafe... airplane party...
d_ex_command_05_91,She's fast asleep.
d_ex_command_05_92,Sleeping like a baby.
d_ex_command_05_93,What should we do?
d_ex_command_05_94,"First things first, I'll take her home and put her to bed."
d_ex_command_05_95,"The next time the Maid Cafe is closed, let's take the day off."

d_ex_toyshop_05_1,Wowee!
d_ex_toyshop_05_2,"Master, why are there so many interesting toys here?"
d_ex_toyshop_05_3,"If they got into the wrong hands, like mine, they could be deadly weapons."
d_ex_toyshop_05_4,Fortunately there aren't many pros like you out there.
d_ex_toyshop_05_5,Toys aren't usually used in that way.
d_ex_toyshop_05_6,You're calling her a pro?
d_ex_toyshop_05_7,"I've yet to see a ""pro"" that plays with toys."
d_ex_toyshop_05_8,That's right.
d_ex_toyshop_05_9,Toys are made to play with.
d_ex_toyshop_05_10,Speak for yourself. I don't necessarily agree.
d_ex_toyshop_05_11,Are you the owner of this store?
d_ex_toyshop_05_12,"Yep, that's us."
d_ex_toyshop_05_13,"Is there anything you're looking for?
We'll help you find it."
d_ex_toyshop_05_14,Hmm...
d_ex_toyshop_05_15,I'm the head maid at the Maid Cafe near here.
d_ex_toyshop_05_16,I've noticed our customers seem to have a lot on their minds as of late.
d_ex_toyshop_05_17,I just want them to have a good time when they visit us. Are there any toys that would work for that?
d_ex_toyshop_05_18,Let me see...
d_ex_toyshop_05_19,Mica and Belorta stare at each other.
d_ex_toyshop_05_20,"How about roulette, where a bad spin nets you a punishment dished out by a Nikke?"
d_ex_toyshop_05_21,How about scratch-off tickets where the prize is a saucy picture of a maid?
d_ex_toyshop_05_22,... Gasp!
d_ex_toyshop_05_23,"Oh boy, that's a toughie."
d_ex_toyshop_05_24,Master. You pick for me.
d_ex_toyshop_05_25,"If it were me, I would choose the roulette game."
d_ex_toyshop_05_26,The scratch-off tickets sound more thrilling.
d_ex_toyshop_05_27,"Roulette, huh?"
d_ex_toyshop_05_28,Mwahahaha!
d_ex_toyshop_05_29,Now I shall tickle the feet of every customer in this cafe!
d_ex_toyshop_05_30,Nary a foot nor an armpit shall be safe!
d_ex_toyshop_05_31,"Agh! Help me, head maid!"
d_ex_toyshop_05_32,Wait just a moment.
d_ex_toyshop_05_33,A true maid determines the winner through roulette.
d_ex_toyshop_05_34,"You shall all spin the wheel, and whoever lands on this square,"
d_ex_toyshop_05_35,will be the first to be tickled mercilessly. How about it?
d_ex_toyshop_05_36,!!
d_ex_toyshop_05_37,!!
d_ex_toyshop_05_38,"Scratch-off tickets, huh?"
d_ex_toyshop_05_39,Hehehe...
d_ex_toyshop_05_40,My name is Jonathan. My occupation: Stalker.
d_ex_toyshop_05_41,I will take a picture of all the maids here at this store.
d_ex_toyshop_05_42,My mission: To make all of you look as bad as possible!
d_ex_toyshop_05_43,You monster! How could you be so cruel?!
d_ex_toyshop_05_44,"Help us, Cocoa!"
d_ex_toyshop_05_45,Wait just a moment.
d_ex_toyshop_05_46,A true maid uses scratch-off tickets to determine whether or not weirdo stalkers can take unflattering pictures.
d_ex_toyshop_05_47,The person who picks the winning scratch-off gets to take a photo with Soda.
d_ex_toyshop_05_48,How about it?
d_ex_toyshop_05_49,!!
d_ex_toyshop_05_50,...
d_ex_toyshop_05_51,Seems like you have quite an active imagination.
d_ex_toyshop_05_52,I think it's a good idea.
d_ex_toyshop_05_53,"I can fight valiantly against the villains,"
d_ex_toyshop_05_54,and the customers can have fun watching.
d_ex_toyshop_05_55,"Uh... Not exactly sure I get what you mean, but I'll get that wrapped up for you."
d_ex_toyshop_05_56,Any other toys you're interested in? Feel free to browse.
d_ex_toyshop_05_57,Hm...
d_ex_toyshop_05_58,Hmmmmm...
d_ex_toyshop_05_59,What is that funny-looking orange slipper?
d_ex_toyshop_05_60,I can see that you have good taste! That's a slipper meant to look like a fish.
d_ex_toyshop_05_61,What kind of fish was it again... was it carp?
d_ex_toyshop_05_62,"No, I think it was a shark."
d_ex_toyshop_05_63,"What? They're quite different, aren't they?"
d_ex_toyshop_05_64,"Anyway, it's a fish that lives in the sea."
d_ex_toyshop_05_65,"In similar fashion, we've also got a squid mask and an octopus suction-cup plush."
d_ex_toyshop_05_66,...
d_ex_toyshop_05_67,"Wow! Cocoa, what are these? They're so cool!"
d_ex_toyshop_05_68,They seem to be mimicking different forms of marine life.
d_ex_toyshop_05_69,"That's awesome! You're amazing, Cocoa."
d_ex_toyshop_05_70,"The ocean, and naturally all marine life, only exists on the surface."
d_ex_toyshop_05_71,"But you've managed to bring a taste of that to the Ark. You're truly a genius, Cocoa."
d_ex_toyshop_05_72,Hehe!
d_ex_toyshop_05_73,I'll take this as well.
d_ex_toyshop_05_74,What was running through your mind this time around?
d_ex_toyshop_05_75,I assure you it was strictly professional.
d_ex_toyshop_05_76,Something completely outside the realm of possibility for an amateur.
d_ex_toyshop_05_77,...
d_ex_toyshop_05_78,"Cocoa spends the rest of the day scurrying around the toy store, lost in her imagination."
d_ex_toyshop_05_79,"Before the day is out, she has spent her entire month's stipend."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_title,The Flavors of Maid Cafe
d_ex_maidcafe_02_1,*Zing*
d_ex_maidcafe_02_2,"Oh, hey Trainer!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_3,"Welcome, Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_4,Biscuit? What are you doing at the Maid Cafe?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_5,Well...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_6,"Coffee doesn't really agree with me,"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_7,so I don't frequent cafes all that often.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_8,"Cocoa told me that the Maid Cafe was different though, and that I should stop by sometime."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_9,"That's right, this place is unlike any other Cafe."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_10,We've got plenty of things that you can eat.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_11,What are you planning on suggesting?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_12,Cocoa.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_13,... You?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_14,"No, the drink!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_15,"A nice cup of hot, slurptastic cocoa."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_16,That doesn't exactly sound appetizing...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_17,It doesn't?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_18,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_19,I've got it!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_20,What if I make it cold?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_21,Not making it any better.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_22,No?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_23,Why not?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_24,"Wait a sec, doesn't hot cocoa have chocolate in it?"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_25,"Oh yeah, bunches!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_26,... I figured as much.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_27,A cup of cocoa won't work for Biscuit either.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_28,Why not? Hot cocoa doesn't have any coffee in it.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_29,"You're right, but there's something else it has in common with cocoa: caffeine."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_30,Biscuit can't have caffeine.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_31,No kidding...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_32,I had no idea.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_33,But I promised Biscuit that we'd have something here she could eat.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_34,What if I can't come up with anything?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_35,Surely you can make something other than hot cocoa?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_36,"Come on, you're a professional maid. You can do this."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_37,Let me think...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_38,Let me think...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_39,!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_40,I know now.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_41,I'll have Ade make you some omurice.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_42,Omurice?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_43,Yup! We can even use the ketchup to draw some cute doggies on top.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_44,I'm sure I can pull that off with no problem.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_45,"Erm, about ketchup..."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_46,She can't have ketchup eit...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_47,"Extra ketchup, got it!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_48,"No, that's not it..."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_49,You wait right here. I'll have it ready in a jiffy.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_50,Cocoa rushes into the kitchen to look for Ade.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_51,Oh boy... what should I do?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_52,I can't have ketchup.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_53,Let's just wait for now.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_54,Soon after.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_55,Cocoa brings out the omurice made by Ade.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_56,"Wow, it looks delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_57,As it should! Nobody makes better omurice than Ade.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_58,"I told her it was a special order for Biscuit, and she removed the salty."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_59,... Did you mean to say salt?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_60,"Oh yeah, that. I think that's what she said."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_61,Thank you for being so considerate.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_62,Now's the part where I come in.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_63,I'll draw a cute little dog for you.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_64,Cocoa produces a ketchup bottle.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_65,"Cocoa, stop!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_66,Huh?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_67,Actually... Biscuit can't have ketchup either.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_68,!!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_69,Really?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_70,... Yes. I'm sorry.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_71,But if ketchup isn't allowed either...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_72,then I can't do anything...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_73,...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_74,...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_75,Go ahead and put it on. I'll eat the parts with the ketchup.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_76,!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_77,I can describe how it tastes to Biscuit.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_78,"Yeah, Trainer will eat those parts on my behalf!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_79,I can eat the portions that don't have any ketchup.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_80,"That way, there will still be something that I can eat here."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_81,Is that okay?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_82,You won't be disappointed?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_83,"It may not be perfect... but it's okay. Trainer will be eating the parts I can't, so nothing will go to waste."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_84,Well...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_85,"Okay. In that case, I'll use the same amount of ketchup I usually give Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_86,"Wait, that's not necessary..."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_87,Go ahead!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_88,*Squirt* *Squirt*
d_ex_maidcafe_02_89,"*Sqquirt* *Shoot*
*Pfff* *Sqqqquuiirrtt*"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_90,There you go!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_91,"Cocoa pushes forward the omurice, freshly adorned with ketchup."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_92,*Gasp*
d_ex_maidcafe_02_93,On top of the omurice is a gargantuan pile of ketchup that has nearly consumed the entire dish.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_94,What should be a dog pattern instead appears to be...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_95,"Erm, the dog..."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_96,Appears to be suffering from a massive hemorrhage.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_97,Seems to be vomiting ketchup in gross quantities.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_98,??
d_ex_maidcafe_02_99,"That's not blood, silly. It's ketchup."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_100,??
d_ex_maidcafe_02_101,"That's not vomit, silly. It's ketchup."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_102,"Now, here you go!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_103,Cocoa pushes the plate of omurice forward. It is more ketchup than rice at this point.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_104,...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_105,Trainer...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_106,I lift up a spoonful of the omurice with shaking hands.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_107,... Are you okay?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_108,Want to try some?
d_ex_maidcafe_02_109,"Oh, um... sure!"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_110,I somehow find a part without any ketchup and feed it to Biscuit.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_111,!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_112,"What do you think? Pretty delicious, right?"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_113,It's fantastic!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_114,"You can tell you used fresh ingredients, and it's not too salty, so it's perfect for me."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_115,There you have it!
d_ex_maidcafe_02_116,"That right there, is the special taste of omurice made by professional maids."
d_ex_maidcafe_02_117,"Isn't that right, Master?"
d_ex_maidcafe_02_118,... Yup.
d_ex_maidcafe_02_119,All I can taste is ketchup...
d_ex_maidcafe_02_120,Biscuit and I will have to visit the Maid Cafe again when Cocoa isn't working.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_title,New Playthings
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_1,Aaahhhh!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_2,Biscuit stretches out her arms.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_3,I'm loving this weather!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_4,Nothing beats a stroll on a nice day.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_5,But you like going on walks even when the weather is terrible.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_6,"True, but..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_7,It's obviously nicer when the weather is agreeable. Hee hee.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_8,"Hey, Commander."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_9,And Biscuit?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_10,Yuni. Mihara.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_11,Hi.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_12,Hello!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_13,We were just going for a walk since the weather is so nice.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_14,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_15,Just enjoying a short perambulation as well.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_16,"Unfortunately, I forgot to take a few things, so that's been bothering me."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_17,"Sorry, I should have paid more attention and prepared them beforehand."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_18,Don't worry.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_19,The reason we got all flummoxed is that I said I wanted to try a new route.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_20,What did you forget to bring?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_21,"Oh you know, just some basic essentials."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_22,"A leash, stuff like that."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_23,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_24,You're so right!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_25,"Before you go on a walk,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_26,you've got to be sure to pack a few things.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_27,"A leash, like you said,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_28,"some snacks to eat when they get hungry, a ball to play catch with..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_29,You're right.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_30,We totally forgot about snacks and playthings.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_31,We hadn't even considered those...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_32,This is a brave new frontier for us!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_33,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_34,"Yes, very new indeed."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_35,We have to prepare different items for different walks.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_36,I guess we didn't think about that.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_37,"Yuni, should we go shopping?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_38,"Yes, let's. I want to try something new."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_39,I'm going to buy a bunch of snacks! And toys!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_40,"Sure, we'll see what's out there."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_41,Heehee!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_42,"Well, we've got some shopping to do."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_43,You two have fun.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_44,You too.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_45,Yuni and Mihara leave excitedly.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_46,"Wow, they certainly seemed excited."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_47,Those two must really be into pets.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_48,I'm pretty sure!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_49,"... Sure, that's it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_50,Do you think it's for a dog or a cat?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_51,"Oh right, they said they were going for a walk,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_52,so it must be a dog.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_53,... Couldn't say.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_54,I heard that Missilis is practically draconian with their Nikkes.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_55,Hard to imagine that they'd let them keep pets...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_56,Shows what I know!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_57,Something tells me they don't have any pets.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_58,Huh?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_59,What were they buying all those items for then?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_60,They're intending on using them for something... special.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_61,Best not to ask too many questions.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_62,Something special?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_63,What? Something seems off...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_64,Let's just finish our walk
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_65,and enjoy the nice weather.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_66,Oh... okay.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_05_67,Biscuit and I continue along our walk past the Goddess of Victory statue.
d_ex_hospital_05_title,Animal and Hospital
d_ex_hospital_05_1,I'm sure... must... concerned.
d_ex_hospital_05_2,What... I do?
d_ex_hospital_05_3,??
d_ex_hospital_05_4,"Upon arriving at the hospital, I see Mary and Biscuit talking in the hallway."
d_ex_hospital_05_5,Hi.
d_ex_hospital_05_6,What are you doing?
d_ex_hospital_05_7,"Oh, Trainer!"
d_ex_hospital_05_8,Commander? What brings you to the hospital?
d_ex_hospital_05_9,I came to see Mary.
d_ex_hospital_05_10,I came to see Biscuit.
d_ex_hospital_05_11,You came to see me?
d_ex_hospital_05_12,Are you hurt?
d_ex_hospital_05_13,Me? How did you know I was here?
d_ex_hospital_05_14,"You don't have psychic abilities, do you?!"
d_ex_hospital_05_15,I was just stopping by.
d_ex_hospital_05_16,"Ah, I see."
d_ex_hospital_05_17,"What are you doing here, Biscuit?"
d_ex_hospital_05_18,I was asking Mary for advice on how not to be afraid of hospitals.
d_ex_hospital_05_19,"A few days from now, Max and other puppers are coming in for a checkup."
d_ex_hospital_05_20,"The only thing is, they keeps freaking out whenever I so much as mention the word ""hospital""."
d_ex_hospital_05_21,"Only yesterday, I said it while talking with Nero,"
d_ex_hospital_05_22,and she ran for cover as soon as he heard it.
d_ex_hospital_05_23,So I came to ask Mary for some advice.
d_ex_hospital_05_24,But this isn't an animal hospital...
d_ex_hospital_05_25,"Sure, but Mary is still a doctor."
d_ex_hospital_05_26,... All right then.
d_ex_hospital_05_27,"Well, did you make any headway?"
d_ex_hospital_05_28,Not yet. We just started discussing it.
d_ex_hospital_05_29,"Do you have any suggestions, Commander?"
d_ex_hospital_05_30,Hmm...
d_ex_hospital_05_31,How about blindfolding them before setting out?
d_ex_hospital_05_32,How about putting them inside a carrier cage beforehand?
d_ex_hospital_05_33,I doubt doggos would appreciate being blindfolded.
d_ex_hospital_05_34,"Besides, not being able to see would only make them more nervous."
d_ex_hospital_05_35,Then how about putting them inside a carrier cage?
d_ex_hospital_05_36,"It makes sense on paper, but"
d_ex_hospital_05_37,"the instant I take out the cage, they just tear it to shreds."
d_ex_hospital_05_38,...
d_ex_hospital_05_39,Sounds to me like our only option is repetitive training.
d_ex_hospital_05_40,We need to get them to develop positive memories of hospitals.
d_ex_hospital_05_41,Repetitive training?
d_ex_hospital_05_42,"Precisely. Dogs tend to associate hospitals with bad memories, so they naturally don't want to return."
d_ex_hospital_05_43,"So, how about every time you come to the hospital, you give them a treat or some kind of reward?"
d_ex_hospital_05_44,"That way, they'll start to associate going to the hospital with positive feelings."
d_ex_hospital_05_45,We do the same thing with children who are reluctant about hospital visits.
d_ex_hospital_05_46,"At first, they cry and protest about how they don't want to come, but once we show them a fun cartoon or give them some candy,"
d_ex_hospital_05_47,they don't mind coming to the hospital so much.
d_ex_hospital_05_48,But I don't have time to take doggos to the vet every day.
d_ex_hospital_05_49,How about using our hospital?
d_ex_hospital_05_50,Come by this way whenever you're taking him for a walk.
d_ex_hospital_05_51,Slowly break him into it by letting him smell the hospital and get used to its atmosphere.
d_ex_hospital_05_52,Are you sure I can do that?
d_ex_hospital_05_53,It's okay as long as you don't let them run wild in the hospital rooms.
d_ex_hospital_05_54,Hmm...
d_ex_hospital_05_55,Kind of like a trial run!
d_ex_hospital_05_56,Why don't you try it out now?
d_ex_hospital_05_57,Are you sure?
d_ex_hospital_05_58,"Actually, I just took Max for a walk, and he is already waiting outside..."
d_ex_hospital_05_59,All right!
d_ex_hospital_05_60,Let's give it a shot!
d_ex_hospital_05_61,Sounds good.
d_ex_hospital_05_62,Soon after.
d_ex_hospital_05_63,*Zing*
d_ex_hospital_05_64,*Whine*
d_ex_hospital_05_65,*Whine* *Whine*
d_ex_hospital_05_66,Max stands frozen at the entrance of the hospital and refuses to budge an inch.
d_ex_hospital_05_67,"C'mon, Max! Just a few steps. Go over to Mary, and I'll give you a treat."
d_ex_hospital_05_68,... *Whine*
d_ex_hospital_05_69,"Oh, what a handsome boy you are! Come here, Max."
d_ex_hospital_05_70,"Mary starts to make her way towards Max, when..."
d_ex_hospital_05_71,*Ruff ruff*
d_ex_hospital_05_72,Max!
d_ex_hospital_05_73,*Ta-da-dak*
d_ex_hospital_05_74,*Ruff ruff ruff*
d_ex_hospital_05_75,A frantic Max bolts out of the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_05_76,"Max, come back! I'll give you some tasty kibble later, I promise!"
d_ex_hospital_05_77,...
d_ex_hospital_05_78,I'm sorry! I've got to go catch Max!
d_ex_hospital_05_79,"Sure. The hospital is always open, so feel free to drop by later if you need any help."
d_ex_hospital_05_80,Yes! Thank you!
d_ex_hospital_05_81,Max! Come back!
d_ex_hospital_05_82,Biscuit runs after Max.
d_ex_hospital_05_83,Hmm...
d_ex_hospital_05_84,I suppose hospitals can be scary for animals as well as humans.
d_ex_hospital_05_85,"Yeah, I find them pretty scary as well."
d_ex_hospital_05_86,I don't find them scary.
d_ex_hospital_05_87,"Oh, really?"
d_ex_hospital_05_88,"Well, since you're here, why don't we do an examination?"
d_ex_hospital_05_89,... Huh?
d_ex_hospital_05_90,Hasn't it been a while since your last physical?
d_ex_hospital_05_91,Yes...
d_ex_hospital_05_92,Let's get started then! I'll be with you in a moment.
d_ex_hospital_05_93,... Thanks.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_title,New Customer
d_ex_maidcafe_03_1,*Ring*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_2,Welcome!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_3,Aagh! So hot! I'm burning up!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_4,Folkwang?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_5,Coach?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_6,What brings you to the Maid Cafe?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_7,Just hanging out.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_8,I was going to ask you the same question.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_9,"Oh, I see..."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_10,"It's sweltering out there, so I just chose a random place to beat the heat."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_11,Turns out that it's hot in here as well...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_12,Is the air conditioning working?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_13,"It's not that warm today, so we didn't turn it on."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_14,Gah! No wonder it's like a sauna in here.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_15,"Any chance you can turn it on? And set it to below zero, please and thank you."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_16,I don't think air conditioners can go that low.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_17,The other customers will be freezing.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_18,"Fine, then just set it to as low as it can go."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_19,I still think that'll make the other customers a bit too cold...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_20,"All right, all right."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_21,Guess I'll have to go somewhere else.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_22,"Before you go, can I offer you a cup of ice water?"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_23,You bet you can! That's very kind of you.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_24,I'm so hot that I can barely move.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_25,Coming right up!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_26,After a while.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_27,Here's your water.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_28,*Thud*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_29,Whoops!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_30,*Clank clank*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_31,*Swoosh*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_32,Soda walks into a table and trips while serving Folkwang.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_33,The entire cup of water splashes onto Folkwang.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_34,Soda! Are you all right?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_35,Folkwang! Are you all right?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_36,I'm fine..
d_ex_maidcafe_03_37,"Folkwang, what about you?"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_38,Ah...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_39,I'm sorry!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_40,That... felt great!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_41,??
d_ex_maidcafe_03_42,It felt like heaven when that iced water splashed all over me.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_43,"Thanks to you, I don't feel like I'm dying of heatstroke anymore."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_44,I should apologize anyway...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_45,Forget about it! I was already drenched in sweat anyway.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_46,"Guess you lucked out this time, Soda."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_47,I'd say so.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_48,I better stay here until I dry off.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_49,Got anything else that's cool and refreshing?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_50,Like say... ice cream? Or shaved ice?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_51,Are you hungry? How about I get you some chilled desserts?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_52,That sounds perfect.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_53,"I'll get one for Master, too! Wait right here."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_54,After a while.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_55,"One refreshing parfait slush, coming right up!"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_56,"The bottom is ice-cold slushie, and on top, we've got a big ol' scoop of ice cream."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_57,"If it tastes as good as it looks, we're in for a treat."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_58,*Slurp*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_59,Have a taste before it melts.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_60,"It looks fantastic, thanks!"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_61,Thanks.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_62,*Nom nom*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_63,...!!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_64,The ice-cold parfait slush is incredible. It's so cold that it makes my teeth hurt.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_65,Holy moly! It's like I'm eating ice cream in the middle of the Antarctic.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_66,*Chew*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_67,*Chew chew*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_68,Folkwang wolfs down the dessert.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_69,Say Coach... are you gonna finish yours?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_70,"Don't worry, I'll get you more. Just a moment."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_71,I can't believe how happy this made me! It's been ages since I had chilled dessert like that. I feel so good I could cry.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_72,Aren't you being a bit dramatic?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_73,"One more parfait slush, coming ri..."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_74,*Thud*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_75,*Crush*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_76,Oh no! I'm so sorry! I'll clean it up right away!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_77,My face is... so cold! It feels amazing.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_78,...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_79,Later.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_80,Oof... so full... so cool... have I died and gone to heaven?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_81,"Having said that, I know in a little while, I'll be just as hot as I was before."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_82,Would you like me to bring you an ice compress?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_83,A what?
d_ex_maidcafe_03_84,"An ice compress, so you can keep your face cooler for longer."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_85,"Oh, neato! Thanks a bunch."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_86,I'll go get some ice cubes and put them into an ice bag.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_87,"Man, this place is the best, isn't it?"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_88,Here's your ice bag!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_89,Whoa!
d_ex_maidcafe_03_90,*Crush*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_91,*Swoosh*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_92,The ice cubes fly out of the bag and land on Folkwang.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_93,... *Sigh*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_94,I see you're rather prone to accidents.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_95,It's okay if you're mad at me...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_96,Are you kidding? I'm grateful! I haven't felt this cool in my entire life.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_97,"Um... you're welcome? I'll bring you more, then."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_98,...
d_ex_maidcafe_03_99,Later.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_100,*Clank*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_101,Ahh... that hits the spot.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_102,*Clank clank*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_103,"Yep, that's the ticket..."
d_ex_maidcafe_03_104,*Clank clank*
d_ex_maidcafe_03_105,"Whoops, sorry!"
d_ex_maidcafe_03_106,Soda keeps making mistake after mistake.
d_ex_maidcafe_03_107,I sneak out of the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_tower_05_title,Beginner's Luck?
d_ex_tower_05_1,"Hey Exia, Soda! What are you two up to?"
d_ex_tower_05_2,We're playing some games together.
d_ex_tower_05_3,About that...
d_ex_tower_05_4,"Novel invited me over to help her with some cleaning,"
d_ex_tower_05_5,but Exia won't let me.
d_ex_tower_05_6,"If she wants to clean up this room,"
d_ex_tower_05_7,she'll have to beat me first.
d_ex_tower_05_8,Exia is so bossy.
d_ex_tower_05_9,I've never played a video game before.
d_ex_tower_05_10,"Exia, you're being ridiculous."
d_ex_tower_05_11,"Please. If anything, I'm merely preventing this clumsy oaf"
d_ex_tower_05_12,from destroying my precious game console.
d_ex_tower_05_13,What game are you playing?
d_ex_tower_05_14,Iron Punch.
d_ex_tower_05_15,A classic fighting game.
d_ex_tower_05_16,"If you're skilled enough, you can pound your opponent into the dirt,"
d_ex_tower_05_17,so it's the best game to determine a clear winner and loser.
d_ex_tower_05_18,You only say that because you're confident you won't lose.
d_ex_tower_05_19,*Sob* Exactly...
d_ex_tower_05_20,"Nothing is certain. Remember, we have to account for beginner's luck."
d_ex_tower_05_21,A while later.
d_ex_tower_05_22,*Ba ba ba* *Ba ba* *Ba ba*
d_ex_tower_05_23,"The words ""YOU LOSE"" appears on Exia's screen."
d_ex_tower_05_24,!!!
d_ex_tower_05_25,!!!
d_ex_tower_05_26,Er... Is it over?
d_ex_tower_05_27,Impossible... I... I lost...
d_ex_tower_05_28,"Wow Soda, you're a natural at video games!"
d_ex_tower_05_29,You beat Exia! That's amazing!
d_ex_tower_05_30,"Oh, I won?"
d_ex_tower_05_31,I can't believe this! I lost to a complete noob who can't even tell that she won.
d_ex_tower_05_32,This can't be happening.
d_ex_tower_05_33,"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll win later on!"
d_ex_tower_05_34,You didn't make a single mistake the entire time. How did you do it?
d_ex_tower_05_35,I didn't?
d_ex_tower_05_36,I was just randomly pressing buttons.
d_ex_tower_05_37,!!!
d_ex_tower_05_38,"You didn't have a clue what buttons to press, but I lost? Me?!"
d_ex_tower_05_39,"Hee hee, I won!"
d_ex_tower_05_40,"Anyway, can I start cleaning now?"
d_ex_tower_05_41,Not yet! Let's make it best of three.
d_ex_tower_05_42,Huh? You want to keep playing?
d_ex_tower_05_43,"If you refuse, you'll leave a customer dissatisfied."
d_ex_tower_05_44,?!
d_ex_tower_05_45,What kind of maid would that make you then?
d_ex_tower_05_46,Eeeek!
d_ex_tower_05_47,"That's a cruel trick, Exia."
d_ex_tower_05_48,Looks like you found her weakness.
d_ex_tower_05_49,"You're right, a maid should always leave the customer satisfied."
d_ex_tower_05_50,"Very well, let's play again."
d_ex_tower_05_51,Excellent.
d_ex_tower_05_52,Another round!
d_ex_tower_05_53,...
d_ex_tower_05_54,However...
d_ex_tower_05_55,"No matter how many rounds they play, Exia loses to Soda every single time."
d_ex_tower_05_56,Impossible. This is impossible! How can I lose every single time?!
d_ex_tower_05_57,"I'm the champion! I'm undefeatable, and I keep being bested by someone who can't tell a joystick from a shoulder button!"
d_ex_tower_05_58,ARRRGGGHH!
d_ex_tower_05_59,"Well, I better start cleaning up!"
d_ex_tower_05_60,*Whoosh* *Bang*
d_ex_tower_05_61,Wham! Sorry!
d_ex_tower_05_62,I better start cleani... oh no!
d_ex_tower_05_63,*Clank* *Rip*
d_ex_tower_05_64,"By the time Soda is finished cleaning, 3 of Exia's game consoles have been totaled."
d_ex_tower_05_65,...
d_ex_tower_05_66,My consoles! And my pride...
d_ex_tower_05_67,It can't end like this!
d_ex_tower_05_68,I demand a rematch!
d_ex_tower_05_69,Are you sure? I've already finished all the cleaning.
d_ex_tower_05_70,What kind of maid would drag a customer's pride through the dirt?
d_ex_tower_05_71,What?! I would never do such a thing!
d_ex_tower_05_72,"Very well, another round!"
d_ex_tower_05_73,A moment later...
d_ex_tower_05_74,K.O!
d_ex_tower_05_75,"""YOU LOSE!"" shows up on Soda's screen."
d_ex_tower_05_76,"Darn, I lost again."
d_ex_tower_05_77,"That's 100 wins for me, and 3 for you."
d_ex_tower_05_78,How come I'm winning so easily...?
d_ex_tower_05_79,What's going on here?
d_ex_tower_05_80,I was doing fine not long ago. What's this drastic change?
d_ex_tower_05_81,"Beginner's luck, I guess."
d_ex_tower_05_82,...
d_ex_tower_05_83,Exia decides not to play any more fighting games with novices for a while.
d_ex_police_05_title,Cleaning Trip!
d_ex_police_05_1,*Zing*
d_ex_police_05_2,"Hey, Commander."
d_ex_police_05_3,You're just in time.
d_ex_police_05_4,Why is that you called me out here?
d_ex_police_05_5,"We wanted to clean up the police station today, and I was afraid we would be short of hands."
d_ex_police_05_6,"Yeah, this place is super dusty."
d_ex_police_05_7,"Forget crime fighting, today we're dust fighting!"
d_ex_police_05_8,...
d_ex_police_05_9,...
d_ex_police_05_10,...
d_ex_police_05_11,"Soda, reporting for duty!"
d_ex_police_05_12,Soda?
d_ex_police_05_13,Master?
d_ex_police_05_14,"Hey there, Soda."
d_ex_police_05_15,Thanks for taking the time to help us out.
d_ex_police_05_16,Is Soda going to be cleaning with us?
d_ex_police_05_17,"Yep! She's got such a knack for cleaning, I figured I'd ask her to come and help."
d_ex_police_05_18,All we've got to do is follow her orders.
d_ex_police_05_19,You put her in charge?
d_ex_police_05_20,I can't believe what I'm hearing.
d_ex_police_05_21,Huh? What'd you say?
d_ex_police_05_22,"Speak up, I can't hear you."
d_ex_police_05_23,I said she's super reliable.
d_ex_police_05_24,Leave it to me!
d_ex_police_05_25,We'll have this place as clean as a whistle!
d_ex_police_05_26,Where should we start?
d_ex_police_05_27,"First things first, we should open a window to let in some fresh air."
d_ex_police_05_28,I'm on it!
d_ex_police_05_29,"Wait, let me put all these documents away first!"
d_ex_police_05_30,*Swoosh*
d_ex_police_05_31,*Splish-splash*
d_ex_police_05_32,Miranda opens the window before Poli finishes talking. The documents atop Poli's desk go flying.
d_ex_police_05_33,Would you close that window?!
d_ex_police_05_34,*Swoosh* *Slap*
d_ex_police_05_35,"Oh no! I'm sorry, Poli! I didn't notice the documents lying there."
d_ex_police_05_36,Oh boy...
d_ex_police_05_37,I guess I should have made sure everything was okay before issuing any commands. I'm sorry...
d_ex_police_05_38,It's... it's okay. I should have packed everything up beforehand.
d_ex_police_05_39,Can you help me pick up the documents?
d_ex_police_05_40,Sure.
d_ex_police_05_41,I know better now!
d_ex_police_05_42,*Clank*
d_ex_police_05_43,*Swoosh*
d_ex_police_05_44,!!
d_ex_police_05_45,Whoa!
d_ex_police_05_46,*Clank clank*
d_ex_police_05_47,Whoa! Are you okay?
d_ex_police_05_48,*Clank clank*
d_ex_police_05_49,Soda trips over a cleaning basket as she attempts to pick up some documents.
d_ex_police_05_50,"Miranda goes to help Soda, but slips on a puddle of cleaning detergent and faceplants."
d_ex_police_05_51,...
d_ex_police_05_52,*Sigh*
d_ex_police_05_53,Leave the documents to the Commander and I.
d_ex_police_05_54,"Miranda and Soda, you can go clean up somewhere else."
d_ex_police_05_55,Sorry about that...
d_ex_police_05_56,Not a promising start.
d_ex_police_05_57,"Wow, what is this for?"
d_ex_police_05_58,That's a scraper. It's a kind of cleaning tool.
d_ex_police_05_59,You can use it to get off all kinds of muck on walls and windows.
d_ex_police_05_60,Like here for example. Look at all this gunk.
d_ex_police_05_61,All we've got to do is use the scraper to...
d_ex_police_05_62,*Rip*
d_ex_police_05_63,...
d_ex_police_05_64,...
d_ex_police_05_65,...
d_ex_police_05_66,...
d_ex_police_05_67,Soda accidently tears a nearby map while scraping gunk off a wall.
d_ex_police_05_68,The map of the Ark! You practically tore it in half!
d_ex_police_05_69,I-I'm sorry! I'll stick it back together.
d_ex_police_05_70,"I can just use a feather duster to clean here, right Soda?"
d_ex_police_05_71,Yep! Just brush it gently.
d_ex_police_05_72,Okay. Gently...
d_ex_police_05_73,*Clank clank*
d_ex_police_05_74,...
d_ex_police_05_75,...
d_ex_police_05_76,...
d_ex_police_05_77,...
d_ex_police_05_78,Miranda knocks over a photo frame as she is dusting the wall.
d_ex_police_05_79,"You're supposed to brush off the dust, not smash our photo frames!"
d_ex_police_05_80,Sorry!
d_ex_police_05_81,"Between the two of you, it's been one mishap after another."
d_ex_police_05_82,This is starting to get out of hand.
d_ex_police_05_83,... *Sigh*
d_ex_police_05_84,Miranda.
d_ex_police_05_85,Soda.
d_ex_police_05_86,Can you go clean the detention cell windows?
d_ex_police_05_87,Sure thing!
d_ex_police_05_88,I'll do my best!
d_ex_police_05_89,Miranda and Soda head towards the detention cell.
d_ex_police_05_90,*Squeak* *Bang*
d_ex_police_05_91,*Click*
d_ex_police_05_92,??
d_ex_police_05_93,??
d_ex_police_05_94,??
d_ex_police_05_95,You two are being detained for the crime of interfering with cleaning affairs.
d_ex_police_05_96,Your sentence: remain in this cell until the Commander and I are finished with the cleaning.
d_ex_police_05_97,Commander.
d_ex_police_05_98,Let's go.
d_ex_police_05_99,*Whimper* N-not fair!
d_ex_police_05_100,Poli!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_title,Big O vs. Organization
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_1,"You're right on time, Partner."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_2,Tonight is the night when the red moon rises and shines over the Surface's abyss.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_3,The time has finally come for us to punish the Big O.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_4,And it's all thanks to this sacred book...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_5,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_6,"Wait, who's this with you? She's a Nikke, isn't she?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_7,She's Seimeikai's...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_8,She's the Queen of the Underworld's...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_9,I'm Sakura.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_10,{AccountData.NickName}-kun and I happen to be on a mission together.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_11,What you just said struck me as rather curious.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_12,Are you... trying to exact vengeance on a certain organization?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_13,!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_14,Yes.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_15,Partner and I have come here for a purpose.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_16,We shall harness the power of the sacred book to inflict destruction upon those who are guilty.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_17,"Together, we shall bring order to this filthy cesspool of a world."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_18,Order?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_19,"Yes, Sacred Order, to be precise."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_20,"Do you want in? If you do, you picked the perfect time."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_21,"If you had tried earlier, you'd have needed 5 registered members to vouch for you."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_22,"We can make an exception for now, though. You've got Partner and I's seal of approval, and that will suffice."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_23,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_24,"I'm not sure how to put this, but..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_25,You haven't told me enough for me to feel comfortable joining you just yet.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_26,"You could at least tell me the name of the organization you keep referring to,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_27,and the crimes they've committed.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_28,"Oh, that... erm... that may be a bit of an issue."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_29,A most heinous and powerful injunction has been inflicted upon me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_30,It prevents me from telling anyone the truth about the Big O.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_31,"Ah, so that's it!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_32,The opposing organization has you under a non-disclosure agreement.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_33,I get it now.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_34,Controlling information is always one of the main focuses for any organization once they start to scale up.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_35,This is like watching a conversation between two people in two different languages.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_36,This is like watching the blind lead the blind. Very funny.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_37,"Far from it, Partner."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_38,"I assure you, we are very much on the same page. Down to the letter, in fact."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_39,??
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_40,What a bizarre statement.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_41,... It's nothing. Pretend I never said anything.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_42,"Sakura,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_43,"while I cannot reveal too much,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_44,one thing is certain.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_45,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_46,The Big O
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_47,was birthed in a bed of oppression
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_48,and raised in the cradle of discrimination.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_49,"In the end, it will devour its own bitter fruit and be entombed in the catacombs we call disillusionment."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_50,The Big O is the embodiment of all that is evil in this world.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_51,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_52,"Oh, you mean Ahriman?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_53,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_54,you're spouting out strange things again.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_55,I was just trying to get in the spirit of things.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_56,You asked me what crimes the organization has committed.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_57,I don't need to answer that question.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_58,Why? you ask?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_59,Because all the crimes in the entire world are committed by the Big O!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_60,"Slaughter, oppression, discrimination, exploitation, and all manner of other unspeakable atrocities."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_61,"If I were to list them all, my heart couldn't withstand the anguish."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_62,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_63,"You're telling me there's a reprehensible organization like this in the Ark, yet we haven't heard anything about it?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_64,"Well, now that I've been informed, I can't turn a blind eye to this."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_65,"I may not know the full scoop as it were,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_66,"but you are {AccountData.NickName}-kun's friend, that's good enough for me."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_67,"For that alone, I'll take you at your word."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_68,Hee hee. Good thinking.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_69,What is it that you require? Additional manpower?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_70,Yes. There is always strength in numbers.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_71,Even better if you can find specialists who excel at facing several foes at once. They will be our most powerful strategic assets.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_72,Very well.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_73,I have my fair share of experience with resolving conflicts between different organizations.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_74,...??
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_75,Sakura raises one hand and summons her henchmen.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_76,Boss!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_77,We are to engage in a conflict.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_78,This Nikke will tell you the position of the hostile forces.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_79,"In three days' time, you will capture each and every senior member of the opposing organization. I want them alive."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_80,"Yes, ma'am!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_81,Wa... Wait! Wait a second!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_82,What?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_83,Um... it's just that...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_84,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_85,Hee hee.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_86,Muahahahaha!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_87,Oh boy...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_88,I didn't expect to actually meet someone willing to indulge me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_89,"It's always super awkward having to break character, but..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_90,"Aw man, this sucks."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_91,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_92,Guillotine takes out her cell phone.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_93,... It's me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_94,"Ingrid, I mean... Codename Jarhead."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_95,Why didn't you tell me the leader of an actual organization in the Outpost had shown up?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_96,"If I'd known, I wouldn't have..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_97,What?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_98,What do you mean this is Mustang's jurisdiction? So I have to care of it myself?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_99,"No, no. Listen. It's because of your carelessness that I'm about to get wrapped up in a real-life conflict! What does..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_100,The other end hangs up.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_101,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_102,Well?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_103,Where are these dastardly villains you want us to defeat?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_104,Erm... Partner...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_105,Have you sensed it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_106,The time has finally come...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_107,... for me to utilize my hidden skill of teleportation.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_108,Take me with you.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_109,... Just go. I'll handle the rest.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_110,No.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_111,You're the Great Qualifier. The only one capable of making alterations to the metaverse.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_112,"Don't fret. Even if you remain here, we may well meet again in another parallel universe."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_113,"Please forgive me, Partner."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_114,*Sob* I have faith in you. I'm leaving. Farewell.
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_115,L
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_116,Telema
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_117,Solus
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_118,"Guillotine scampers off, twirling the hem of her coat."
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_119,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_120,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_121,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun, could you perhaps explain to me what just happened?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_122,What is this all about?
d_ex_wingofvictory_05_123,I... honestly have no idea.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_title,Spring Fashion
d_ex_clothingstore_05_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_clothingstore_05_2,Anyone here?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_3,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_4,"Oh, hey!"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_5,You were the one at the Sakura Ceremony!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_6,"I'm sorry, but the Snow Queen isn't here right now."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_7,"That's okay. I'm here for you, Alice."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_8,Do you still remember the promise we made on the road where the ceremony would be held?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_9,"Oh sure, clear as day."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_10,You said you'd bring a touch of spring to our clothing selection.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_11,Right.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_12,"To be exact, I agreed to lend you some traditional costumes that you could wear to the ceremony."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_13,"I didn't know if there'd be any customers besides you, so I brought a lot of different options."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_14,Wowee!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_15,"You've got some spring fashions for Rabbity, too?"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_16,...?!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_17,"Yes, I brought a few outfits fit for a commander as well. Just in case."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_18,"Would you like to try some of them on, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_19,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_20,The girls look at me with anticipation.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_21,... I'll try some of them on.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_22,I take the costume to the inner office.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_23,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_24,I fumble through swathes of cloth with sleeves attached to them.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_25,There are also various ropes that I have no idea how to tie properly.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_26,How should I do this?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_27,Wrap the ropes loosely around my waist and tie them up.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_28,Search for more information on my phone.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_29,*Rustling*
d_ex_clothingstore_05_30,I put the outfit on as best as I could. Time for the big reveal.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_31,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_32,I don't even know where to start my search.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_33,Wrap the ropes loosely around my waist and tie them up.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_34,A moment later.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_35,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_36,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_37,"Haha, oh Rabbity! Aren't you embarrassed looking like that?"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_38,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_39,that costume isn't meant to be worn like a bathrobe.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_40,And why are the ropes tied so...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_41,haphazardly?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_42,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_43,Come with me.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_44,I'll show you how to wear this properly.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_45,Go ahead and take off your clothes.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_46,I'll turn around.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_47,You... want me to take everything off?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_48,"All right, I'll get down to my birthday suit."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_49,... That's not what I meant.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_50,Your pants and underwear can stay on.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_51,What we need is some gray fabric that doesn't have any patterns. Should be easy enough to find.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_52,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_53,"Among the pile of clothes, there is one in gray that fits the bill."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_54,Pick it up and put it on.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_55,*Rustling*
d_ex_clothingstore_05_56,Are you ready?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_57,Ready.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_58,"Okay, looking good so far."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_59,Now...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_60,Sakura turns around and stands behind me.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_61,*Swoosh*
d_ex_clothingstore_05_62,"First, put your arms into the sleeves."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_63,"The right part of the neckline should be inside, with the left part overlapping it."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_64,"Now, about this rope."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_65,Sakura takes the rope and stands in front of me again.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_66,"Tie it around your waist, then take the ends and wrap them inside the hem of the outfit, neatly."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_67,Then overlay this belt on the rope and tie it up...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_68,"She's so close, I can almost hear her breathing."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_69,I'll do the rest by myself.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_70,Stand there and remain perfectly still.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_71,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_72,Sakura puts down the outfit and steps back.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_73,What's the next step?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_74,Put the belt around your stomach and tie it nice and tight.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_75,"Fold the rest of the fabric and tie it into a knot. It can be any kind of knot, whichever you prefer."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_76,"If you get confused trying to tie the knot,"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_77,"just let me know, and I'll help."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_78,I fumble with the belt for some time.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_79,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_80,Just let me do it for you.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_81,"With the way you're going, I'm afraid you're going to end up looking all disheveled again."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_82,Fine...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_83,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_84,Whoops!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_85,I can't believe I made a mistake like that. That's not like me at all.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_86,I guess I am a little nervous.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_87,"Helping others get dressed isn't exactly a common thing for me, after all."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_88,"Don't worry, we're almost done."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_89,Nod my head.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_90,"The tension in the air is so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Sakura quickens her pace."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_91,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_92,... Done.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_93,"Handsome, just as expected."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_94,It looks like it was tailor-made for you.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_95,"Thank you for all your help, Sakura."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_96,Don't mention it.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_97,I was glad to help.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_98,"Although I must say, this is usually something reserved for spouses, so I do feel a bit strange..."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_99,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_100,Um... Anyway.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_101,We should get going. Alice is waiting for us.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_102,"Wow! Looking good, Rabbity!"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_103,You look like a warrior from those legends!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_104,Huh?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_105,"How come your face is so red, Pink Empress?"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_106,Wha... my face? It is?
d_ex_clothingstore_05_107,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_108,I need a mirror.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_109,Sakura fishes in her coat pocket and takes out her compact.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_110,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_111,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun, why didn't you tell me I looked like this?!"
d_ex_clothingstore_05_112,Because...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_113,It's not everyday I get to see you blush.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_114,You look cute like this.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_115,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_116,How... How could you say something like that to a gang leader?!
d_ex_clothingstore_05_117,...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_118,I need to get out of here.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_119,I wouldn't have come if I knew I would be mocked like this...
d_ex_clothingstore_05_120,"So you soon... No, on second thought, see you in a while."
d_ex_clothingstore_05_121,*Jingle*
d_ex_clothingstore_05_122,Sakura runs off.
d_ex_clothingstore_05_123,I should get changed quickly and catch up with her.
d_ex_cafe_05_title,Tea Time
d_ex_cafe_05_1,This tea is lovely.
d_ex_cafe_05_2,I'm glad to see we have the same taste when it comes to tea.
d_ex_cafe_05_3,"Haha, that we do."
d_ex_cafe_05_4,"As I step into the cafe, I'm immediately greeted by the sight of Ludmilla and Sakura drinking tea together."
d_ex_cafe_05_5,Ludmilla?
d_ex_cafe_05_6,Sakura?
d_ex_cafe_05_7,I didn't expect to meet you here in the cafe. What brings you here?
d_ex_cafe_05_8,{AccountData.NickName}-kun? What are you doing in the cafe?
d_ex_cafe_05_9,I was just passing by.
d_ex_cafe_05_10,What about you two?
d_ex_cafe_05_11,I heard that Ludmilla likes tea.
d_ex_cafe_05_12,So we arranged to meet and try some.
d_ex_cafe_05_13,Sakura has all sorts of wonderful teas here.
d_ex_cafe_05_14,"Wait, this place sells tea as well?"
d_ex_cafe_05_15,No. They only sell coffee here.
d_ex_cafe_05_16,We're drinking some tea I got from some people who work in the Chamber of Commerce.
d_ex_cafe_05_17,Are you allowed to bring in outside food here?
d_ex_cafe_05_18,"I've rented the entire place for the day, so it's okay."
d_ex_cafe_05_19,"Thanks to you, I get to sample some of these magnificent teas. What an honor."
d_ex_cafe_05_20,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_21,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_22,Sakura and Ludmilla go back to drinking tea and chatting.
d_ex_cafe_05_23,Black tea never disappoints.
d_ex_cafe_05_24,I prefer black tea as well.
d_ex_cafe_05_25,"First you've got the mesmerizing color of the tea itself, then there's the intoxicating aroma and distinct bitterness to the taste."
d_ex_cafe_05_26,And it pairs wonderfully with desserts.
d_ex_cafe_05_27,Truly a most delightful blend.
d_ex_cafe_05_28,This next one here is oolong tea.
d_ex_cafe_05_29,"Oh, very nice!"
d_ex_cafe_05_30,"Black tea may be my favorite, but oolong is a close second."
d_ex_cafe_05_31,It's less bitter and has a refreshing aftertaste. One of my favorites.
d_ex_cafe_05_32,Would you like to try some?
d_ex_cafe_05_33,Of course.
d_ex_cafe_05_34,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_35,"Very different from black tea, but still quite nice."
d_ex_cafe_05_36,"Would you like a cup as well, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_ex_cafe_05_37,Let me think...
d_ex_cafe_05_38,Could I have some Nilgiri Tea?
d_ex_cafe_05_39,Can I have some Brown Rice Green Tea?
d_ex_cafe_05_40,I see you're a fan of more exotic tea blends.
d_ex_cafe_05_41,Coming right up.
d_ex_cafe_05_42,*Clank* *Clank*
d_ex_cafe_05_43,*Swoosh*
d_ex_cafe_05_44,"Sakura places some tea leaves into the teapot, fills it with water, then proceeds to pour the tea into a cup."
d_ex_cafe_05_45,Here you go.
d_ex_cafe_05_46,Thanks.
d_ex_cafe_05_47,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_48,How is it?
d_ex_cafe_05_49,Very nice!
d_ex_cafe_05_50,I never knew tea could be packed with so much flavor!
d_ex_cafe_05_51,"Ha, looks like you're quite enamored with it, Servant."
d_ex_cafe_05_52,"Now, have another sip, but try to really take in the aroma this time."
d_ex_cafe_05_53,"It will help enhance the taste, and make it richer."
d_ex_cafe_05_54,I see...
d_ex_cafe_05_55,Partner?
d_ex_cafe_05_56,Sugar?
d_ex_cafe_05_57,You're joining these ladies for teatime? Color me surprised.
d_ex_cafe_05_58,"I was just passing by, so I figured I'd try a few blends."
d_ex_cafe_05_59,"Are you here for the tea as well, Sugar?"
d_ex_cafe_05_60,Actually...
d_ex_cafe_05_61,"Come to think of it, I don't believe I've ever had tea before."
d_ex_cafe_05_62,"Any chance I could have a cup? If you don't mind, of course."
d_ex_cafe_05_63,Not at all. What kind of tea would you like?
d_ex_cafe_05_64,"Whichever has sugar, I guess."
d_ex_cafe_05_65,Tea is made using water and tea leaves only. No added sugar.
d_ex_cafe_05_66,But... how the... no sugar...?
d_ex_cafe_05_67,How about some floral tea instead?
d_ex_cafe_05_68,It's the sweetest one I brought with me.
d_ex_cafe_05_69,*Clank* *Clank*
d_ex_cafe_05_70,*Swoosh*
d_ex_cafe_05_71,*Click*
d_ex_cafe_05_72,Here you go.
d_ex_cafe_05_73,Let's see...
d_ex_cafe_05_74,Smells nice.
d_ex_cafe_05_75,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_76,...
d_ex_cafe_05_77,... How is it?
d_ex_cafe_05_78,What do you think?
d_ex_cafe_05_79,Well?
d_ex_cafe_05_80,I feel like something is missing.
d_ex_cafe_05_81,I wanna give it a little extra zing. Wait a second.
d_ex_cafe_05_82,After a while.
d_ex_cafe_05_83,... Why is it a different color now?
d_ex_cafe_05_84,What is that powdery stuff swirling around in the cup?
d_ex_cafe_05_85,This stuff really zips now! Try it out.
d_ex_cafe_05_86,"... Sakura, you first."
d_ex_cafe_05_87,"... Ludmilla, you first."
d_ex_cafe_05_88,"All right, I'll try it."
d_ex_cafe_05_89,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_90,...
d_ex_cafe_05_91,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_92,...
d_ex_cafe_05_93,Sakura's face begins to twitch uncontrollably. She seems on the verge of collapse.
d_ex_cafe_05_94,What on earth did you do to that tea?
d_ex_cafe_05_95,I just added a little bit of brown sugar.
d_ex_cafe_05_96,"10 spoonfuls, that's all."
d_ex_cafe_05_97,...
d_ex_cafe_05_98,What do you say?
d_ex_cafe_05_99,"Way better, isn't it?"
d_ex_cafe_05_100,*Click*
d_ex_cafe_05_101,The sweetness completely overwhelms the taste of the tea itself.
d_ex_cafe_05_102,It's like I just inhaled a mouthful of sugar.
d_ex_cafe_05_103,Artificial sweeteners shouldn't be within a mile of tea like this.
d_ex_cafe_05_104,Really?
d_ex_cafe_05_105,*Slurp*
d_ex_cafe_05_106,But it's nice and sweet now. I think it's a heck of a lot better.
d_ex_cafe_05_107,"Hehe, well it doesn't seem like Sakura is much of a fan."
d_ex_cafe_05_108,Do you have any other sweeteners?
d_ex_cafe_05_109,"Sure, I've got all kinds. I'll bring 'em over so Sakura can have a look."
d_ex_cafe_05_110,I guarantee you'll find something you like.
d_ex_cafe_05_111,"Sugar runs off into the backroom, sipping at the teacup the entire way."
d_ex_cafe_05_112,*Knock knock*
d_ex_cafe_05_113,Adding sugar to a tea like this... it's an insult!
d_ex_cafe_05_114,Sakura wipes her mouth with a handkerchief.
d_ex_cafe_05_115,"Agreed. Tea and sugar should be kept separate, and never the twain shall meet."
d_ex_cafe_05_116,"If you like, we could continue our tea sampling somewhere else. How about my place?"
d_ex_cafe_05_117,Sounds great.
d_ex_cafe_05_118,Let's go.
d_ex_cafe_05_119,... Take me with you.
d_ex_cafe_05_120,"The three of us leave the cafe, ditching Sugar."
d_ex_church_05_title,The Final Judgment
d_ex_church_05_1,"There have been reported sightings of a mysterious angelic figure, so I head towards the church."
d_ex_church_05_2,... {AccountData.NickName}.
d_ex_church_05_3,You have something to do with religions? That's news to me.
d_ex_church_05_4,"I received a report of some suspicious individuals in the area, so I came to investigate."
d_ex_church_05_5,I came to see the angel.
d_ex_church_05_6,Really?
d_ex_church_05_7,...
d_ex_church_05_8,Have you come here to try and kill it?
d_ex_church_05_9,Only Nikkes come to this place.
d_ex_church_05_10,Dispatching such targets is not within my purview.
d_ex_church_05_11,"However, I could allow Enikk to make a judgment if necessary."
d_ex_church_05_12,Is that so?
d_ex_church_05_13,Aren't you a bit naïve?
d_ex_church_05_14,Only two kinds of figures command respect in religious sects.
d_ex_church_05_15,Kindly saints.
d_ex_church_05_16,And duplicitous sinners.
d_ex_church_05_17,What will you do if the angels end up being a force for good?
d_ex_church_05_18,What will you do if the angels end up being a force for evil?
d_ex_church_05_19,I won't impede them in any way.
d_ex_church_05_20,I'd leave them be.
d_ex_church_05_21,...
d_ex_church_05_22,Only Nikkes come to this place.
d_ex_church_05_23,Dispatching such targets is not within my purview.
d_ex_church_05_24,"However, I could allow Enikk to make a judgment if necessary."
d_ex_church_05_25,...
d_ex_church_05_26,Here we are.
d_ex_church_05_27,*Whew*
d_ex_church_05_28,"As the doors to the church fling open,"
d_ex_church_05_29,"a winged creature, somewhat reminiscent of an angel, descends."
d_ex_church_05_30,D and I quickly find a place to hide.
d_ex_church_05_31,How peculiar...
d_ex_church_05_32,Why do I sense their presence in my secret base?
d_ex_church_05_33,Could it be...?
d_ex_church_05_34,Have they found out I've made this place my second base and staked it out?
d_ex_church_05_35,...
d_ex_church_05_36,"No, that can't be it. I'm sure they're far too busy with other matters."
d_ex_church_05_37,They can't be here.
d_ex_church_05_38,I communicate with D by whispering and using hand signals.
d_ex_church_05_39,(Do you know her?)
d_ex_church_05_40,(She's been stalking me for a while now.)
d_ex_church_05_41,(She's a Pilgrim.)
d_ex_church_05_42,??
d_ex_church_05_43,(How'd you get caught up with someone like her?)
d_ex_church_05_44,(I wish I knew.)
d_ex_church_05_45,...
d_ex_church_05_46,(What's a Pilgrim doing here?)
d_ex_church_05_47,(She might have come looking for me.)
d_ex_church_05_48,(Then why are you hiding?)
d_ex_church_05_49,(I'm petrified of her.)
d_ex_church_05_50,"Now, let's see..."
d_ex_church_05_51,Isabel opens up the bag she has been carrying.
d_ex_church_05_52,I've got to prepare some food for them.
d_ex_church_05_53,They're probably been eating nothing but Splendamin for weeks now.
d_ex_church_05_54,They must be dying for a proper meal.
d_ex_church_05_55,Isabel takes out a portable pot.
d_ex_church_05_56,She tosses in a medley of ingredients and begins cooking up a soup.
d_ex_church_05_57,... Scrumptious. They're gonna love it.
d_ex_church_05_58,"Next up, I have to prepare a clean set of clothes."
d_ex_church_05_59,We might be spending a few days in our little sanctuary of love.
d_ex_church_05_60,"If the mood strikes him, I'll have to..."
d_ex_church_05_61,*Rustle*
d_ex_church_05_62,Isabel produces some clothes from the bag.
d_ex_church_05_63,"I can make out a few pairs of underwear, along with some devices that seem rather suspect."
d_ex_church_05_64,(My underwear!)
d_ex_church_05_65,"(Wait, are those devices...)"
d_ex_church_05_66,(How did she get those?)
d_ex_church_05_67,(I certainly didn't give them to her.)
d_ex_church_05_68,...
d_ex_church_05_69,"(Not only is she sexually perverse, but she's a thief!)"
d_ex_church_05_70,(What is it?)
d_ex_church_05_71,(... I can't say it.)
d_ex_church_05_72,(You're blushing.)
d_ex_church_05_73,(It doesn't take a genius to guess what she intends to use those for.)
d_ex_church_05_74,...
d_ex_church_05_75,(Sounds like she's into some kinky stuff.)
d_ex_church_05_76,"(A bit eccentric, but not bad enough to notify Enikk.)"
d_ex_church_05_77,(Let's keep watching.)
d_ex_church_05_78,"Last but not least,"
d_ex_church_05_79,some romantic restraints.
d_ex_church_05_80,"Given how strong their moral code is,"
d_ex_church_05_81,I'm sure they'll want to return to the Commander's Room after a week or so.
d_ex_church_05_82,*Crunch*
d_ex_church_05_83,Isabel hides some heavy chains under the bench.
d_ex_church_05_84,"Ah, I nearly forgot."
d_ex_church_05_85,They're always surrounded by their little coterie of women.
d_ex_church_05_86,"Can't be having them interfere with our romantic interlude, no sir."
d_ex_church_05_87,Isabel installs some kind of device at the entrance of the church.
d_ex_church_05_88,"If I were to guess, it seems to be a booby trap of some sort."
d_ex_church_05_89,Voilà!
d_ex_church_05_90,All that's left to do is bring them here.
d_ex_church_05_91,They must be having coffee in their room right about now.
d_ex_church_05_92,A few sleeping pills in their drink will make it a bit easier to bring them here.
d_ex_church_05_93,"Then, with the two of us in this sacred place, we'll both be joined in holy matrimony!"
d_ex_church_05_94,...
d_ex_church_05_95,(Did you agree to this?)
d_ex_church_05_96,(Of course not.)
d_ex_church_05_97,"(Sexual deviancy, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment.)"
d_ex_church_05_98,(Attempted poisoning.)
d_ex_church_05_99,"(Plus there's that trap she set up, which could harm innocent people.)"
d_ex_church_05_100,(There is more than enough to tip the scales against her.)
d_ex_church_05_101,"(However, the Outpost is your jurisdiction.)"
d_ex_church_05_102,(So it's your call.)
d_ex_church_05_103,(How should we proceed?)
d_ex_church_05_104,(Do you want to report her to Enikk?)
d_ex_church_05_105,(... No.)
d_ex_church_05_106,(Isabel doesn't intend on harming anyone. I'm the only one she wants.)
d_ex_church_05_107,(Everything tends to pan out fine as long as I avoid her.)
d_ex_church_05_108,...
d_ex_church_05_109,(You sure?)
d_ex_church_05_110,"(If that's your judgment, so be it.)"
d_ex_church_05_111,"(I'll be on my way, then.)"
d_ex_church_05_112,"Just as D is about to sneak out of the church,"
d_ex_church_05_113,I pull her back.
d_ex_church_05_114,(... wait a minute.)
d_ex_church_05_115,(I'd rather not be left here alone.)
d_ex_church_05_116,(What do you want me to do about it?)
d_ex_church_05_117,(Please let me come with you.)
d_ex_church_05_118,...
d_ex_hotel_06_title,Sanctuary
d_ex_hotel_06_1,"I'm bushed, and head to a hotel to get some rest."
d_ex_hotel_06_2,No one is at the reception desk.
d_ex_hotel_06_3,"No one is in the hallway, either."
d_ex_hotel_06_4,"Despite the disconcerting lack of hotel staff,"
d_ex_hotel_06_5,the room itself is
d_ex_hotel_06_6,as immaculate as ever.
d_ex_hotel_06_7,I plop down on the bed.
d_ex_hotel_06_8,...
d_ex_hotel_06_9,...
d_ex_hotel_06_10,...
d_ex_hotel_06_11,Are you sure you want to do this?
d_ex_hotel_06_12,Even if it means bending the rules?
d_ex_hotel_06_13,...
d_ex_hotel_06_14,Don't worry.
d_ex_hotel_06_15,I'll take care of them while they're asleep.
d_ex_hotel_06_16,D reaches out to me.
d_ex_hotel_06_17,Hold on.
d_ex_hotel_06_18,...!
d_ex_hotel_06_19,"You're not here to kill me, are you?"
d_ex_hotel_06_20,What are you going to do to me?
d_ex_hotel_06_21,... No.
d_ex_hotel_06_22,No one can kill the guests in here.
d_ex_hotel_06_23,Not even assassins like us.
d_ex_hotel_06_24,"I don't know what's running through your mind,"
d_ex_hotel_06_25,but I'm not here to kill you.
d_ex_hotel_06_26,Guests are not to be harmed in any way.
d_ex_hotel_06_27,It's the number one rule of this hotel.
d_ex_hotel_06_28,Then why did you barge into my room?
d_ex_hotel_06_29,"To look after you, what else?"
d_ex_hotel_06_30,You're running a fever.
d_ex_hotel_06_31,We were about to take your temperature and see if we needed to get you any medicine.
d_ex_hotel_06_32,Then you woke up and spoiled all the fun.
d_ex_hotel_06_33,...
d_ex_hotel_06_34,"Anyway, let me take your temperature."
d_ex_hotel_06_35,I nod.
d_ex_hotel_06_36,D places her hand on my forehead.
d_ex_hotel_06_37,You're hot to the touch.
d_ex_hotel_06_38,"K, get me some medicine from the office."
d_ex_hotel_06_39,You got it.
d_ex_hotel_06_40,Do you two... work here?
d_ex_hotel_06_41,Yep!
d_ex_hotel_06_42,"Being an assassin can get tiring,"
d_ex_hotel_06_43,y'know.
d_ex_hotel_06_44,"Whenever we're given a target, that person's life hangs in the balance."
d_ex_hotel_06_45,The decision as to whether they live or die rests entirely on our shoulders.
d_ex_hotel_06_46,"After we've made our final judgment, we have to live with that decision from then on."
d_ex_hotel_06_47,"We may not be entirely human,"
d_ex_hotel_06_48,but even we can't live every day
d_ex_hotel_06_49,with that kind of burden weighing us down.
d_ex_hotel_06_50,We've got to find some respite from the heaviness of it all somehow.
d_ex_hotel_06_51,"So, we opened this hotel."
d_ex_hotel_06_52,It doesn't matter if you're a saint or a sinner.
d_ex_hotel_06_53,"As long as you're within these walls,"
d_ex_hotel_06_54,no harm will come to you. Not from us at least.
d_ex_hotel_06_55,"Trust us, your life isn't in any danger whatsoever."
d_ex_hotel_06_56,But why make it an unmanned hotel?
d_ex_hotel_06_57,Why can't you show your faces to the customers?
d_ex_hotel_06_58,That's rule number two.
d_ex_hotel_06_59,We're assassins.
d_ex_hotel_06_60,Parading ourselves out in the open may upset the guests.
d_ex_hotel_06_61,"Yeah, it might give people nightmares."
d_ex_hotel_06_62,Worrying about axes flying towards their heads and such.
d_ex_hotel_06_63,"After all, you had the wrong idea yourself just a moment ago."
d_ex_hotel_06_64,So you're doing this for the sake of your guests.
d_ex_hotel_06_65,You could say that.
d_ex_hotel_06_66,I'll go get the medicine. D will stay here with you.
d_ex_hotel_06_67,...
d_ex_hotel_06_68,D puts her hand on my forehead again.
d_ex_hotel_06_69,You're burning up.
d_ex_hotel_06_70,Lie down.
d_ex_hotel_06_71,Get some sleep.
d_ex_hotel_06_72,We'll have some medicine and a warm meal ready for you when you wake up.
d_ex_hotel_06_73,D.
d_ex_hotel_06_74,...?
d_ex_hotel_06_75,You've got a nice hotel here.
d_ex_hotel_06_76,Your customer service is second-to-none.
d_ex_hotel_06_77,...
d_ex_hotel_06_78,Thanks.
d_ex_hotel_06_79,Come whenever you're in need of a sanctuary.
d_ex_hotel_06_80,No matter what time of day it is.
d_ex_trainstation_05_title,Spies at the Train Station
d_ex_trainstation_05_1,"I'm walking by the train station,"
d_ex_trainstation_05_2,when I notice some strange movement.
d_ex_trainstation_05_3,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_4,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_5,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_6,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_7,"What are you doing, D?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_8,"What are you doing, Cocoa?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_9,"As you can see, I'm being followed."
d_ex_trainstation_05_10,Although I haven't the faintest idea why.
d_ex_trainstation_05_11,Want me to ask her?
d_ex_trainstation_05_12,That'd be much appreciated.
d_ex_trainstation_05_13,"Cocoa, why are you trailing after D?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_14,Sssh!
d_ex_trainstation_05_15,Can't you see I'm tailing her?
d_ex_trainstation_05_16,"Yes, but why?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_17,A professional maid should possess a wide range of skills.
d_ex_trainstation_05_18,I've been honing my infiltration and stalking skills for over a year now.
d_ex_trainstation_05_19,This is the first time I've seen someone walk so surreptitiously.
d_ex_trainstation_05_20,"If it weren't for Cocorella's thermal tracking, I'd have lost her long ago."
d_ex_trainstation_05_21,"Whoever she is, I mustn't let her out of my sight."
d_ex_trainstation_05_22,She must be a spy sent from the Intelligence Department.
d_ex_trainstation_05_23,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_24,Did you catch all that?
d_ex_trainstation_05_25,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_26,Looks like this situation calls for a little acting.
d_ex_trainstation_05_27,"Help me, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_trainstation_05_28,How? Do you want ideas on what role you should play?
d_ex_trainstation_05_29,This little girl seems to be a fan of classic spy espionage.
d_ex_trainstation_05_30,Not cold-blooded assassinations.
d_ex_trainstation_05_31,We need to come up with a scenario that's tailored to our personalities.
d_ex_trainstation_05_32,Who will I be playing?
d_ex_trainstation_05_33,It's very kind of you to humor her like this.
d_ex_trainstation_05_34,You'll be like a character straight out of an old film noir.
d_ex_trainstation_05_35,"For example,"
d_ex_trainstation_05_36,"a messenger for an organization, or something along those lines."
d_ex_trainstation_05_37,I'm not so stern with everyone.
d_ex_trainstation_05_38,"Those who remain on the right side of the law,"
d_ex_trainstation_05_39,I treat with utmost kindness.
d_ex_trainstation_05_40,"Now, I was hoping you could do me a favor."
d_ex_trainstation_05_41,"Sure, what do you need me to do?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_42,You're going to pretend to be a messenger for an organization.
d_ex_trainstation_05_43,See that bench over there?
d_ex_trainstation_05_44,"Walk over to it, but act natural."
d_ex_trainstation_05_45,Sit down.
d_ex_trainstation_05_46,Take out your tablet and pretend to watch the news.
d_ex_trainstation_05_47,"Then, you'll give me the signal."
d_ex_trainstation_05_48,A signal? Like what?
d_ex_trainstation_05_49,"A hand gesture, or something with your eyes."
d_ex_trainstation_05_50,Something that I'll be able to discern easily.
d_ex_trainstation_05_51,Got it.
d_ex_trainstation_05_52,I go to the bench and sit down.
d_ex_trainstation_05_53,I take out a tablet and open the Daily Ark homepage.
d_ex_trainstation_05_54,Slowly...
d_ex_trainstation_05_55,I make an L with my hand that's holding the tablet.
d_ex_trainstation_05_56,I start blinking in morse code.
d_ex_trainstation_05_57,Is that the signal?
d_ex_trainstation_05_58,He must be the messenger sent by the Handler.
d_ex_trainstation_05_59,The mission is... To monitor L.
d_ex_trainstation_05_60,My colleague is the target? No! This can't be happening!
d_ex_trainstation_05_61,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_62,I'm pretty sure I saw this same story in a movie last year.
d_ex_trainstation_05_63,"If I remember correctly, L will receive the very same order."
d_ex_trainstation_05_64,Then they spy on each other.
d_ex_trainstation_05_65,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_66,D takes out her cell phone and puts it on her ear.
d_ex_trainstation_05_67,... L.
d_ex_trainstation_05_68,"Yes, I've made contact with the messenger on the platform."
d_ex_trainstation_05_69,What? You've been issued the same assignment?
d_ex_trainstation_05_70,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_71,Understood.
d_ex_trainstation_05_72,You and I will join forces.
d_ex_trainstation_05_73,I'm making my way to you now.
d_ex_trainstation_05_74,D vaults over something and starts crawling upward.
d_ex_trainstation_05_75,She slips through an open window on the ceiling that's slightly ajar.
d_ex_trainstation_05_76,Hey!
d_ex_trainstation_05_77,This must be the climax! Up and away!
d_ex_trainstation_05_78,I've gotta catch up to her!
d_ex_trainstation_05_79,Cocoa leaps up nimbly.
d_ex_trainstation_05_80,*Jump*
d_ex_trainstation_05_81,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_82,*Jump*
d_ex_trainstation_05_83,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_84,"Master, help me up!"
d_ex_trainstation_05_85,She's long gone at this point.
d_ex_trainstation_05_86,You ought to know climbing public buildings is forbidden.
d_ex_trainstation_05_87,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_88,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_89,The spy got away?
d_ex_trainstation_05_90,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_91,...
d_ex_trainstation_05_92,It is?
d_ex_trainstation_05_93,Yes.
d_ex_trainstation_05_94,Then... I suppose there's nothing else we can do.
d_ex_trainstation_05_95,A proper maid should also know when to call it a day.
d_ex_trainstation_05_96,That's enough stalking for today. I should head back to the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_trainstation_05_97,"Are you coming, Master?"
d_ex_trainstation_05_98,"I've got some new patterns I could draw with the ketchup. The spy's face, a train platform..."
d_ex_trainstation_05_99,Then I can show it off to everyone.
d_ex_trainstation_05_100,Cocoa grabs my hand and leads me out of the railway station.
d_ex_court_05_title,The Case of the Missing Chocolate
d_ex_court_05_1,Rei and I have come to the courthouse on a field trip.
d_ex_court_05_2,So this is the courthouse...
d_ex_court_05_3,Is this your first time coming here?
d_ex_court_05_4,It sure is.
d_ex_court_05_5,Have you been here before?
d_ex_court_05_6,"Yeah, I came here to fill out my divorce papers."
d_ex_court_05_7,"Yeah, they locked me up in here once."
d_ex_court_05_8,...!!
d_ex_court_05_9,You've been married before?
d_ex_court_05_10,...!!
d_ex_court_05_11,What kind of crime did you commit?
d_ex_court_05_12,...
d_ex_court_05_13,"Don't worry, you can tell me. My lips are sealed."
d_ex_court_05_14,"... Rei seems to have fallen for my joke hook, line and sinker."
d_ex_court_05_15,I was just joking.
d_ex_court_05_16,"Honestly, Teacher, it's okay."
d_ex_court_05_17,You can tell me.
d_ex_court_05_18,I'm in my third year. I can handle this kind of information with no problem.
d_ex_court_05_19,...
d_ex_court_05_20,It honestly was a joke.
d_ex_court_05_21,"I'm telling you, I didn't do anything."
d_ex_court_05_22,... Sure thing!
d_ex_court_05_23,I read you loud and clear.
d_ex_court_05_24,Your secret is safe with me.
d_ex_court_05_25,...??
d_ex_court_05_26,"Anyhoo, what are we doing here today?"
d_ex_court_05_27,There's nothing fun about a courthouse.
d_ex_court_05_28,Perfect timing.
d_ex_court_05_29,"Hey, Privaty."
d_ex_court_05_30,You have no idea how quickly I rushed over here when I heard you'd be coming here
d_ex_court_05_31,on an educational field trip.
d_ex_court_05_32,Have you prepared something for us?
d_ex_court_05_33,"This is my first time doing something like this, but I've prepared a mock trial for all of us."
d_ex_court_05_34,"After all, the best way to learn something is to get in the thick of it."
d_ex_court_05_35,A mock trial?
d_ex_court_05_36,You mean like cosplay?
d_ex_court_05_37,Naru and I do that all the time!
d_ex_court_05_38,It'll be a blast!
d_ex_court_05_39,I'm glad you're into it. Let's head inside the courtroom.
d_ex_court_05_40,This is the courthouse.
d_ex_court_05_41,It's where the guilty and the innocent are judged.
d_ex_court_05_42,I'll be the prosecutor and Rei can be the judge.
d_ex_court_05_43,What about me?
d_ex_court_05_44,Commander...
d_ex_court_05_45,You can be both the defendant and the defense attorney.
d_ex_court_05_46,How come I'm the only one pulling double duty?
d_ex_court_05_47,What can I say? We're short-handed here.
d_ex_court_05_48,I thought there'd be more people coming.
d_ex_court_05_49,It's not like Rei's penguin will make an ace attorney.
d_ex_court_05_50,Rude.
d_ex_court_05_51,Guilty.
d_ex_court_05_52,Objection.
d_ex_court_05_53,...
d_ex_court_05_54,...
d_ex_court_05_55,"Naru 1, 2 and 3 are perfectly capable of practicing law!"
d_ex_court_05_56,Yeah?
d_ex_court_05_57,"All right then, they can act as the Commander's defense."
d_ex_court_05_58,"What, exactly, are the charges against me?"
d_ex_court_05_59,"Oh, right. Can't have a trial without charges."
d_ex_court_05_60,...
d_ex_court_05_61,Nincompoop.
d_ex_court_05_62,Balderdash.
d_ex_court_05_63,Moron.
d_ex_court_05_64,What'd you say to me?!
d_ex_court_05_65,Everybody calm down.
d_ex_court_05_66,Anyway... what was your crime...
d_ex_court_05_67,Being too handsome.
d_ex_court_05_68,"Theft, because I stole your heart."
d_ex_court_05_69,...
d_ex_court_05_70,...
d_ex_court_05_71,I'd like to absolve myself of my client.
d_ex_court_05_72,Me too.
d_ex_court_05_73,Ditto.
d_ex_court_05_74,"Fine, let's just say I stole some of Rei's chocolate."
d_ex_court_05_75,"Actually, I thought your original suggestion wasn't too bad..."
d_ex_court_05_76,??
d_ex_court_05_77,"Um, nothing. Okay, that's the charge."
d_ex_court_05_78,Let's get this trial underway.
d_ex_court_05_79,"To the defendant, what do you have to say for yourself?"
d_ex_court_05_80,Why did you steal my chocolate?
d_ex_court_05_81,"I'm innocent, Your Honor."
d_ex_court_05_82,I didn't realize it was Rei's chocolate when I ate it.
d_ex_court_05_83,"Objection, Your Honor. That's impossible."
d_ex_court_05_84,"Even if the defendant didn't realize the chocolate belonged to Rei, they still ate it knowing that it wasn't theirs."
d_ex_court_05_85,This is an open-and-shut case. They are guilty of theft.
d_ex_court_05_86,A fair point.
d_ex_court_05_87,"Naru, what's that saying again?"
d_ex_court_05_88,Today's petty criminal is tomorrow's hardened felon.
d_ex_court_05_89,"Yeah, something like that."
d_ex_court_05_90,Do you have any idea how precious that chocolate was to me?
d_ex_court_05_91,I saved my pocket money for several days in order to buy it.
d_ex_court_05_92,I would like to give you two pieces of chocolate as compensation.
d_ex_court_05_93,"Wait, really? Are you serious?"
d_ex_court_05_94,"Okay, then! Case clos--"
d_ex_court_05_95,Wait! Your Honor. We are here to judge whether the defendant is guilty or innocent!
d_ex_court_05_96,I beseech you to pass judgment in a fair and impartial manner.
d_ex_court_05_97,But...
d_ex_court_05_98,They're gonna give me two pieces of chocolate...
d_ex_court_05_99,Is that really all it takes to bribe you?
d_ex_court_05_100,"Might I remind you, Your Honor, that bribery is also a crime. If you accept those chocolates, your reputation will be in ruins."
d_ex_court_05_101,Fine. Five pieces.
d_ex_court_05_102,F-five?
d_ex_court_05_103,C-Commander.
d_ex_court_05_104,Could you please take this more seriously?
d_ex_court_05_105,Ten.
d_ex_court_05_106,??
d_ex_court_05_107,"I'm willing to give you ten pieces of chocolate, Your Honor."
d_ex_court_05_108,...!!
d_ex_court_05_109,Not guilty!!
d_ex_court_05_110,*Bang bang*
d_ex_court_05_111,Is there any chance you could throw in five more pieces?
d_ex_court_05_112,What the...
d_ex_court_05_113,This is madness!
d_ex_court_05_114,Privaty.
d_ex_court_05_115,"The law is an abstraction, whereas chocolate is something concrete."
d_ex_court_05_116,Wha..?!
d_ex_court_05_117,"If that's how you feel, why the hell did you come here in the first place?!"
d_ex_court_05_118,Get out of here!
d_ex_court_05_119,We are kicked out by a furious Privaty.
d_ex_court_05_120,"We stroll out of the courthouse happy as two clams, sharing some chocolate amongst ourselves."
d_ex_library_05_title,Counterfeit Cleverness
d_ex_library_05_1,*Zing*
d_ex_library_05_2,Teacher! This way!
d_ex_library_05_3,Why was it so important that I come to the library?
d_ex_library_05_4,I'm up to my ears in homework.
d_ex_library_05_5,You've gotta help me.
d_ex_library_05_6,Are you sure that's okay?
d_ex_library_05_7,"Rei, you're already in your third year. You should be doing this yourself."
d_ex_library_05_8,Why wouldn't it be? You're my teacher. Of course you can help me out with homework.
d_ex_library_05_9,"I know that, but..."
d_ex_library_05_10,I've been procrastinating.
d_ex_library_05_11,I don't think I can finish all this in time.
d_ex_library_05_12,"If I don't have all this done by tomorrow, they'll have me scrubbing toilets for a month."
d_ex_library_05_13,"So I'm begging you, help me!"
d_ex_library_05_14,What can I do to help?
d_ex_library_05_15,What is 7+7÷7+7x7-7?
d_ex_library_05_16,... 8?
d_ex_library_05_17,... 56?
d_ex_library_05_18,"Naru, is that correct?"
d_ex_library_05_19,Negative.
d_ex_library_05_20,...
d_ex_library_05_21,...
d_ex_library_05_22,Pssh... haha!
d_ex_library_05_23,"I thought I smelled an idiot in my vicinity, and there you are."
d_ex_library_05_24,... Noah?
d_ex_library_05_25,Why don't you move along?
d_ex_library_05_26,"Rei, let's find somewhere else to do your homework."
d_ex_library_05_27,Not a chance. I've got nowhere else to be.
d_ex_library_05_28,This place suits me just fine.
d_ex_library_05_29,"Besides, I was here first!"
d_ex_library_05_30,"I bet you didn't know that, you lunkhead."
d_ex_library_05_31,"Oh, what's this?"
d_ex_library_05_32,"Now you're avoiding me? You're not scared of me, are you?"
d_ex_library_05_33,I knew you were a coward.
d_ex_library_05_34,Nothing but a big chicken.
d_ex_library_05_35,"You think you're smarter than me, don't you?"
d_ex_library_05_36,Of course.
d_ex_library_05_37,And I'm heads and shoulders above this dork with the penguins.
d_ex_library_05_38,Those penguins don't seem too bright either.
d_ex_library_05_39,*Cry*
d_ex_library_05_40,*Scream*
d_ex_library_05_41,*Sob*
d_ex_library_05_42,Hey! Don't pick on Naru!
d_ex_library_05_43,Why do you think you're so smart?
d_ex_library_05_44,"I just told you, I'm smarter than you bunch of morons by a country mile."
d_ex_library_05_45,"Oh, sorry, I forgot to say it twice. I should have known I'd have to repeat myself for the simpletons."
d_ex_library_05_46,Why would you say that...
d_ex_library_05_47,*Cry*
d_ex_library_05_48,T-Teacher...！
d_ex_library_05_49,"If you cry, you're letting her win."
d_ex_library_05_50,"You're a big girl, so wipe away those tears."
d_ex_library_05_51,*Cry*
d_ex_library_05_52,"Unable to control her anger, Rei bursts into tears."
d_ex_library_05_53,"Jeez, the waterworks are kicking up already? What a crybaby."
d_ex_library_05_54,Tseetsee.
d_ex_library_05_55,You're mean!
d_ex_library_05_56,Enough. Both of you.
d_ex_library_05_57,"No, it's not enough."
d_ex_library_05_58,We're only getting started.
d_ex_library_05_59,"Besides, I don't have to listen to dreck like you two."
d_ex_library_05_60,You piece of...
d_ex_library_05_61,You motherf--
d_ex_library_05_62,"Teacher! You mustn't lose your temper! If you do, she wins."
d_ex_library_05_63,"Hee-hee, this is fun!"
d_ex_library_05_64,Do you know what 7+7÷7+7x7-7 comes out to by any chance?
d_ex_library_05_65,Of course!
d_ex_library_05_66,Anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows it's 50.
d_ex_library_05_67,"Is that right, Naru?"
d_ex_library_05_68,Correct.
d_ex_library_05_69,"Score a point for me, loser! How could you not know the answer to such a rudimentary question?"
d_ex_library_05_70,Hmmph!
d_ex_library_05_71,Teacher.
d_ex_library_05_72,Ask her some questions.
d_ex_library_05_73,...??
d_ex_library_05_74,I need to beat her.
d_ex_library_05_75,Are you sure you can do it?
d_ex_library_05_76,??
d_ex_library_05_77,"I know I can. I'm just not a math whiz, that's all."
d_ex_library_05_78,... If you say so.
d_ex_library_05_79,I'll ask some common sense questions.
d_ex_library_05_80,Let's see who's smarter.
d_ex_library_05_81,Is this really necessary?
d_ex_library_05_82,Me winning is a foregone conclusion at this point.
d_ex_library_05_83,... You wish.
d_ex_library_05_84,First question.
d_ex_library_05_85,"When you want to get something off your chest, you blow off some..."
d_ex_library_05_86,...
d_ex_library_05_87,...
d_ex_library_05_88,Really? No one?
d_ex_library_05_89,I thought you said these were going to be simple questions.
d_ex_library_05_90,"Yeah, don't be asking such asinine questions."
d_ex_library_05_91,... Fine.
d_ex_library_05_92,C02 is comprised of oxygen and...
d_ex_library_05_93,...
d_ex_library_05_94,...
d_ex_library_05_95,...??
d_ex_library_05_96,Neither of you knows that one either?
d_ex_library_05_97,Of course I know.
d_ex_library_05_98,I just wanted to give this dolt a fighting chance.
d_ex_library_05_99,"Y-yeah, me too!"
d_ex_library_05_100,"... Well, from here on out, if you know the answer, just say it."
d_ex_library_05_101,Let's try this one more time.
d_ex_library_05_102,How many kilograms are in a ton?
d_ex_library_05_103,...
d_ex_library_05_104,...
d_ex_library_05_105,"All right, we're done here."
d_ex_library_05_106,...
d_ex_library_05_107,...
d_ex_library_05_108,"And with that, the impromptu intellectual showdown comes to a sudden conclusion."
d_ex_workshop_05_title,Naru is All Yours
d_ex_workshop_05_1,Aaarrghhhh!
d_ex_workshop_05_2,N-Naru!
d_ex_workshop_05_3,Open your eyes!
d_ex_workshop_05_4,... They're open.
d_ex_workshop_05_5,Don't you die on me!
d_ex_workshop_05_6,We were supposed to be together forever... *Sob*
d_ex_workshop_05_7,I'll be nicer to you!
d_ex_workshop_05_8,I'll stop mooching off your snacks!
d_ex_workshop_05_9,You won't have to do my homework for me ever again!
d_ex_workshop_05_10,...
d_ex_workshop_05_11,"I head into the workshop,"
d_ex_workshop_05_12,only to find Rei bawling as she cradles Naru 1 in her arms.
d_ex_workshop_05_13,And...
d_ex_workshop_05_14,And...
d_ex_workshop_05_15,The toilets...
d_ex_workshop_05_16,... What about them?
d_ex_workshop_05_17,I'll scrub them myself!
d_ex_workshop_05_18,!!
d_ex_workshop_05_19,Rei... promise me...
d_ex_workshop_05_20,"I may be seeing things, but Naru 1's eyes seem to widen."
d_ex_workshop_05_21,So don't die...
d_ex_workshop_05_22,"Ready to go, initiating repairs!"
d_ex_workshop_05_23,"Wait, wait a minute! Naru and I haven't finished talking."
d_ex_workshop_05_24,What is going on here?
d_ex_workshop_05_25,"Oh, hey Boss!"
d_ex_workshop_05_26,Teacher!
d_ex_workshop_05_27,Naru is ill.
d_ex_workshop_05_28,What happened?
d_ex_workshop_05_29,I thought Naru was an android.
d_ex_workshop_05_30,Can't androids fall ill?
d_ex_workshop_05_31,"... Fine, what exactly is the issue?"
d_ex_workshop_05_32,He feels sluggish.
d_ex_workshop_05_33,He can barely open his mouth.
d_ex_workshop_05_34,His power keeps getting cut off.
d_ex_workshop_05_35,And he even gets heavier.
d_ex_workshop_05_36,... I see.
d_ex_workshop_05_37,"Centi, is Naru sick?"
d_ex_workshop_05_38,"I wouldn't say sick, more like broken."
d_ex_workshop_05_39,That's why I'm here to fix him.
d_ex_workshop_05_40,"Just some small repairs, nothing major."
d_ex_workshop_05_41,"Before I can do that though, I've got to shut down Naru's power."
d_ex_workshop_05_42,"Rei, goodbye."
d_ex_workshop_05_43,You make me... happy...
d_ex_workshop_05_44,"Naru, Naru!"
d_ex_workshop_05_45,*Beep*
d_ex_workshop_05_46,...
d_ex_workshop_05_47,Noooooooo!
d_ex_workshop_05_48,"Teacher, Naru isn't talking!"
d_ex_workshop_05_49,Of course he isn't. His power is off.
d_ex_workshop_05_50,I'll have him fixed in a jiffy!
d_ex_workshop_05_51,*Sizzle*
d_ex_workshop_05_52,*Click click*
d_ex_workshop_05_53,Centi opens Naru's back lid.
d_ex_workshop_05_54,*Click click*
d_ex_workshop_05_55,*Sizzle*
d_ex_workshop_05_56,*Beep*
d_ex_workshop_05_57,All done.
d_ex_workshop_05_58,The entire process takes less than a minute.
d_ex_workshop_05_59,All you did was change the battery...
d_ex_workshop_05_60,"Yep, just a basic procedure."
d_ex_workshop_05_61,What was wrong with him?
d_ex_workshop_05_62,Some laundry detergent had corroded her battery.
d_ex_workshop_05_63,"A bit of water seepage isn't an issue, since Naru's waterproof."
d_ex_workshop_05_64,"The same can't be said for chemicals, I'm afraid."
d_ex_workshop_05_65,So be careful!
d_ex_workshop_05_66,This happened because Rei always has Naru cleaning the toilets.
d_ex_workshop_05_67,*Beep*
d_ex_workshop_05_68,Retrieving signal.
d_ex_workshop_05_69,*Sizzle*
d_ex_workshop_05_70,Naru 1.
d_ex_workshop_05_71,Operation confirmed.
d_ex_workshop_05_72,Naru! Are you all right?
d_ex_workshop_05_73,I'm okay.
d_ex_workshop_05_74,Are you feeling better?
d_ex_workshop_05_75,Can you open your mouth now? Can you move?
d_ex_workshop_05_76,Perfectly.
d_ex_workshop_05_77,Whoo... Great.
d_ex_workshop_05_78,Rei.
d_ex_workshop_05_79,I am deeply moved.
d_ex_workshop_05_80,Naru is free.
d_ex_workshop_05_81,I'll never forget
d_ex_workshop_05_82,your promise to me.
d_ex_workshop_05_83,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_05_84,"Oh, right! That..."
d_ex_workshop_05_85,"Snacks, homework, toilets."
d_ex_workshop_05_86,You promised.
d_ex_workshop_05_87,"Sure, but... could I maybe have some of your snacks once in a while? About the homework..."
d_ex_workshop_05_88,*Beep*
d_ex_workshop_05_89,!!
d_ex_workshop_05_90,All right! Fine!
d_ex_workshop_05_91,I'll do as I promised!
d_ex_workshop_05_92,...
d_ex_workshop_05_93,Naru smiles gently.
d_ex_workshop_05_94,"Hee-hee. It's so good to see you're all right, Naru."
d_ex_workshop_05_95,"If you're feeling under the weather again, feel free to drop by."
d_ex_workshop_05_96,"Sure thing, thanks Centi."
d_ex_workshop_05_97,Naru and Rei skip merrily out of the workshop.
d_ex_armory_05_title,Combat Uniform
d_ex_armory_05_1,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_05_2,Excuse me.
d_ex_armory_05_3,Hey there.
d_ex_armory_05_4,Hmm?
d_ex_armory_05_5,What brings you two to the Armory?
d_ex_armory_05_6,I should be asking you the same question.
d_ex_armory_05_7,"The Absolute Squad was sent on a combat mission, and I've been tasked with watching over this place."
d_ex_armory_05_8,"Eunhwa said, and I quote, ""If any weirdoes show up, tell 'em to go pound sand."""
d_ex_armory_05_9,Those were her exact words?
d_ex_armory_05_10,Yep.
d_ex_armory_05_11,She specifically mentioned that if any Nikkes
d_ex_armory_05_12,"reeking of firepower or who had an air of an amateur detective to them showed up,"
d_ex_armory_05_13,"that I should tell them to get lost, by force if necessary."
d_ex_armory_05_14,... I see.
d_ex_armory_05_15,"Anyway,"
d_ex_armory_05_16,what you are two doing here?
d_ex_armory_05_17,We're hoping to get our hands on some bulletproof silk fabric.
d_ex_armory_05_18,That's quite an unusual combination.
d_ex_armory_05_19,The outfit I'm wearing is made of silk.
d_ex_armory_05_20,"It's beginning to fray slightly around the waist, so I wanted to get it patched up."
d_ex_armory_05_21,"I could always make a brand-new one, but I feel that'd be a bit overkill, considering it's only slightly torn in a few places."
d_ex_armory_05_22,Got it. Let me look it up for you.
d_ex_armory_05_23,A moment later.
d_ex_armory_05_24,"Sorry, but I didn't find any silk."
d_ex_armory_05_25,I did find some bulletproof cloth though. Do you want it?
d_ex_armory_05_26,"Thank you, but that's all right."
d_ex_armory_05_27,Sorry to trouble you.
d_ex_armory_05_28,I'll be on my way.
d_ex_armory_05_29,Wait a second.
d_ex_armory_05_30,"Actually, I know how to mend clothes."
d_ex_armory_05_31,... Really?
d_ex_armory_05_32,You do?
d_ex_armory_05_33,Sure. My combat uniform wears out sometimes when I've been doing a lot of training.
d_ex_armory_05_34,I always just mend it myself.
d_ex_armory_05_35,But this dress was made by the finest tailors. It could be a bit of a challenge.
d_ex_armory_05_36,"Don't worry, patching up a little hole like that is a piece of cake."
d_ex_armory_05_37,"Besides, that's what you wear out on the battlefield, isn't it?"
d_ex_armory_05_38,You can't be running around with any weak spots in your combat uniform.
d_ex_armory_05_39,... You have a point.
d_ex_armory_05_40,"Well... thank you, then."
d_ex_armory_05_41,Leave it to me.
d_ex_armory_05_42,A moment later.
d_ex_armory_05_43,"Delta crouches in front of Sakura, trying to repair her clothing."
d_ex_armory_05_44,... I didn't expect you were going to mend it with her still wearing it.
d_ex_armory_05_45,"It's not like I can ask her to drop trow in front of you, can I, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_ex_armory_05_46,I wouldn't mind...
d_ex_armory_05_47,...
d_ex_armory_05_48,"Not for now, at least."
d_ex_armory_05_49,"How's everything going, Delta?"
d_ex_armory_05_50,"It's a toughie, but I've got it under control."
d_ex_armory_05_51,Never thought I'd have my very own tailor.
d_ex_armory_05_52,"Say, Sakura."
d_ex_armory_05_53,Yeah?
d_ex_armory_05_54,I've noticed that you always fold your collar inward during battles.
d_ex_armory_05_55,Is there any special meaning to that?
d_ex_armory_05_56,"Wow, you're pretty sharp. I didn't think you'd notice."
d_ex_armory_05_57,"You've got eyes like an eagle, Commander. It's no wonder you're so good at sneaking a peek at girls' chests."
d_ex_armory_05_58,...
d_ex_armory_05_59,...
d_ex_armory_05_60,"... Anyway, back to the collar. So it does have a special meaning?"
d_ex_armory_05_61,"If you fold the collar inwards,"
d_ex_armory_05_62,it becomes a shroud.
d_ex_armory_05_63,You mean the cloth they use for dead people?
d_ex_armory_05_64,Yes.
d_ex_armory_05_65,Why would you want that?
d_ex_armory_05_66,"It's a bit awkward saying it out loud, but..."
d_ex_armory_05_67,"should I ever fall in battle, then I'll be all set."
d_ex_armory_05_68,All set? What do you mean?
d_ex_armory_05_69,"If I die in battle,"
d_ex_armory_05_70,it's not like I'll be able to pick out my outfit.
d_ex_armory_05_71,And the dead should not wear the clothing of the living.
d_ex_armory_05_72,That'd be a major breach of battlefield etiquette.
d_ex_armory_05_73,But then how is it okay for someone living to wear what dead people wear?
d_ex_armory_05_74,You could consider it a form of higher awareness.
d_ex_armory_05_75,It signifies that I am at peace with the possibility of dying in any given battle.
d_ex_armory_05_76,Er... I don't think I quite follow you.
d_ex_armory_05_77,"If I accept the fact I might die on the battlefield, I'm basically resigning myself to being killed. I'm admitting defeat before the battle's even begun."
d_ex_armory_05_78,Wouldn't it be better to focus on how to make it out alive?
d_ex_armory_05_79,"That's what I think, anyway. That's why I always inspect my weapons and equipment from top to bottom, including my combat uniform."
d_ex_armory_05_80,Because I want to come back alive.
d_ex_armory_05_81,That's a valid outlook as well.
d_ex_armory_05_82,But life is unpredictable. You can't have it all.
d_ex_armory_05_83,"So, you could consider my outlook as me merely preparing for the worst."
d_ex_armory_05_84,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_05_85,I think I can understand that.
d_ex_armory_05_86,"Okay, I'm done."
d_ex_armory_05_87,"Thanks, let me..."
d_ex_armory_05_88,...
d_ex_armory_05_89,The previous areas that were torn have been covered up with a hodge-podge of patches stacked atop each other.
d_ex_armory_05_90,"I can respect your concept of giving it your all in a fight,"
d_ex_armory_05_91,but I can't agree with accepting your own death before you've set foot on the battlefield.
d_ex_armory_05_92,"So, I stacked you up with four layers."
d_ex_armory_05_93,"That baby's capable of blocking the heaviest of artillery shells, so you won't be dying anytime soon."
d_ex_armory_05_94,Aren't you going a bit overboard?
d_ex_armory_05_95,...
d_ex_armory_05_96,Do you like it?
d_ex_armory_05_97,"Um... yes, I guess..."
d_ex_armory_05_98,Great.
d_ex_armory_05_99,Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.
d_ex_armory_05_100,... {AccountData.NickName}-kun?
d_ex_armory_05_101,Can you put your arm around my waist and walk with me?
d_ex_armory_05_102,It's because this patch that Delta so kindly made for me is so...
d_ex_armory_05_103,precious that I don't want just anyone to have the privilege of seeing it.
d_ex_armory_05_104,Gladly.
d_ex_gym_05_title,A Healthy Mind
d_ex_gym_05_1,Pit-Pit Boss...
d_ex_gym_05_2,Noir?
d_ex_gym_05_3,What are you doing at the gym?
d_ex_gym_05_4,I...
d_ex_gym_05_5,I want to...
d_ex_gym_05_6,become slim like Blanc.
d_ex_gym_05_7,I happened to see this flyer.
d_ex_gym_05_8,Noir holds up a flyer emblazoned with the words:
d_ex_gym_05_9,"""Slim Down In Only 30 Days!"""
d_ex_gym_05_10,"But, Noir..."
d_ex_gym_05_11,"I know, I know."
d_ex_gym_05_12,"After the 8th generation, you cannot change the shape you were originally assigned."
d_ex_gym_05_13,"Still,"
d_ex_gym_05_14,I want to at least try...
d_ex_gym_05_15,"Oh, hey Commander."
d_ex_gym_05_16,You here to get a workout in?
d_ex_gym_05_17,"Hey, Noir. First time I've seen you here."
d_ex_gym_05_18,"Hi, Privaty..."
d_ex_gym_05_19,"What you doing here, Privaty?"
d_ex_gym_05_20,Me?
d_ex_gym_05_21,"Why else would I be at the gym? To exercise, you dummy."
d_ex_gym_05_22,...
d_ex_gym_05_23,I've always been a gym rat...
d_ex_gym_05_24,*Whoosh*
d_ex_gym_05_25,A flyer falls from Privaty's hand and lands on the floor.
d_ex_gym_05_26,It is the same flyer that Noir was holding.
d_ex_gym_05_27,...
d_ex_gym_05_28,Um... that's not...
d_ex_gym_05_29,"Oh, fine! I was just curious to see if it was true!"
d_ex_gym_05_30,Seeing Noir and Privaty's behavior makes me feel like I should do something to help.
d_ex_gym_05_31,"All right then, why don't we all work out together?"
d_ex_gym_05_32,Huh?
d_ex_gym_05_33,You want to help us?
d_ex_gym_05_34,Thanks!
d_ex_gym_05_35,I'll give it my all!
d_ex_gym_05_36,So you're gonna be our personal trainer?
d_ex_gym_05_37,I guess I could imagine worse things.
d_ex_gym_05_38,"All right, looking forward to it."
d_ex_gym_05_39,"First up, we've got chest exercises."
d_ex_gym_05_40,Got it!
d_ex_gym_05_41,Let's do it.
d_ex_gym_05_42,"You puff out your chest, grab the bars on both ends, then bring them towards the center of your body."
d_ex_gym_05_43,Okay.
d_ex_gym_05_44,I'll try first.
d_ex_gym_05_45,Grab it like this...
d_ex_gym_05_46,Huff! Puff!
d_ex_gym_05_47,How's my posture?
d_ex_gym_05_48,Perfect.
d_ex_gym_05_49,Dang right!
d_ex_gym_05_50,I've got this exercise thing down pat.
d_ex_gym_05_51,"Noir, you try on the next machine."
d_ex_gym_05_52,"Okay,"
d_ex_gym_05_53,I'll try...
d_ex_gym_05_54,Huff...
d_ex_gym_05_55,Puff!
d_ex_gym_05_56,...
d_ex_gym_05_57,...
d_ex_gym_05_58,...
d_ex_gym_05_59,Um... Pit Boss...
d_ex_gym_05_60,"I can't bring it all the way to the center because of my... well, you know..."
d_ex_gym_05_61,I-is it okay if I bring it in this far?
d_ex_gym_05_62,"Due to an abundance of certain feminine assets, Noir was unable to pull the bars all the way to the center of her body."
d_ex_gym_05_63,...
d_ex_gym_05_64,How about we try another exercise?
d_ex_gym_05_65,"Okay, let's!"
d_ex_gym_05_66,Let's do push-ups.
d_ex_gym_05_67,"Lay down on the floor and spread your arms shoulder-width apart. Then, all you've got to do is push yourself up and down."
d_ex_gym_05_68,"You've got to keep your back straight, and not let yourself slump."
d_ex_gym_05_69,Understood.
d_ex_gym_05_70,While going down...
d_ex_gym_05_71,Like this?
d_ex_gym_05_72,"Nice posture, just like before."
d_ex_gym_05_73,Naturally.
d_ex_gym_05_74,I could rattle off 100 of these without breaking a sweat.
d_ex_gym_05_75,"Your turn, Noir."
d_ex_gym_05_76,Coming!
d_ex_gym_05_77,Lie down...
d_ex_gym_05_78,Spread your arms...
d_ex_gym_05_79,And go down...
d_ex_gym_05_80,"Oooo, that's cold!"
d_ex_gym_05_81,...
d_ex_gym_05_82,...
d_ex_gym_05_83,...
d_ex_gym_05_84,Um...
d_ex_gym_05_85,"my... er... my chest keeps hitting the ground first, and it's really cold."
d_ex_gym_05_86,Is it okay if I just go down this far?
d_ex_gym_05_87,... Moving on.
d_ex_gym_05_88,"This time, I decide to do leg presses, which have nothing to do with the chest."
d_ex_gym_05_89,Ha! This time you won't be able to pin the blame on those zeppelins of yours.
d_ex_gym_05_90,"Just sit back and watch, Noir."
d_ex_gym_05_91,Okay.
d_ex_gym_05_92,"Lean back like this,"
d_ex_gym_05_93,"then push using your legs, like so."
d_ex_gym_05_94,Wheeew! Wheeeew!
d_ex_gym_05_95,"You could get a job at a gym if you wanted, Privaty."
d_ex_gym_05_96,"Hehe, thanks, Commander."
d_ex_gym_05_97,Wheeew! Wheeeew!
d_ex_gym_05_98,"All right, Noir, put your back into it this time."
d_ex_gym_05_99,You got it!
d_ex_gym_05_100,Lean back...
d_ex_gym_05_101,Push with my legs...
d_ex_gym_05_102,... *Gasp*
d_ex_gym_05_103,Phew...
d_ex_gym_05_104,Urgh...!
d_ex_gym_05_105,Puff...
d_ex_gym_05_106,"Pit Boss,"
d_ex_gym_05_107,is this right?
d_ex_gym_05_108,I can't see my feet from this angle.
d_ex_gym_05_109,Ooof...
d_ex_gym_05_110,...
d_ex_gym_05_111,...
d_ex_gym_05_112,This is more complicated than I thought it would be.
d_ex_gym_05_113,"I'm sorry, Pit Boss,"
d_ex_gym_05_114,and Privaty...
d_ex_gym_05_115,"I'm just getting in the way, aren't I..."
d_ex_gym_05_116,"Erm... no, not at all!"
d_ex_gym_05_117,Although there are two very absurd reasons why you can't pull off these exercises...
d_ex_gym_05_118,...
d_ex_gym_05_119,"If we go on like this, Noir will lose what little confidence she has."
d_ex_gym_05_120,Surely there must be something...
d_ex_gym_05_121,...!!
d_ex_gym_05_122,"Noir, how about you try that?"
d_ex_gym_05_123,Huh?
d_ex_gym_05_124,You mean...
d_ex_gym_05_125,climbing up the rope?
d_ex_gym_05_126,"Right. You climb up the rope, touch the ceiling, and come back down."
d_ex_gym_05_127,It doesn't seem easy.
d_ex_gym_05_128,Hmm...
d_ex_gym_05_129,This looks way different than a sturdy pole.
d_ex_gym_05_130,... Fine.
d_ex_gym_05_131,I'll give it a shot.
d_ex_gym_05_132,I'll sit this one out.
d_ex_gym_05_133,Noir grips onto the rope with a look of determination.
d_ex_gym_05_134,Go-going up!
d_ex_gym_05_135,Noir grabs the rope in a familiar posture and starts to climb up.
d_ex_gym_05_136,...!
d_ex_gym_05_137,The rope shakes to and fro as Noir clambers up.
d_ex_gym_05_138,"You're almost there, Noir!"
d_ex_gym_05_139,You can do it!
d_ex_gym_05_140,Noir doesn't give up and keeps climbing.
d_ex_gym_05_141,Almost there...
d_ex_gym_05_142,Just a little more...
d_ex_gym_05_143,She's done it.
d_ex_gym_05_144,"Noir makes it all the way to the top of the rope, stretches out her hand, and touches the ceiling."
d_ex_gym_05_145,Wow!! Incredible!!
d_ex_gym_05_146,Very cool!!!
d_ex_gym_05_147,The sound of shouts and claps echoes through the gym.
d_ex_gym_05_148,Other gym-goers start to cheer Noir on for her achievement.
d_ex_gym_05_149,!!!
d_ex_gym_05_150,"Oh, um... hehe."
d_ex_gym_05_151,"Noir scampers down the rope, blushing."
d_ex_gym_05_152,Th-thanks everyone...
d_ex_gym_05_153,...
d_ex_gym_05_154,"So, what exercise should we do next?"
d_ex_gym_05_155,"Um, actually..."
d_ex_gym_05_156,I think I'm okay.
d_ex_gym_05_157,Are you sure?
d_ex_gym_05_158,Yeah.
d_ex_gym_05_159,I don't actually want to be like Blanc.
d_ex_gym_05_160,I just didn't have any confidence in myself.
d_ex_gym_05_161,"But, after all these exercises,"
d_ex_gym_05_162,I feel like I overcame a real hurdle.
d_ex_gym_05_163,"I feel healthier mentally, not just physically."
d_ex_gym_05_164,"Thank you, Pit Boss!"
d_ex_gym_05_165,"And you too, Privaty."
d_ex_gym_05_166,You taught me a lot as well.
d_ex_gym_05_167,I realized I'm not all that and a bag of chips.
d_ex_gym_05_168,Let's compete fair and square next time!
d_ex_gym_05_169,O-okay!
d_ex_gym_05_170,"I leave the gym together with Noir and Privaty, who both look relieved."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_title,Working the Pole
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_1,*Ring*
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_2,Hello?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_3,"Hmm, it's really dark..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_4,Is anyone there?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_5,Noir?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_6,Pit Boss?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_7,Is that you?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_8,"W-wait a moment, I'll be right in..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_9,*Boing*
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_10,Ow! That hurt...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_11,Ouch! My lovely lady lumps!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_12,Sorry about that.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_13,I wasn't paying attention.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_14,"I-it's okay, I couldn't see either because it's so dark."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_15,Actually...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_16,"... what are you doing here, Soda?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_17,"Oh, me?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_18,The club owner had me come in to clean.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_19,Apparently they're putting on a really cool show later tonight.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_20,"Once I'm done cleaning, I can stay and get a free show, hehe."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_21,People said it was a cool show?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_22,"What are you doing here now, anyway?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_23,This place isn't even open yet.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_24,I...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_25,I'm here to perform.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_26,No way!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_27,You're tonight's headliner?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_28,Sweet mamma jamma! This is gonna be so cool!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_29,"In that case, there's no time to be dilly-dallying."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_30,"Now that I know you're gonna be the one on stage,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_31,I've gotta get back to cleaning!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_32,"Soda, wait."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_33,Yes?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_34,"You didn't get those cleaning tools from here by any chance, did you?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_35,Soda is holding onto a long aluminum pole on which a mop head has been affixed.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_36,"Oh, this?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_37,"There weren't any cleaning tools around when I arrived,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_38,but then I saw this sturdy-looking pole stuck in the middle of the stage.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_39,So I attached a mop head to one end and got to cleaning.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_40,"I made it all by myself. Pretty resourceful, aren't I?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_41,Uh...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_42,Isn't it heavy?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_43,"Sure, it's a bit heftier than most mops, but"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_44,nothing I can't handle.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_45,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_46,"Noir, do you think that's..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_47,Yes.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_48,It's the pole I use for dancing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_49,"It was specially made to handle a Nikke's weight, so it must weigh an awful lot."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_50,It's incredible that you can use it as a mop!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_51,"Comments on Soda's strength aside, don't we need to put the pole back in its rightful place?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_52,Oh!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_53,That's right!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_54,Um... Soda.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_55,Yeah?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_56,"I'm sorry, but I use that for my pole dancing."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_57,"If it's okay with you, could we put it back where you found it?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_58,Huh?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_59,Wait a...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_60,Oh jeez!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_61,I'm sorry!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_62,I'll put it back right away!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_63,Wh--
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_64,Whoaaaa!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_65,*Crash*
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_66,"In her hurry to put the pole back, Soda trips over it and tumbles to the ground."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_67,Sorry about that...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_68,Did anyone get hurt?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_69,"No, we're okay."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_70,But the club...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_71,"As Soda fell, the unwieldy pole managed to hit just about everything in the immediate area, causing untold amounts of damage."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_72,Oh boy...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_73,I really stepped in it this time.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_74,What am I gonna do?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_75,"Don't worry, I'll help."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_76,Right. I'll help too.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_77,...!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_78,You two are lifesavers!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_79,Thank you so much!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_80,All three of us begin to clean frenetically.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_81,Soon after.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_82,Hmm...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_83,Weird.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_84,I thought I asked someone to clean the basement...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_85,Huh?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_86,You've got to be kidding.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_87,That's why there weren't any cleaning tools!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_88,"Yuni and I already cleaned up the first floor and the main hall,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_89,but we never get around to the basement.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_90,That's why I asked for help.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_91,Oh...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_92,Sorry...
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_93,"Having said that,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_94,this place is way cleaner than it was when we went over it.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_95,!!!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_96,Re-really?
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_97,Thanks.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_98,You can do the basement next time.
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_99,*Sob*
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_100,Thank you!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_101,"Good job, Soda."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_102,It's all thanks to you two!
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_103,"If you're free, you can watch the show before you leave."
d_ex_mysteryclub_05_104,"After watching Noir's show, our motley crew of impromptu cleaners parts ways."
d_ex_theater_06_title,Standing Up Is Torture
d_ex_theater_06_1,I visit the theater on Noir and Blanc's invitation.
d_ex_theater_06_2,Pit Boss!
d_ex_theater_06_3,Over here!
d_ex_theater_06_4,Y-you actually came?
d_ex_theater_06_5,Why'd you invite me over here?
d_ex_theater_06_6,Hmm...
d_ex_theater_06_7,Why do you think?
d_ex_theater_06_8,Take a guess.
d_ex_theater_06_9,Are you putting on a special performance just for me?
d_ex_theater_06_10,Oh my!
d_ex_theater_06_11,"Sis, I think Pit Boss was looking forward to a private show."
d_ex_theater_06_12,We'll have to keep that in mind for next time.
d_ex_theater_06_13,No doubt!
d_ex_theater_06_14,Looks like I was off the mark.
d_ex_theater_06_15,We've come up with a concept for our new dance.
d_ex_theater_06_16,"We're pretty happy with it, but"
d_ex_theater_06_17,something feels a bit off.
d_ex_theater_06_18,Would you...
d_ex_theater_06_19,take a look?
d_ex_theater_06_20,Of course.
d_ex_theater_06_21,Have a seat in the front row.
d_ex_theater_06_22,I sit in the middle of the first row.
d_ex_theater_06_23,The lights go off and a melody starts to play.
d_ex_theater_06_24,Noir and Blanc strut confidently to the center pole.
d_ex_theater_06_25,Both of them start to climb on the pole and dance.
d_ex_theater_06_26,After some time has passed...
d_ex_theater_06_27,"Noir, now!"
d_ex_theater_06_28,Got it!
d_ex_theater_06_29,"Suddenly, Blanc and Noir slide off the pole and head towards me."
d_ex_theater_06_30,"Pit Boss,"
d_ex_theater_06_31,give us your hand.
d_ex_theater_06_32,"As if under a spell, I offer my hand, and both of them pull me onto the stage."
d_ex_theater_06_33,They start dancing while using me as an impromptu pole.
d_ex_theater_06_34,...?!
d_ex_theater_06_35,"Looking at the two women seductively gyrating against me, my mind becomes hazy."
d_ex_theater_06_36,...
d_ex_theater_06_37,A moment later.
d_ex_theater_06_38,"Phew, that was hard!"
d_ex_theater_06_39,"You killed it, Blanc."
d_ex_theater_06_40,You too.
d_ex_theater_06_41,...
d_ex_theater_06_42,"So,"
d_ex_theater_06_43,"what'd you think, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_theater_06_44,We want a performance where we can involve the audience.
d_ex_theater_06_45,"They want to meet us so badly, but they're always so far below the stage."
d_ex_theater_06_46,We thought this would make a nice memory for a lucky fan.
d_ex_theater_06_47,"Of course, there are limits to what we'll do for our fans, but"
d_ex_theater_06_48,I think they'll enjoy it.
d_ex_theater_06_49,Hmm...
d_ex_theater_06_50,Did you not like it?
d_ex_theater_06_51,We couldn't actually do it in real life so we kept practicing on ourselves.
d_ex_theater_06_52,We thought it'd work really well...
d_ex_theater_06_53,Was it not good?
d_ex_theater_06_54,The performance itself was good.
d_ex_theater_06_55,Really? You think so?
d_ex_theater_06_56,But there's something missing.
d_ex_theater_06_57,What is it?
d_ex_theater_06_58,I think there should be a chair for me to sit on.
d_ex_theater_06_59,A chair?
d_ex_theater_06_60,"Ah, were you uncomfortable from all the standing?"
d_ex_theater_06_61,Or was it hard to keep your balance because we were holding onto you?
d_ex_theater_06_62,"Yeah, that must be it!"
d_ex_theater_06_63,"That's part of it, but..."
d_ex_theater_06_64,Was there something else that made you uncomfortable?
d_ex_theater_06_65,"Please, be honest with us!"
d_ex_theater_06_66,...
d_ex_theater_06_67,Standing upright is... not ideal for a man.
d_ex_theater_06_68,I think everything would be peachy as long as there is a chair.
d_ex_theater_06_69,Really?
d_ex_theater_06_70,I think I understand.
d_ex_theater_06_71,So you think the audience members will appreciate it?
d_ex_theater_06_72,You think they'd feel awkward without it?
d_ex_theater_06_73,Very much so.
d_ex_theater_06_74,V-very...?!
d_ex_theater_06_75,Do you think it'd be bad enough that we shouldn't do it on stage?
d_ex_theater_06_76,What if we take out all the touching?
d_ex_theater_06_77,Maybe that will make them feel slightly less agitated.
d_ex_theater_06_78,"Actually, knowing that we can look, but not touch only makes you more desirable."
d_ex_theater_06_79,Ha!
d_ex_theater_06_80,So... how about we make this a private show?
d_ex_theater_06_81,Are you sure you won't find it too disagreeable?
d_ex_theater_06_82,"Trust me, I'm into it."
d_ex_theater_06_83,I just don't think you can do this sort of thing with a mass audience.
d_ex_theater_06_84,I-I see...
d_ex_theater_06_85,"Well, at any rate, I'm glad you enjoyed it."
d_ex_theater_06_86,"Then let's make this a private show, for your eyes only!"
d_ex_theater_06_87,Yeah!
d_ex_theater_06_88,That's a good idea.
d_ex_theater_06_89,"In that case, should we practice a bit more?"
d_ex_theater_06_90,"Yes, let's continue."
d_ex_theater_06_91,"Do you have time to keep helping us, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_theater_06_92,"For this, I've got all the time in the world."
d_ex_theater_06_93,Thanks!
d_ex_theater_06_94,I'll go find a chair.
d_ex_theater_06_95,I have a fun time testing my resolve while helping Blanc and Noir practice their dance.

d_ex_command_06_5,Also because we've got something to tell you!
d_ex_command_06_6,Something to tell me?
d_ex_command_06_7,Yep!
d_ex_command_06_8,"We like you, Pit Boss."
d_ex_command_06_9,"Not just as our superior, but really, honest-to-goodness like you."
d_ex_command_06_10,"Thanks to you,"
d_ex_command_06_11,I've learned what it means to be fond of someone.
d_ex_command_06_12,What's going on here?
d_ex_command_06_13,"So,"
d_ex_command_06_14,do you feel the same way about us?
d_ex_command_06_15,Do I...?
d_ex_command_06_16,C'mon!
d_ex_command_06_17,"We just confessed how we feel about you, Pit Boss."
d_ex_command_06_18,Don't you feel the same way about us?
d_ex_command_06_19,Hold up a minute.
d_ex_command_06_20,You're not making sense right now.
d_ex_command_06_21,Huh?
d_ex_command_06_22,Which part doesn't make sense?
d_ex_command_06_23,"If you don't like us,"
d_ex_command_06_24,or if we've made you uncomfortable...
d_ex_command_06_25,That's not it.
d_ex_command_06_26,Are you sure it's okay if I'm into both of you at the same time?
d_ex_command_06_27,Isn't this whole arrangement kind of frowned upon?
d_ex_command_06_28,Of course!
d_ex_command_06_29,"If you like me, then you'll obviously fancy Noir as well."
d_ex_command_06_30,And vice versa.
d_ex_command_06_31,Duh!
d_ex_command_06_32,According to who?
d_ex_command_06_33,Who cares what society thinks of us?
d_ex_command_06_34,"We like you, so what's wrong with you liking us back?"
d_ex_command_06_35,Don't worry about what other people think.
d_ex_command_06_36,...
d_ex_command_06_37,Well?
d_ex_command_06_38,"What's it gonna be, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_command_06_39,Fine. I like you both as well.
d_ex_command_06_40,...!
d_ex_command_06_41,Woohoo!
d_ex_command_06_42,"So, what happens next?"
d_ex_command_06_43,What happens next is that the three of us
d_ex_command_06_44,live happily ever after.
d_ex_command_06_45,Um...
d_ex_command_06_46,Th-there was something I wanted to do if the three of us all felt the same way about each other.
d_ex_command_06_47,And what's that?
d_ex_command_06_48,Noir and Blanc each lock onto one of my arms.
d_ex_command_06_49,A luck...
d_ex_command_06_50,recharge!
d_ex_command_06_51,I thought you could do that just by holding hands.
d_ex_command_06_52,Although I suppose we're doing that as well...
d_ex_command_06_53,"No, that won't suffice anymore."
d_ex_command_06_54,"The three of us are one now,"
d_ex_command_06_55,so just holding hands won't cut the mustard.
d_ex_command_06_56,We've gotta take it to the next level.
d_ex_command_06_57,"Yeah, something more intense."
d_ex_command_06_58,We'll teach you.
d_ex_command_06_59,"Noir and I have been wanting to do this with you for a while,"
d_ex_command_06_60,so we practiced really hard.
d_ex_command_06_61,It'll probably be comfortable if we all lie down on the bed.
d_ex_command_06_62,Noir and Blanc lead me toward the bed.
d_ex_command_06_63,"Now, spread your fingers like this..."
d_ex_command_06_64,"Wowee, you've got big hands, Pit Boss. Your fingers are super long, too."
d_ex_command_06_65,That'll help with the recharge.
d_ex_command_06_66,"Now, just put your hand here on Noir."
d_ex_command_06_67,That's it!
d_ex_command_06_68,J-just not so tight...
d_ex_command_06_69,Sorry.
d_ex_command_06_70,"As for your other hand, that'll go here, on me."
d_ex_command_06_71,Gently now.
d_ex_command_06_72,Right here.
d_ex_command_06_73,That's the spot.
d_ex_command_06_74,You're a natural at this.
d_ex_command_06_75,"Now, if I do it gently like so..."
d_ex_command_06_76,...!!
d_ex_command_06_77,It hurts a little.
d_ex_command_06_78,Sssh!
d_ex_command_06_79,Everything that happens here is our little secret.
d_ex_command_06_80,"Kept between you, me, and Noir."
d_ex_command_06_81,"So,"
d_ex_command_06_82,you've got to keep quiet.
d_ex_command_06_83,It'll only complicate things if someone from outside hears.
d_ex_command_06_84,Noir and I will keep our voices down as well.
d_ex_command_06_85,"Now, let's top you up for real this time."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_title,Vesti's Lucky Friend
d_ex_maidcafe_04_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_maidcafe_04_2,We-welcome.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_3,Vesti?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_4,Commander?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_5,What are you doing in the Maid Cafe?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_6,I-I work here.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_7,You're telling me you work at the café?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_8,"Yeah. This place has a lot of customers,"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_9,and I hear it's easy to talk to people and make friends.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_10,So I asked Ade if I could work here for a day.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_11,So have you made any friends?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_12,Not yet...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_13,"Actually, you're our first customer."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_14,It's been dead today.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_15,"Cocoa and Ade went out on business, and Soda is cleaning."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_16,I see.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_17,"Actually, I think it's great that we don't have any customers."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_18,Why?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_19,Because I wouldn't know what to do if we did have them.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_20,"Just the thought of it makes my mind go blank, and I break out in a cold sweat."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_21,Maybe I should just give up...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_22,Let me help you.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_23,C-Commander?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_24,B-but how you plan on...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_25,*Jingle*
d_ex_maidcafe_04_26,"Oh jeez, a customer!"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_27,Just calm down and greet them.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_28,Okay...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_29,W-welcome!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_30,Vesti? Pit Boss?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_31,Blanc?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_32,Fancy meeting you two here.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_33,"Blanc enters the Maid Cafe, eyeballing the surroundings curiously."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_34,"While Blanc isn't paying attention, I lean over to Vesti and whisper in her ear:"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_35,Vesti.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_36,Try making friends with Blanc.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_37,With Blanc?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_38,"She's a customer, isn't she?"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_39,I guess you're right...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_40,"This place is usually packed to the gills, so I always steered clear of it."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_41,Seems like today's an exception.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_42,Where do I order?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_43,O-over here!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_44,Huh? Since when did you start working here?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_45,Uh... I... Well...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_46,She's only here for the day.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_47,...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_48,"Fair enough. Well, what do you recommend?"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_49,Ah...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_50,Um...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_51,Vesti finds herself tongue-tied as Blanc peruses the menu.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_52,"She'll be there all day, stammering, unless I do something."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_53,Recommend something on the menu.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_54,Ask Blanc if you can help her come to a decision.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_55,A recommendation...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_56,...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_57,Um... can I help you with anything?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_58,"Oh, I'm just not sure whether I want a parfait or a drink."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_59,The parfait here is delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_60,I personally think the strawberry ice cream is the best flavor.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_61,"Much better than the vanilla, I think."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_62,Oh! And it goes wonderfully with some chocolate syrup drizzled on top.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_63,"Yeah? I'll have that, then."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_64,Y-you will?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_65,"Why not? Since you give it such a glowing recommendation, I've gotta try it."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_66,Okay! I'll have Soda start preparing your order.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_67,...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_68,"Thanks, Commander!"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_69,Vesti whispers to me.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_70,A while later.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_71,"Here's your parfait, enjoy."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_72,"Well, it certainly looks delicious. Time to dig in!"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_73,...!!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_74,"Blanc takes a bite of the parfait, and her eyes widen."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_75,Do you like it?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_76,I love it!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_77,!!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_78,You do?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_79,"Yes! In fact, this is the best parfait I've ever had."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_80,No kidding?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_81,"You want a bite, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_82,Sure.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_83,I take a bite. It's...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_84,Absolutely delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_85,Told you.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_86,"How did you come up with this flavor combination, Vesti?"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_87,"Whenever I came here with Emma, I could never decide between strawberry or chocolate."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_88,"When I was deliberating, Emma told me, ""Why not combine the two?""."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_89,"I followed her suggestion,"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_90,and I found it delicious!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_91,So I order this every time I come here.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_92,They should have this on the menu. I'm gonna recommend this to Noir.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_93,I'm glad you like it!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_94,You got any other recommendations?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_95,Noir and I can try it out the next time we come here.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_96,"After the parfait, I think the omurice is a close second."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_97,The way they prepare it is very unique.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_98,Is it the kind with the ketchup drizzled on top?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_99,That's it!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_100,I'm a sucker for that stuff.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_101,It sounds like we have similar tastes.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_102,"Sure does. Have you ever tried fried rice, by any chance?"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_103,"No, I haven't."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_104,"Oh man, you can't beat it. Next time..."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_105,"Vesti and Blanc proceed to have a natural, free-flowing conversation."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_106,A few minutes later.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_107,Why does it feel like someone is watching me...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_108,Pit Boss? What are you laughing at?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_109,Nothing. It's just nice to see you two becoming such fast friends.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_110,F-friends?
d_ex_maidcafe_04_111,You two are chatting like a pair of old friends.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_112,"Well, if the shoe fits... let's be friends, starting today!"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_113,...!!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_114,O-okay!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_115,"Next time, you can come to Coin Rush."
d_ex_maidcafe_04_116,Noir and I will show you a good time.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_117,Sounds great!
d_ex_maidcafe_04_118,"Well, this was fun,"
d_ex_maidcafe_04_119,but I've got to meet up with Noir.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_120,See you around.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_121,Blanc leaves the Maid Cafe in a hurry.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_122,How strange...
d_ex_maidcafe_04_123,I felt like I could say whatever came to my mind in front of Blanc.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_124,I think that... we can be good friends.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_125,I feel the same way.
d_ex_maidcafe_04_126,"Vesti gazes at the door of the café from which Blanc just departed, a bashful smile spreading across her face."
d_ex_modernbar_05_title,No Fear of Failure
d_ex_modernbar_05_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_modernbar_05_2,"As I walk into the bar, I see Pepper and Blanc sitting together, drinking."
d_ex_modernbar_05_3,"Hey, Commander."
d_ex_modernbar_05_4,Pit Boss?
d_ex_modernbar_05_5,Why are you...?
d_ex_modernbar_05_6,"If you don't mind, Blanc, I'm the one who called him over."
d_ex_modernbar_05_7,"If you're feeling blue, I think the Commander might be able to help you more than a doctor. That's not to say that a doctor is useless..."
d_ex_modernbar_05_8,...
d_ex_modernbar_05_9,What happened?
d_ex_modernbar_05_10,"Oh, it's nothing!"
d_ex_modernbar_05_11,"Blanc, what did I tell you? You have to speak up whenever you're having trouble."
d_ex_modernbar_05_12,It's not healthy to keep everything bottled up inside.
d_ex_modernbar_05_13,There's no need for any forced smiles.
d_ex_modernbar_05_14,No one can be happy 24/7.
d_ex_modernbar_05_15,...
d_ex_modernbar_05_16,I guess you're right...
d_ex_modernbar_05_17,What on earth is going on?
d_ex_modernbar_05_18,Did you get dumped?
d_ex_modernbar_05_19,Did you and Noir have a tiff?
d_ex_modernbar_05_20,What? No!
d_ex_modernbar_05_21,Who in their right mind would ever dump me?
d_ex_modernbar_05_22,Right... how silly of me to assume.
d_ex_modernbar_05_23,It's not that!
d_ex_modernbar_05_24,Hell would freeze over before Noir and I got into a shouting match.
d_ex_modernbar_05_25,"If you must know,"
d_ex_modernbar_05_26,I made a mistake during today's rehearsal.
d_ex_modernbar_05_27,We've got a big show coming up tomorrow.
d_ex_modernbar_05_28,"You, make a mistake? I don't believe it."
d_ex_modernbar_05_29,Everyone makes mistakes.
d_ex_modernbar_05_30,Commander.
d_ex_modernbar_05_31,Everyone makes mistakes.
d_ex_modernbar_05_32,Do you perhaps think that you're overreacting?
d_ex_modernbar_05_33,Sorry...
d_ex_modernbar_05_34,That's exactly what I've been trying to tell her.
d_ex_modernbar_05_35,Everyone makes mistakes.
d_ex_modernbar_05_36,"It was just a rehearsal, wasn't it?"
d_ex_modernbar_05_37,"Yes, but"
d_ex_modernbar_05_38,that was the first time I've ever made a mistake. I can't get over it!
d_ex_modernbar_05_39,"What happened, exactly?"
d_ex_modernbar_05_40,I have to whirl around while I'm at the top of the pole.
d_ex_modernbar_05_41,"It's supposed to be the grand finale, but I keep screwing up."
d_ex_modernbar_05_42,I always slip right off the pole!
d_ex_modernbar_05_43,"No matter how many times I try,"
d_ex_modernbar_05_44,I keep falling off at the same spot.
d_ex_modernbar_05_45,The big show is tomorrow.
d_ex_modernbar_05_46,"I didn't have any problems before, and now I can't pull it off to save my life. I can't believe this!"
d_ex_modernbar_05_47,People often make mistakes with things
d_ex_modernbar_05_48,they feel they're proficient in.
d_ex_modernbar_05_49,What good does that do me?
d_ex_modernbar_05_50,I've got to do better tomorrow.
d_ex_modernbar_05_51,I have to!
d_ex_modernbar_05_52,...
d_ex_modernbar_05_53,Why don't you try again in here?
d_ex_modernbar_05_54,... Huh? In here?
d_ex_modernbar_05_55,Sure. There's a pole right over there.
d_ex_modernbar_05_56,Good idea! Why don't you give it a try?
d_ex_modernbar_05_57,"I think you're so worried about making a mistake,"
d_ex_modernbar_05_58,that you're psyching yourself out.
d_ex_modernbar_05_59,Just relax and don't think about it too much.
d_ex_modernbar_05_60,...
d_ex_modernbar_05_61,... Got it!
d_ex_modernbar_05_62,Blanc walks to the front of the stage.
d_ex_modernbar_05_63,Phew...
d_ex_modernbar_05_64,All right.
d_ex_modernbar_05_65,Blanc begins to climb up the pole.
d_ex_modernbar_05_66,So far so good. Her performance is flawless.
d_ex_modernbar_05_67,...
d_ex_modernbar_05_68,... This is the part.
d_ex_modernbar_05_69,*Whew*
d_ex_modernbar_05_70,!!
d_ex_modernbar_05_71,Arrghh!
d_ex_modernbar_05_72,*Clap*
d_ex_modernbar_05_73,"Although Blanc almost slips off, she manages to grab the pole quickly with both of her hands."
d_ex_modernbar_05_74,*Whew*
d_ex_modernbar_05_75,*Whew*
d_ex_modernbar_05_76,"She successfully completes the finishing move, herself and the pole united as one."
d_ex_modernbar_05_77,Wow... awesome.
d_ex_modernbar_05_78,You've got that right.
d_ex_modernbar_05_79,I made it!
d_ex_modernbar_05_80,I couldn't do it before!
d_ex_modernbar_05_81,You did great!
d_ex_modernbar_05_82,"What matters most is that you didn't run away from your fears. Instead, you faced them head on."
d_ex_modernbar_05_83,"If you'd kept evading it out of fear, you'd have never gotten past this stumbling block."
d_ex_modernbar_05_84,"Thanks, you guys."
d_ex_modernbar_05_85,I think tomorrow's show is gonna do gangbusters!
d_ex_modernbar_05_86,I'm sure it will.
d_ex_modernbar_05_87,Thanks again for all the help.
d_ex_modernbar_05_88,Don't mention it.
d_ex_modernbar_05_89,"After all, what are doctors for?"
d_ex_modernbar_05_90,Although I would like to reiterate:
d_ex_modernbar_05_91,"Whenever you're upset about something, just say so."
d_ex_modernbar_05_92,The same goes for when you're feeling sad.
d_ex_modernbar_05_93,"To confide in others is the bravest thing of all. If you keep everything to yourself, no one will ever know how much you're struggling."
d_ex_modernbar_05_94,*Buzz*
d_ex_modernbar_05_95,Looks like I've got a patient waiting for me. Gotta go.
d_ex_modernbar_05_96,"The Commander and I can't wait to check out your show tomorrow, Blanc."
d_ex_modernbar_05_97,Nicely done today.
d_ex_modernbar_05_98,Okay! Noir and I will be sure to put on a killer show for you guys.
d_ex_modernbar_05_99,Peppers leaves the bar in a hurry.
d_ex_modernbar_05_100,Feeling better?
d_ex_modernbar_05_101,Yep! Thanks to you.
d_ex_modernbar_05_102,"If I had bungled that move again,"
d_ex_modernbar_05_103,I'd have had to change the movements or ask Noir for help.
d_ex_modernbar_05_104,I'm glad you pulled it off.
d_ex_modernbar_05_105,Heh-heh.
d_ex_modernbar_05_106,Aya!
d_ex_modernbar_05_107,Blanc leaps out of her chair.
d_ex_modernbar_05_108,I can't believe I let my emotions get the best of me.
d_ex_modernbar_05_109,I've gotta work hard for this upcoming show.
d_ex_modernbar_05_110,I was just a bit nervous since I'd never experienced anything like that before.
d_ex_modernbar_05_111,You and Pepper really saved my skin.
d_ex_modernbar_05_112,"Noir has been worried sick, even though I told her not to. I've gotta get back and tell her that I'm all better."
d_ex_modernbar_05_113,But before I go...
d_ex_modernbar_05_114,*Kiss*
d_ex_modernbar_05_115,!!
d_ex_modernbar_05_116,A small thank-you for listening to my troubles.
d_ex_modernbar_05_117,"Go get 'em, tiger."
d_ex_modernbar_05_118,You betcha.
d_ex_modernbar_05_119,Don't forget to come to the show tomorrow. I'll be more motivated knowing you're there.
d_ex_modernbar_05_120,Wouldn't miss it for the world.
d_ex_modernbar_05_121,"Blanc heads out of the bar, beaming from ear to ear."
d_ex_modernbar_05_122,"The next day, Blanc's show is a resounding success, garnering widespread critical acclaim."
d_ex_shopping_06_title,Lucky Elevator
d_ex_shopping_06_1,"After listening to Yan's long-winded sales pitch, I'm about to be late for another meeting."
d_ex_shopping_06_2,10 minutes until the meeting. I won't be late so long there aren't any problems with the elevator.
d_ex_shopping_06_3,*Beep*
d_ex_shopping_06_4,"For whatever reason, the elevator is running slow as molasses."
d_ex_shopping_06_5,*Tink*
d_ex_shopping_06_6,"After a few feeble lurches, it stops entirely."
d_ex_shopping_06_7,*Beep*
d_ex_shopping_06_8,"Where are you headed, Commander?"
d_ex_shopping_06_9,Off to a meeting.
d_ex_shopping_06_10,I see. You're so hard-working!
d_ex_shopping_06_11,... Are you coming in or not?
d_ex_shopping_06_12,Just a moment.
d_ex_shopping_06_13,We've gotta wait for Brid.
d_ex_shopping_06_14,...
d_ex_shopping_06_15,The proceeding 10 seconds feel like an hour.
d_ex_shopping_06_16,"I'm in a bit of a hurry, so maybe you could take the next one?"
d_ex_shopping_06_17,Sorry.
d_ex_shopping_06_18,I had to fetch something.
d_ex_shopping_06_19,... It's all right.
d_ex_shopping_06_20,Everybody good to go?
d_ex_shopping_06_21,*Clack clack clack*
d_ex_shopping_06_22,"Commander, you're gonna end up breaking the button if you keep pressing it so hard."
d_ex_shopping_06_23,"I told you, I'm very pressed for time."
d_ex_shopping_06_24,*Buzz* *Clack*
d_ex_shopping_06_25,!!
d_ex_shopping_06_26,"Just as they are about to close, a hand reaches through the seam in the doors."
d_ex_shopping_06_27,Whoo...
d_ex_shopping_06_28,Excuse me.
d_ex_shopping_06_29,Drake?
d_ex_shopping_06_30,You doofus!
d_ex_shopping_06_31,Are you blind? How did you not see me coming?
d_ex_shopping_06_32,"Sorry, I was in a rush."
d_ex_shopping_06_33,... Fine.
d_ex_shopping_06_34,Come on in.
d_ex_shopping_06_35,Thanks.
d_ex_shopping_06_36,"Wait, is this going up?"
d_ex_shopping_06_37,"No, it's going down."
d_ex_shopping_06_38,Nuts!
d_ex_shopping_06_39,Wrong elevator.
d_ex_shopping_06_40,I'll get off on the next floor.
d_ex_shopping_06_41,"Wait, this elevator is going down?"
d_ex_shopping_06_42,"I think we took the wrong one, Brid."
d_ex_shopping_06_43,"Let's get off with Drake, then."
d_ex_shopping_06_44,*Sigh*
d_ex_shopping_06_45,*Tink*
d_ex_shopping_06_46,"See you, Commander. Good luck with your meeting!"
d_ex_shopping_06_47,...Thanks.
d_ex_shopping_06_48,5 minutes left.
d_ex_shopping_06_49,"I'm still in the clear, so long as nobody else gets on."
d_ex_shopping_06_50,*Tink*
d_ex_shopping_06_51,*Collapse*
d_ex_shopping_06_52,*Buzz*
d_ex_shopping_06_53,Huh?
d_ex_shopping_06_54,Master? How come you're kneeling down? Are you praying or something?
d_ex_shopping_06_55,"No... just felt a bit overwhelmed, that's all."
d_ex_shopping_06_56,"Don't push yourself too hard, now."
d_ex_shopping_06_57,Let me help you...
d_ex_shopping_06_58,*Collapse*
d_ex_shopping_06_59,Whoops! Sorry...
d_ex_shopping_06_60,"As Soda steps into the elevator,"
d_ex_shopping_06_61,she stumbles and gets her leg caught in the doors.
d_ex_shopping_06_62,Stand up first.
d_ex_shopping_06_63,??
d_ex_shopping_06_64,"Hmm? Master, something touches my breasts... What is this?"
d_ex_shopping_06_65,"Take care, and stand up slowly."
d_ex_shopping_06_66,A while later
d_ex_shopping_06_67,"Although another unexpected tangent has occurred, I've still got 3 minutes."
d_ex_shopping_06_68,"Not a lot of wiggle room, but enough so that I may still make it."
d_ex_shopping_06_69,*Tink*
d_ex_shopping_06_70,...
d_ex_shopping_06_71,*Buzz*
d_ex_shopping_06_72,Pit Boss?
d_ex_shopping_06_73,Where are you going?
d_ex_shopping_06_74,To a meeting.
d_ex_shopping_06_75,You don't look so good...
d_ex_shopping_06_76,What happened?
d_ex_shopping_06_77,"Nothing. I'm just going to be late, that's all."
d_ex_shopping_06_78,When does the meeting start?
d_ex_shopping_06_79,In three minutes.
d_ex_shopping_06_80,Yikes!
d_ex_shopping_06_81,"If you make a mad dash once you get off the elevator, you may still make it."
d_ex_shopping_06_82,There's still some time.
d_ex_shopping_06_83,"If it helps, you can think of it as 180 seconds."
d_ex_shopping_06_84,*Buzz* *Beep*
d_ex_shopping_06_85,"Once Blanc gets on, the elevator continues to go down."
d_ex_shopping_06_86,...
d_ex_shopping_06_87,It goes straight down without stopping at any floors along the way.
d_ex_shopping_06_88,The elevators in the mall
d_ex_shopping_06_89,are always so fast.
d_ex_shopping_06_90,Says you.
d_ex_shopping_06_91,What do you mean?
d_ex_shopping_06_92,"They're agonizingly slow, since so many people have to take them."
d_ex_shopping_06_93,Really?
d_ex_shopping_06_94,That hasn't been my experience.
d_ex_shopping_06_95,"Actually, this is the first time I've ever had someone else in the elevator with me."
d_ex_shopping_06_96,Sometimes I feel like
d_ex_shopping_06_97,I've got the elevators all to myself!
d_ex_shopping_06_98,...
d_ex_shopping_06_99,"The moment Blanc steps onto the elevator,"
d_ex_shopping_06_100,it goes straight down to the ground floor without stopping.
d_ex_shopping_06_101,*Tink*
d_ex_shopping_06_102,"See, wasn't that quick?"
d_ex_shopping_06_103,"In fact,"
d_ex_shopping_06_104,this might just be one of the fastest elevators I've ever taken!
d_ex_shopping_06_105,"See you later, Pit Boss!"
d_ex_shopping_06_106,Blanc gets off the elevator and slowly saunters off.
d_ex_shopping_06_107,*Buzz*
d_ex_shopping_06_108,... What just happened?
d_ex_shopping_06_109,"Just then, I get a message saying that the meeting has been canceled for unrelated reasons."
d_ex_observationpost_05_title,The Signal of Betrayal
d_ex_observationpost_05_1,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_05_2,"Commander, you're here!"
d_ex_observationpost_05_3,Do you still need me to survey the ground for you today?
d_ex_observationpost_05_4,"Yes, please."
d_ex_observationpost_05_5,All right. Please take a seat!
d_ex_observationpost_05_6,Signal begins to watch the observer's screen.
d_ex_observationpost_05_7,... Huh?
d_ex_observationpost_05_8,What's this?
d_ex_observationpost_05_9,What's wrong?
d_ex_observationpost_05_10,"Commander, there is a suspicious signal."
d_ex_observationpost_05_11,"Hearing Signal, I turn to the screen."
d_ex_observationpost_05_12,A red circle with a question mark is moving slowly.
d_ex_observationpost_05_13,What does the question mark mean?
d_ex_observationpost_05_14,Signals with unknown sources are labeled with a question mark.
d_ex_observationpost_05_15,But I have never seen one before...
d_ex_observationpost_05_16,This is a bit scary.
d_ex_observationpost_05_17,"To be safe, I should report..."
d_ex_observationpost_05_18,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_05_19,Huh...?
d_ex_observationpost_05_20,"Hello, Signal."
d_ex_observationpost_05_21,You're still as petite and cute as ever.
d_ex_observationpost_05_22,"H-hello, Rosanna!"
d_ex_observationpost_05_23,Rosanna?
d_ex_observationpost_05_24,"Mister, you're also here."
d_ex_observationpost_05_25,This is perfect.
d_ex_observationpost_05_26,May I use the observer for a while?
d_ex_observationpost_05_27,I want to confirm something.
d_ex_observationpost_05_28,"Sure, but..."
d_ex_observationpost_05_29,"I discovered a suspicious signal, so I might have to confirm it first."
d_ex_observationpost_05_30,Wow.
d_ex_observationpost_05_31,May I take a look at it?
d_ex_observationpost_05_32,It might be related to what I want to confirm.
d_ex_observationpost_05_33,T-then...
d_ex_observationpost_05_34,Signal seems to be asking for my permission.
d_ex_observationpost_05_35,Go ahead.
d_ex_observationpost_05_36,Thank you.
d_ex_observationpost_05_37,...
d_ex_observationpost_05_38,Aha. So he's there.
d_ex_observationpost_05_39,"OK, I'm done."
d_ex_observationpost_05_40,Do you know what that signal is?
d_ex_observationpost_05_41,Of course.
d_ex_observationpost_05_42,It's the signal of Hedonia's traitor.
d_ex_observationpost_05_43,There's such a signal?
d_ex_observationpost_05_44,I... I never knew.
d_ex_observationpost_05_45,"Oh, it didn't always exist."
d_ex_observationpost_05_46,I planted a tracker on him because I was suspicious.
d_ex_observationpost_05_47,But the signal was suddenly gone today.
d_ex_observationpost_05_48,"I should receive an error report if the tracker malfunctions or is damaged, but I didn't."
d_ex_observationpost_05_49,"Then I found out he seems to have gone to the surface, so I came here to check."
d_ex_observationpost_05_50,Turns out he really went to the surface.
d_ex_observationpost_05_51,Oh...
d_ex_observationpost_05_52,"It's funny, isn't it?"
d_ex_observationpost_05_53,"He doesn't even dare to face me,"
d_ex_observationpost_05_54,yet he dares to betray me.
d_ex_observationpost_05_55,...!
d_ex_observationpost_05_56,"Anyway. Mister,"
d_ex_observationpost_05_57,I hope you don't report this signal.
d_ex_observationpost_05_58,Why?
d_ex_observationpost_05_59,All right.
d_ex_observationpost_05_60,You're asking the obvious.
d_ex_observationpost_05_61,"If they find out, things will be troublesome."
d_ex_observationpost_05_62,That's what I like about you. You're generous.
d_ex_observationpost_05_63,But... Is this signal
d_ex_observationpost_05_64,still moving?
d_ex_observationpost_05_65,Yes.
d_ex_observationpost_05_66,It's moving slowly though...
d_ex_observationpost_05_67,Huh?
d_ex_observationpost_05_68,I look at the screen again and notice the signal has stopped moving.
d_ex_observationpost_05_69,I-it was moving just now...
d_ex_observationpost_05_70,Is it making a short stop? Or...
d_ex_observationpost_05_71,Hmm.
d_ex_observationpost_05_72,It's fine.
d_ex_observationpost_05_73,"He doesn't have the guts to return, anyway. His fate has long been determined."
d_ex_observationpost_05_74,Thank you for your help.
d_ex_observationpost_05_75,Um...
d_ex_observationpost_05_76,"... Rosanna, you're so cool!"
d_ex_observationpost_05_77,What do you mean?
d_ex_observationpost_05_78,"In shows, people who are betrayed always look hurt..."
d_ex_observationpost_05_79,But you don't look bothered at all.
d_ex_observationpost_05_80,"Wait, no. I should say it makes you look more daring!"
d_ex_observationpost_05_81,"Yeah. I'll look cooler if I tell you I'm unbothered, but that's not true."
d_ex_observationpost_05_82,It's just unnecessary to feel hurt every time there's a traitor.
d_ex_observationpost_05_83,I'm very busy.
d_ex_observationpost_05_84,Wow...
d_ex_observationpost_05_85,I'm really busy. I'll be off now.
d_ex_observationpost_05_86,"Mister, Signal, please take care."
d_ex_observationpost_05_87,You too.
d_ex_observationpost_05_88,Be careful on your way.
d_ex_observationpost_05_89,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_05_90,...
d_ex_observationpost_05_91,... Commander.
d_ex_observationpost_05_92,I want to be like Rosanna!
d_ex_observationpost_05_93,"It is said that after this day, Signal became obsessed with playing a cool and arrogant character for a while."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_title,The Coolest Boss in Town
d_ex_maidcafe_05_1,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_2,Hmmmmmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_3,"Cocoa is pacing in circles, with a look of grave seriousness."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_4,Is something wrong?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_5,Do you need to use the restroom?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_6,... Master.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_7,Do you really think it's appropriate to ask a lady that question?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_8,Sorry.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_9,"It's okay. I'll let it go, just this once."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_10,Is something wrong?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_11,"Yes, there is."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_12,The Boss isn't coming.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_13,What are you talking about?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_14,"A couple days ago, I saw a gangster movie on TV."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_15,"There was a big mafia don in the movie, and she was super cool."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_16,"Yesterday, I was at the park, and I saw someone who reminded me of the actress in the movie."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_17,"There wasn't much of a physical resemblance, but it was more in the way she carried herself."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_18,"There was a crowd of people around her, and she talked just like the don in the movie."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_19,For example?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_20,"One thing she said that stuck out was, ""We're all hyenas, hungry for a piece of the pie."""
d_ex_maidcafe_05_21,So I wrote a note and handed it to her.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_22,Are you sure it wasn't dangerous doing that?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_23,"Nah, they were just filming for a movie."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_24,It wasn't real. Even I can tell the difference.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_25,"Well, if that's the case, that's a relief."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_26,What did you write on the note?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_27,"I said if she's hungry, then she should come to the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_28,...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_29,I asked the person beside her to pass it on.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_30,But it doesn't look like she's coming.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_31,Maybe she never saw my note.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_32,Maybe she's busy?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_33,"I don't think she meant ""hungry"" literally..."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_34,...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_35,"Cocoa seems crestfallen. I need to console her, fast."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_36,*Ring*
d_ex_maidcafe_05_37,Where's the person who gave me this note?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_38,Rosanna?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_39,Mister? I didn't know you'd be here.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_40,Gasp!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_41,It's the boss!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_42,??
d_ex_maidcafe_05_43,You were talking about Rosanna?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_44,"Yeah, she's the one I saw in the park."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_45,...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_46,I don't think what Cocoa saw was from a movie set...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_47,Best I keep that to myself for the moment.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_48,What the...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_49,"I thought they were pulling my leg, but some snot-nosed little kid really did give me this note?"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_50,Boss.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_51,So you saw my note?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_52,*Stare*
d_ex_maidcafe_05_53,Cocoa fixes her eyes on Rosanna.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_54,... Right. I came here because of your note.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_55,Wowzer!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_56,I-it's...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_57,An hon... hon...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_58,It's an honor.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_59,"Yeah, that's it. That's it."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_60,"Well, now that I've figured out who sent this infernal thing, I'm outta here."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_61,Wait!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_62,Boss.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_63,Are you not hungry anymore?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_64,"If you're still hungry, I can make you something to eat before you go."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_65,Huh?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_66,What are you...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_67,*Stare*
d_ex_maidcafe_05_68,Cocoa looks at Rosanna with her puppy-dog eyes.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_69,Fine. Just make it quick.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_70,"Yes, ma'am! Right away!"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_71,Cocoa hustles off to the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_72,You're being awfully friendly.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_73,You're being awfully congenial.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_74,What of it? Can't I be agreeable once in a while?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_75,Am I starting to win you over?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_76,"It's just unexpected, that's all."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_77,Haha. Yeah?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_78,Did you consider me a heartless person before this?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_79,There's no need to be overtly cruel to a child. Even I know that.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_80,Soon after.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_81,"Here you go, Boss! Cocoa's Special Omurice!"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_82,Cocoa brings out a delicious plate of omurice.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_83,There are squiggly drawings of a gun and a rose on top.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_84,I drew some of the stuff I've seen on your body.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_85,What do you think?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_86,... A fine job.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_87,Hehe!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_88,I invited you here for some omurice
d_ex_maidcafe_05_89,because you seemed really hungry before.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_90,... I did?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_91,I also wanna know how to be cool like you.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_92,What should I do?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_93,Let me think...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_94,Just remember this one thing:
d_ex_maidcafe_05_95,An eye for an eye.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_96,Whoa! Okay! But... erm... what does that mean?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_97,Just a second.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_98,Mister.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_99,Give this squirt a hug.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_100,??
d_ex_maidcafe_05_101,Hurry!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_102,"*Grab*
*Crashhh*"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_103,"The moment I wrap my arms around Cocoa, Rosanna stands in front of us."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_104,"Suddenly, the cafe window shatters."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_105,Damn...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_106,they're getting away.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_107,I thought I felt some eyes on us.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_108,I need to go and take care of those punks.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_109,That... was awesome!!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_110,!!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_111,!!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_112,Cocoa pokes her head out from between my arms and stares at Rosanna.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_113,This is just like...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_114,the movie I saw on TV!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_115,The mafia don protecting his subordinates from the bad guys...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_116,Are we filming a movie right now?
d_ex_maidcafe_05_117,Yeah... sure.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_118,Yeah... we're shooting a movie.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_119,Wow! So cool!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_120,Cocoa runs in front of Rosanna.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_121,I've always dreamt of being like you.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_122,Someone who's super cool and protects others from the bad guys.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_123,I've got a cool weapon like you too. Say hi to Cocorella.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_124,...
d_ex_maidcafe_05_125,"Rosanna regards Cocoa with an intense curiosity,"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_126,then pats her on the head.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_127,"Ohmygosh, ohmygosh!"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_128,I can't believe the boss touched me! This is the best day of my life!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_129,"If you want to be as cool as me, you've got your work cut out for you."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_130,"I can do it! When I become a big boss like you, I'll come find you."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_131,And I'll bring Cocorella with me.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_132,"Sounds good. Well, I better go capture those bad guys."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_133,"Sure thing! Go get 'em, Boss!"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_134,"I'll leave this place to you, Mister."
d_ex_maidcafe_05_135,You got it.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_136,"Later, Boss!"
d_ex_maidcafe_05_137,Rosanna smiles brightly at Cocoa as she leaves the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_138,Isn't she the coolest?!
d_ex_maidcafe_05_139,That she is... what an unexpected turn of events.
d_ex_maidcafe_05_140,"Although the Maid Cafe is in shambles, Cocoa is beaming with joy."
d_ex_elevator_05_title,Wings of Imagination
d_ex_elevator_05_1,An urgent meeting has been scheduled quite abruptly.
d_ex_elevator_05_2,I stand in front of the elevator that will take me to the Ark.
d_ex_elevator_05_3,Wait.
d_ex_elevator_05_4,Rosanna blocks my path.
d_ex_elevator_05_5,Rosanna?
d_ex_elevator_05_6,Mister.
d_ex_elevator_05_7,I suggest you wait a while before using the elevator.
d_ex_elevator_05_8,What? Why?
d_ex_elevator_05_9,I found a suspicious slip of paper here.
d_ex_elevator_05_10,Do you want to see?
d_ex_elevator_05_11,Rosanna hands me a piece of paper.
d_ex_elevator_05_12,"I can make out the words ""elevator, sign, destruct"" on it."
d_ex_elevator_05_13,The people who orchestrate these kinds of nefarious attacks
d_ex_elevator_05_14,typically exchange coded messages like this
d_ex_elevator_05_15,before they put their plan in motion.
d_ex_elevator_05_16,"And sure enough, there are all these signs plastered on the elevator,"
d_ex_elevator_05_17,just like it says on the paper.
d_ex_elevator_05_18,Isn't it weird?
d_ex_elevator_05_19,"All these signs, out of the blue, without any prior notice."
d_ex_elevator_05_20,...!!
d_ex_elevator_05_21,Do you think it's serious?
d_ex_elevator_05_22,This is all just a hunch for the moment.
d_ex_elevator_05_23,"So, if you don't mind, I suggest you hold off on using the elevator."
d_ex_elevator_05_24,... I can't.
d_ex_elevator_05_25,Why? Is there something wrong?
d_ex_elevator_05_26,I have a date.
d_ex_elevator_05_27,I have an important meeting.
d_ex_elevator_05_28,Only more reason for me not to let you go.
d_ex_elevator_05_29,"Rosanna says this with a playful smile, but there is an underlying tone of jealousy in her voice which is undeniable."
d_ex_elevator_05_30,"... Actually, I meant to say that I have an important meeting."
d_ex_elevator_05_31,Yeah?
d_ex_elevator_05_32,Hmm...
d_ex_elevator_05_33,Then I'll go with you.
d_ex_elevator_05_34,Just in case.
d_ex_elevator_05_35,I doubt anything will happen that quickly.
d_ex_elevator_05_36,Better safe than sorry.
d_ex_elevator_05_37,"As Rosanna finishes her sentence, she steps into the elevator with me."
d_ex_elevator_05_38,*Buzz*
d_ex_elevator_05_39,"Thankfully, the elevator seems to be operating without any issues."
d_ex_elevator_05_40,See? You were worrying about nothing.
d_ex_elevator_05_41,*Rumble*
d_ex_elevator_05_42,!!
d_ex_elevator_05_43,!!
d_ex_elevator_05_44,The elevator stopped!
d_ex_elevator_05_45,Seems my hunch was correct.
d_ex_elevator_05_46,"I don't know if you're listening, but if you are, it would be in your best interest to show yourselves, right this instant."
d_ex_elevator_05_47,...
d_ex_elevator_05_48,...
d_ex_elevator_05_49,There's dead silence inside the elevator.
d_ex_elevator_05_50,Maybe it's just malfunctioning.
d_ex_elevator_05_51,Maybe it stopped on its own.
d_ex_elevator_05_52,...
d_ex_elevator_05_53,Rosanna stares at the elevator's ceiling.
d_ex_elevator_05_54,"If you're listening to me, I have a message for your boss."
d_ex_elevator_05_55,"If you keep screwing around with me, you'll only be hastening your own death."
d_ex_elevator_05_56,"*Dooong*
*Tangtangtang*"
d_ex_elevator_05_57,"There are a series of small vibrations, and sounds echo outside the elevator."
d_ex_elevator_05_58,Haha.
d_ex_elevator_05_59,"So, it's showtime, then?"
d_ex_elevator_05_60,"I don't know who you are, but you're not making it out of here alive."
d_ex_elevator_05_61,*Rumble*
d_ex_elevator_05_62,*Buzz*
d_ex_elevator_05_63,The elevator starts to descend once again.
d_ex_elevator_05_64,*Click*
d_ex_elevator_05_65,Rosanna takes out her gun once again.
d_ex_elevator_05_66,...
d_ex_elevator_05_67,Ha! What's with that face? Are you scared?
d_ex_elevator_05_68,"Don't worry, I'll protect you."
d_ex_elevator_05_69,I trust you.
d_ex_elevator_05_70,Thanks.
d_ex_elevator_05_71,Rosanna gives me a reassuring smile.
d_ex_elevator_05_72,"Listen, Mister."
d_ex_elevator_05_73,"When these doors open, get behind me."
d_ex_elevator_05_74,When I catch whoever's behind this...
d_ex_elevator_05_75,*Zing*
d_ex_elevator_05_76,The elevator doors finally open.
d_ex_elevator_05_77,Huh? Rosanna?
d_ex_elevator_05_78,Centi?
d_ex_elevator_05_79,Centi stares at us with a wrench in one hand.
d_ex_elevator_05_80,What are you doing here?
d_ex_elevator_05_81,I'm inspecting the elevator.
d_ex_elevator_05_82,How'd you two get in here?
d_ex_elevator_05_83,Didn't you see the signs posted in front of the elevator?
d_ex_elevator_05_84,We blocked the entrance because of the inspection.
d_ex_elevator_05_85,...
d_ex_elevator_05_86,Rosanna passes the note with the keywords to Centi.
d_ex_elevator_05_87,"By any chance, is this note..."
d_ex_elevator_05_88,Huh? I wrote this.
d_ex_elevator_05_89,... Excuse me?
d_ex_elevator_05_90,It must have fallen out of my pocket!
d_ex_elevator_05_91,Why did you write down 'destruct'?
d_ex_elevator_05_92,"Oh, that? Once we're done inspecting the elevator, I've gotta inspect the buildings that are possibly going to be torn down later, so I wrote made a note."
d_ex_elevator_05_93,...
d_ex_elevator_05_94,...
d_ex_elevator_05_95,Don't tell me you ignored the signs and got on the elevator anyway?
d_ex_elevator_05_96,It's dangerous getting on the elevator during an inspection!
d_ex_elevator_05_97,... Sorry.
d_ex_elevator_05_98,"Good thing we were just running some simple tests, and nothing more than that. I'm glad you two are okay."
d_ex_elevator_05_99,"Anyway, I better get started with the inspection proper."
d_ex_elevator_05_100,...
d_ex_elevator_05_101,At least it wasn't as bad as we thought it was.
d_ex_elevator_05_102,You really kept your cool back there.
d_ex_elevator_05_103,Didn't you say you had an urgent meeting?
d_ex_elevator_05_104,"Oh, shoot! I've gotta go."
d_ex_elevator_05_105,I better get going as well.
d_ex_elevator_05_106,Rosanna quickly disappears off into the distance.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_title,It's the Mood that Matters
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_1,Three!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_2,Two!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_3,One!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_4,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_5,"Helm, what are you doing? Say something!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_6,... Ahem.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_7,Today is the official opening of the outdoor pool at the Outpost.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_8,"However, this place is by no means a playground. It could very well become a shipyard for the Admire."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_9,I don't want people to think of it as a place where you can fool around.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_10,"Jeez, why so serious? You oughta lighten up."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_11,I disagree.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_12,This is something that needs to be made clear right from the start.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_13,"So long as we make it clear what this place is meant to be used for right off the bat,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_14,we won't get any complaints from people down the line.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_15,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_16,Don't worry.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_17,"Whenever I come here, I'll treat this place with the utmost respect."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_18,That's right.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_19,Why aren't either of you dressed appropriately?
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_20,What are you talking about? These are our training uniforms.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_21,"Sorry, but I'm not buying that for a second."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_22,"If you don't believe us, it's best you see it for yourself."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_23,"Ready, Master?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_24,Ready.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_25,Let's show these two what long-term training can do.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_26,All right!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_27,Whoo... Ha...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_28,!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_29,What are you...?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_30,Neon moves her hands slowly and places them on her knees.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_31,Waterpower Breath: First Segment.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_32,"She begins to bend, and then straighten, her knees over and over."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_33,Bend your knees.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_34,I imitate Neon's moves.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_35,"One, two, three, four!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_36,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_37,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_38,"I think we're ready to go, don't you, Master?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_39,"Yes, let's try not to break the flow."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_40,All right!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_41,Neon claps her hands together.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_42,Waterpower Breath: Second Segment!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_43,"Neon starts rotating her wrists, making her resemble a small windmill."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_44,"Her feet are firmly planted on the ground, her big toes also wiggling in small concentric circles."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_45,Rotate your wrists and ankles.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_46,I imitate Neon's moves.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_47,"One, two, three, four!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_48,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_49,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_50,Whoo! Feelin' good!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_51,Time to take it home.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_52,"You've gotta get the timing right, or else..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_53,"Yeah yeah, our bodies will stiffen right back up again."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_54,Exactly.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_55,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_56,So... Go!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_57,Neon quietly relaxes her entire body.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_58,Waterpower Breath: Third Segment.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_59,"At this moment, Neon's mind and body are united as one."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_60,Shake your hands and feet!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_61,I once again follow Neon's lead.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_62,*Jump jump*
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_63,*Jump jump*
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_64,Whoo!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_65,I'm ready to go.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_66,"Are you ready for my mountain-shaking, earth-shattering waterpower?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_67,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_68,??
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_69,"What's wrong, Master?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_70,You kinda freaked me out with that description.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_71,Are you sure we're gonna make it through this?
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_72,What are you talking about?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_73,We've been through much worse than this.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_74,This is nothing!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_75,Are you sure?
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_76,Can I really take your word for it?
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_77,Of course.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_78,"And most importantly,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_79,"if you don't start right after you finish the Waterpower Breath,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_80,its effect might wear off before you know it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_81,"Worst case scenario, your feet might even cramp up."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_82,Don't jinx it!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_83,"Whoops, sorry."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_84,*Pat*
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_85,Neon pats my shoulder.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_86,We've gotta be brave.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_87,You're right.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_88,I'll try to believe in myself as much as you believe in me.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_89,Good.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_90,Now... go!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_91,"Neon neatly slips into a swim ring,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_92,"and sprints forward, jumping into the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_93,*Plop*
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_94,Hahaha.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_95,I follow her into the pool.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_96,*Plop*
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_97,Ahahaha.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_98,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_99,Wait.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_100,"Subordinate, what are you doing?!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_101,"Just leave them be,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_102,Helm.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_103,"In case you can't see the obvious,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_104,they're practically dying to enjoy the pool.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_105,Aren't they adorable?
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_106,"... I have to admit, yes."
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_107,I actually kind of want to join them.
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_108,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_109,Ha ha ha!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_110,"Can you withstand my Waterpower Breath, Master?!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_111,Ahahaha!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_112,I don't know if I can!
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_113,Hah-hah...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_114,Although I have to
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_115,prioritize my duty above all else
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_116,when I see the laughs on their faces...
d_ex_outdoorpool_01_117,I think I can bend the rules just a little today.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_title,Volume's Pool Party
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_1,"Master,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_2,did you bring your swimwear?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_3,Got it right here.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_4,"Let's head inside, then."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_5,Why did you tell me to meet you at the pool today?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_6,*Creak*
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_7,"Neon opens the door to the pool to reveal Volume, who is greeting us from inside."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_8,Yo!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_9,About time you showed up.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_10,Volume? What are you doing here?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_11,Ah...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_12,We're throwing a pool party in about a week at the larger pool.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_13,So I was practicing here.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_14,What's a pool party?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_15,Sounds like fun.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_16,...?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_17,Are you serious?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_18,"Just look at the name, you dingus. It's a party by the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_19,You seem like someone who's been around the block. I can't believe you haven't heard of this before.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_20,"Oh, it will be."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_21,"It's a bit boring practicing in here by myself, though."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_22,"So I decided to call some friends over, and voilà,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_23,Neon came running.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_24,"A pool party sounds fun,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_25,but what exactly are we going to do there?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_26,Do we swim in order to build up our waterpower?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_27,What? No!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_28,All sorts of celebrities will get together and take pictures.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_29,Everyone will be wearing sexy bikinis to show off their summer bodies.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_30,There'll be an open bar as well.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_31,"And that, my friends, is a recipe for a good time."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_32,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_33,But I'm not a celebrity.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_34,And I don't drink.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_35,And I'm not sexy either...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_36,Ummm...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_37,"I mean, yeah, you are wearing a really cute swimsuit."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_38,"Anyway, we'll also be dancing there. Want me to show you some of the music we'll be playing?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_39,Sure!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_40,Volume starts playing deafeningly loud electronic dance music.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_41,Are yoouu reaaaadyyyy?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_42,Yeahhh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_43,*Heavy bass playing*
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_44,Everybody shake your moneymaker!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_45,Shake my head.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_46,Shake my booty.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_47,"Yahoo!! That's the spirit, Master! Shake it!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_48,Oh boy... I'm feeling kinda dizzy... yahoo!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_49,"Oh yeah, twerk it, Master!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_50,I'll join you! Whoo!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_51,Hah-hah! People are so happy!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_52,"This is nice, but we need to take this to the next level."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_53,I need something to make a big splash...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_54,*Creak*
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_55,Hello!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_56,You said you needed someone to practice with?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_57,Speak of the devil!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_58,Here comes the life of the party!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_59,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_60,Mary!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_61,Come on and join us!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_62,Yahoo!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_63,Oh my goodness...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_64,Is this why you asked me to wear a bikini?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_65,So should I just dance to the music?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_66,"No, no."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_67,That's not your job.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_68,"Come on, sit here and dip your feet in the water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_69,Like this?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_70,Good.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_71,"Now, take a glass of champagne."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_72,"Hehe, this is fun!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_73,Okay.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_74,Perfect!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_75,Manager!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_76,Yahooooo!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_77,Are you someone who dances to the beat...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_78,Is it okay for me to drink this?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_79,or...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_80,are you someone who shows off their figure?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_81,I...
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_82,prefer dancing to the beat.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_83,prefer sitting down and showing off my figure.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_84,"Okay, good!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_85,"Let's crank up the volume, then!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_86,Now shake it with Neon!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_87,*Heavy bass playing*
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_88,This is so exciting!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_89,Let's go to the pool party next week!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_90,Sure thing!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_91,Yeah!!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_92,Yeah!!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_93,"Okay, good!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_94,Then take off that stuffy-looking shirt and throw it away.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_95,"Now, go sit down with Mary. Cheers!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_96,*Clink*
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_97,"Hehe, looks like I've come to the right place."
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_98,I even get to share a drink with the Commander!
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_99,"Apparently, this is a test run for the Ark's pool party next week?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_100,Would you like to come with me?
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_101,Sure.
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_102,"I have a great time at the pool,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_02_103,all while imagining what the pool party next week will be like.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_title,Aria on EZS
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_1,I was invited to a boat party on the Admire a week from now.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_2,The show I'll be presenting is called The Woman and the Sea.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_3,It's about a woman who sails out to sea
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_4,and comes out triumphant over the legendary sea Raptures after a fierce battle.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_5,"At the climax, there'll be artificial rain."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_6,"In order to really sell the emotion of that scene,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_7,I think some rehearsals in an approximate environment are called for.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_8,So you're coming to the party as well?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_9,Sounds like it'll be quite the show.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_10,It seems that everyone from Prima Donna is competing to launch summer activities lately.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_11,Are you guys all coordinating this together?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_12,No.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_13,I don't adjust my schedule to accommodate other singers.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_14,So it's just a coincidence?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_15,Amazing!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_16,I thought so as well. That's why I accepted the role.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_17,"Against all odds, a human fighting something more powerful than themselves..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_18,It's simply sublime.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_19,Agreed.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_20,"So, where do we factor into this?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_21,Hmm...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_22,"While we rehearse the climax,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_23,I want Maestro and the girls to act as the sea Raptures.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_24,"Oh, dear."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_25,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_26,... Are you kidding?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_27,No. I'm quite serious.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_28,"Otherwise, I won't have the confidence to pull it off properly."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_29,"The woman in the story, out of desperation, risks her entire life,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_30,throwing it all on the line in order to continue an impossible fight.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_31,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_32,"Although she defeats the Raptures in the end,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_33,"on the way back to the Ark, she loses all of the treasures she won from the hard-fought battle."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_34,That is why this scene is so important.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_35,"Even if it all ends in futility,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_36,"the fight itself, the valiant act of struggle, is no less sublime for it."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_37,That's what I want to convey to the audience with my performance.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_38,Quite profound.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_39,Precisely. That's why I can't afford to make any mistakes.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_40,"But, as you can well imagine, I don't have the same intense passion that the woman in the story has."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_41,Then I thought about you.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_42,"Maestro, you and your friends, unlike me, are brimming with passion."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_43,"Using those water guns in your hands,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_44,"I want you to stimulate me, to anger me, to set my heart and mind ablaze."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_45,I believe that's the only way that I can complete this opera.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_46,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_47,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_48,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_49,Master.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_50,I'm so moved.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_51,The spirit of acting that Aria wishes to access...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_52,It sounds very similar to me and the spirits of waterpower and firepower.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_53,... I don't think they're quite the same thing.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_54,I think I understand it now.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_55,"It's like a doctor who keeps forging ahead with surgery,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_56,even though they know the end result may not be ideal.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_57,I understand perfectly!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_58,There seems to have been some kind of misunderstanding...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_59,... Aria.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_60,"Once we start, I'll put my heart and soul into this."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_61,Are you sure this is what you want?
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_62,Of course.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_63,That's exactly what I came here for.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_64,Heh-heh. Great.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_65,"In that case, you can go ahead and start rehearsing the climax."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_66,"As for us, we'll do our part"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_67,and become the horrifying sea Raptures you want us to be.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_68,Graaaahhh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_69,... Very well.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_70,Aria takes a deep breath.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_71,"Cutting through the stygian storm, the creaking ship slices through the dark waters."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_72,"Standing upon the deck, there is a mechanical woman."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_73,She aims her weapon at the Raptures.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_74,"... Now, Mary!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_75,Okay! Go!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_76,"Mary and Neon quickly prime their squirt guns,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_77,"surround Aria, and begin firing away."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_78,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_79,"I will never be defeated,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_80,"even if my body is shattered by the fiend's—pff, pff..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_81,even if my body is shattered by the fiend's ordnances.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_82,I will never... cough... be defeated.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_83,Whoo... The battle is getting intense.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_84,But I can really feel the emotion coming through.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_85,"A Nikke, standing mightily amidst the raging storm,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_86,defying insurmountable odds in order to stake her claim to live.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_87,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_88,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_89,... Despair!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_90,The anguish even in the face of... *Cough*
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_91,"Aria, are you okay?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_92,I think you've swallowed a bit too much water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_93,"I'm fine, Maestro."
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_94,"The moment they started shooting water in my face,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_95,I could feel something bubbling deep inside my chest.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_96,Perhaps this is precisely what that woman felt...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_97,The intense will to survive.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_98,I feel like I'm getting closer to understanding her.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_99,You just look kind of irritated to me...
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_100,Hyah!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_101,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_102,Hehe!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_103,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_104,Aaarrrgghh!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_105,For victory!
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_106,"During rehearsal that day,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_107,Aria sings the highest note that's ever been sung.
d_ex_outdoorpool_03_108,Her performance brings everyone to tears
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_title,The Sound of Water
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_1,Um...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_2,"First of all, thank you for giving me your precious time."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_3,"No, thank you!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_4,I can't believe I'm this close to Noise.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_5,This is amazing!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_6,"Pepper, please. Calm down."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_7,"Noise, why did you call us over? Is something wrong?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_8,Well...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_9,"First off, you've gotta keep it a secret, okay?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_10,"I'm used to upholding doctor-patient confidentiality, so my lips are sealed."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_11,Don't worry.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_12,Thank you.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_13,I'm going to perform on the summer stage.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_14,"They said they were going to employ some water as a special effect,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_15,but... I'm a little afraid of water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_16,You are?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_17,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_18,How on earth do you take a shower?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_19,!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_20,You can't just ask a girl that so upfront!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_21,"To be fair,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_22,it is a good question.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_23,Your answer could help us determine whether you have a genuine phobia of water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_24,It will?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_25,"All right, fine. Taking showers is no problem."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_26,"Actually, this is the first time I've ever felt scared about water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_27,Hmm...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_28,How much water is there going to be on stage?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_29,"I'm gonna stand under a waterfall, and they're gonna pour water directly on me."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_30,I've seen the stage... the water will be coming from fairly high up.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_31,Yikes!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_32,I think we've found the problem.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_33,Isn't that a bit dangerous?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_34,"I understand a few water jets here and there, but an entire waterfall?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_35,"It's already been incorporated into the choreography, so it's too late to change it at this point."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_36,"Besides, I'm a professional."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_37,"I want my performance to be flawless, even on this kind of stage."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_38,So you can help me to overcome my fear?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_39,Of course.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_40,I think it's safe to say that we're gonna be exposing you to plenty of water. Do you have a swimsuit handy?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_41,"I do, but I'm supposed to wear a costume for the performance."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_42,So it'd be better for me to practice in ordinary clothes.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_43,"Okay, no problem."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_44,"Commander, can you sprinkle some water on Noise?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_45,We'll stand in front and observe her reactions.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_46,Got it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_47,"Okay, we'll start off nice and easy"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_48,with the squirt gun.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_49,Will a squirt gun really be any help?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_50,Your fears are always magnified whenever there's uncertainty.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_51,"So, I won't tell you when we're going to hit you with the water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_52,I see.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_53,All right. I'll try my best.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_54,That's the spirit!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_55,"Whenever you're ready, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_56,I shoot a small stream of water at Noise's back.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_57,Hyah!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_58,"Eep, it's cold!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_59,How do you feel?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_60,"Tingly, and a little cold."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_61,It did catch me a bit off guard though...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_62,That's perfectly normal.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_63,Shall we move on to the next stage?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_64,We will be using the sprinklers in the ceiling to create a shower this time.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_65,"Crank it to the max, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_66,"I turn the water pressure to the highest level,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_67,then turn on the sprinkler when Noise least expects it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_68,Agh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_69,How about this time?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_70,Definitely more of a shock than before.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_71,"But at the same time, I was anticipating when it might hit me, so I kind of mentally prepared in advance."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_72,Is the water flow okay?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_73,"Yeah, it's similar to that in my shower."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_74,Got it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_75,Let's move on to the final stage then.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_76,"Are you ready, Commander?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_77,Ready.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_78,What's the final stage?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_79,That's a secret.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_80,Just imagine you're on stage.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_81,"You're standing under the waterfall, waiting for it to come down on you."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_82,It's kinda scary...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_83,Don't be scared. It's not a real waterfall.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_84,"Just imagine it in your mind, and think of this as a dry run, pardon the pun, for the real thing."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_85,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_86,I'll try.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_87,Noise clears her throat.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_88,She starts singing.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_89,Wake up that summer ♬
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_90,Let the wind spread ♬
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_91,In the cold waterfall ♬
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_92,Time for the waterfall!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_93,I splash a huge basin of water on Noise.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_94,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_95,It grows more brilliant ♬
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_96,Noise doesn't stop singing.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_97,The water droplets dripping off her add a certain je n'ais ce quoi to the song.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_98,Whew...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_99,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_100,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_101,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_102,How was that?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_103,I can see why they arranged for the waterfall.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_104,That was beautiful!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_105,Was it?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_106,Thank goodness...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_107,How did you feel when you got splashed?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_108,"It actually wasn't that bad, so long as I focused on my singing."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_109,It also helped that it was you splashing the water on me.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_110,"Until now, I thought there was no way I could keep my cool on stage."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_111,Hmm.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_112,"How about when it's showtime, you imagine it's the Commander activating the waterfall?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_113,Hmm...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_114,That would be very reassuring.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_115,Then it's perfect!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_116,Allow me to write you a 'prescription'.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_117,"Commander, can you act as one of Noise's stage staff?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_118,... Me?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_119,!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_120,"Are you okay with that, Producer?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_121,Pretty please?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_122,All you've got to do is press the button to release the waterfall.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_123,Fine.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_124,Sounds kinda complicated...
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_125,You think so?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_126,"I won't twist your arm, but..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_127,Are you sure you can't help?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_128,I want to put on the best show I can.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_129,I'm just kidding. Of course I'll do it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_130,Really?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_131,"Thank you, Producer."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_132,I owe you big time.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_133,"Hehe, consider yourself cured."
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_134,Can we go to the show?
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_135,Of course.
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_136,"I'll send you the tickets. Be there, or be square!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_04_137,"We all leave the swimming pool together, eagerly looking forward to Noise's upcoming performance."
d_ex_hospital_06_title,Cats and Senior Year
d_ex_hospital_06_1,"Teacher,"
d_ex_hospital_06_2,"I get that my teeth aren't in the greatest shape after all those sweets I ate,"
d_ex_hospital_06_3,but taking me to the hospital really isn't necessary.
d_ex_hospital_06_4,"You're not even my home teacher,"
d_ex_hospital_06_5,and I don't even think he would go to these lengths.
d_ex_hospital_06_6,You said your teeth were hurting.
d_ex_hospital_06_7,Would you rather go on your own?
d_ex_hospital_06_8,It's not that.
d_ex_hospital_06_9,They just hurt for a tiny little moment last night.
d_ex_hospital_06_10,"I had a good night's sleep, and they're much better now. Honestly."
d_ex_hospital_06_11,...
d_ex_hospital_06_12,I'm in my Junior year.
d_ex_hospital_06_13,I can handle these kinds of things myself.
d_ex_hospital_06_14,You can go home now. You don't have to...
d_ex_hospital_06_15,Meow!
d_ex_hospital_06_16,*Taptaptap*
d_ex_hospital_06_17,??
d_ex_hospital_06_18,"Sorry, we didn't scare you, did we?"
d_ex_hospital_06_19,"Biscuit asked me to give Nero a physical,"
d_ex_hospital_06_20,but I didn't count on her being this terrified of the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_06_21,Ding-dong.
d_ex_hospital_06_22,"Nero, please come to room number 1."
d_ex_hospital_06_23,"Nero, we've got to go inside."
d_ex_hospital_06_24,...
d_ex_hospital_06_25,I don't want to.
d_ex_hospital_06_26,*Taptaptap*
d_ex_hospital_06_27,"Nero frantically scampers across the waiting room,"
d_ex_hospital_06_28,and hurls herself into an empty cupboard.
d_ex_hospital_06_29,Holy moly...
d_ex_hospital_06_30,What's gotten into people these days?
d_ex_hospital_06_31,"It's her turn, but she's refusing to go in."
d_ex_hospital_06_32,Put your hand on your chest and say that again.
d_ex_hospital_06_33,Rei takes her right hand and places it on her chest.
d_ex_hospital_06_34,I really don't know what's gotten into people these days.
d_ex_hospital_06_35,"Rei, have you no shame?"
d_ex_hospital_06_36,Have a heart!
d_ex_hospital_06_37,"Quiet down, you two."
d_ex_hospital_06_38,"If I were the one in charge, I wouldn't let her get away with this kind of thing."
d_ex_hospital_06_39,You've got to crack the whip if people don't listen to you. Especially if they're younger.
d_ex_hospital_06_40,"Otherwise, you'll have spoiled kids running around in public places throwing tantrums, and no one wants that."
d_ex_hospital_06_41,"All right, you talk to her then."
d_ex_hospital_06_42,Huh? Why would I?
d_ex_hospital_06_43,I don't know her from Adam.
d_ex_hospital_06_44,"If you manage to convince her, there's a strawberry candy in it for you."
d_ex_hospital_06_45,Strawberry candy?!
d_ex_hospital_06_46,Where? From who?
d_ex_hospital_06_47,Diesel. She's always carrying around bunches of the stuff.
d_ex_hospital_06_48,...
d_ex_hospital_06_49,Hmm...
d_ex_hospital_06_50,"Just so you know, I'm not doing this solely for the candy."
d_ex_hospital_06_51,I just can't stand seeing people running amok.
d_ex_hospital_06_52,"So don't get it twisted. Anyway, sit back and learn."
d_ex_hospital_06_53,Rei strides towards the cupboard with her arms crossed.
d_ex_hospital_06_54,Hey.
d_ex_hospital_06_55,...
d_ex_hospital_06_56,You can't be acting like this in public.
d_ex_hospital_06_57,All I want to do is leave this place.
d_ex_hospital_06_58,"You can't do that. Diesel brought you all the way here, so the doctor would see you."
d_ex_hospital_06_59,You acting like this is being disrespectful towards her.
d_ex_hospital_06_60,...
d_ex_hospital_06_61,I never asked for a physical.
d_ex_hospital_06_62,Never once was I consulted
d_ex_hospital_06_63,during this process.
d_ex_hospital_06_64,How is that being respectful towards me?
d_ex_hospital_06_65,You've got it all wrong.
d_ex_hospital_06_66,Diesel and Biscuit are doing this because they care about you.
d_ex_hospital_06_67,I know that.
d_ex_hospital_06_68,"But still, there's a line they shouldn't cross."
d_ex_hospital_06_69,"From what I can see, you seem really into sweets, yes?"
d_ex_hospital_06_70,"Imagine if Scoops forbade you from eating any candy for an entire year,"
d_ex_hospital_06_71,"but said it was ""for your own good""."
d_ex_hospital_06_72,Uh...
d_ex_hospital_06_73,...
d_ex_hospital_06_74,Teacher.
d_ex_hospital_06_75,"When she puts it that way, it kinda makes sense."
d_ex_hospital_06_76,"So, are you giving up on the strawberry candy?"
d_ex_hospital_06_77,!
d_ex_hospital_06_78,It's a limited-edition AZX wrapper too.
d_ex_hospital_06_79,!!
d_ex_hospital_06_80,That's it!
d_ex_hospital_06_81,You better listen up.
d_ex_hospital_06_82,What is it now?
d_ex_hospital_06_83,You just asked me how I'd feel if I couldn't have any sweets for an entire year.
d_ex_hospital_06_84,Uh-huh.
d_ex_hospital_06_85,"Well, I've thought about it, and that's totally different from this current situation."
d_ex_hospital_06_86,A physical only lasts for a little while.
d_ex_hospital_06_87,"You grin and bear it for an hour or two, and then it's all over. How can you compare that with a year of no candy?"
d_ex_hospital_06_88,"If I were you, I'd just get it over with so I could go home."
d_ex_hospital_06_89,...
d_ex_hospital_06_90,I know what I don't like.
d_ex_hospital_06_91,"Everyone around me knows how much cats hate this sort of thing, so why would they force it on me?"
d_ex_hospital_06_92,"You're being a real crybaby about this whole thing, you know that?"
d_ex_hospital_06_93,!!
d_ex_hospital_06_94,You think you're better than me? How about you go a few hours without eating candy?
d_ex_hospital_06_95,Fine!
d_ex_hospital_06_96,You think I won't be able to do it?
d_ex_hospital_06_97,"To be honest, a year or two ago, I might not have been able to. But I'm in my third year now."
d_ex_hospital_06_98,So this is a piece of cake!
d_ex_hospital_06_99,...
d_ex_hospital_06_100,Are you sure about that?
d_ex_hospital_06_101,Cross my heart.
d_ex_hospital_06_102,...
d_ex_hospital_06_103,Ding-dong.
d_ex_hospital_06_104,"Nero, please come to room number 1."
d_ex_hospital_06_105,Now hurry up and get your butt in there.
d_ex_hospital_06_106,The ding-dong lady is calling you.
d_ex_hospital_06_107,...
d_ex_hospital_06_108,Nero slowly creeps out of the closet.
d_ex_hospital_06_109,"Whoa, you actually convinced her?"
d_ex_hospital_06_110,That's incredible!
d_ex_hospital_06_111,What can I say? I'm good.
d_ex_hospital_06_112,"Now, about that strawberry candy I was promised..."
d_ex_hospital_06_113,Seriously?
d_ex_hospital_06_114,Are you already going to break your promise?
d_ex_hospital_06_115,!!
d_ex_hospital_06_116,"I'd love to give you some,"
d_ex_hospital_06_117,"but I do, I feel Nero will hop right back into that cupboard."
d_ex_hospital_06_118,"Sorry, we'll have to take a rain check on the sweets. I'll give you one next time I see you."
d_ex_hospital_06_119,*Click*
d_ex_hospital_06_120,Diesel and Nero both proceed into the examination room.
d_ex_hospital_06_121,...
d_ex_hospital_06_122,...
d_ex_hospital_06_123,*Sob*
d_ex_hospital_06_124,Teacher...
d_ex_hospital_06_125,This is so unfair!
d_ex_hospital_06_126,How can I go on when there's such injustice in the world?
d_ex_hospital_06_127,I worked so hard to get that candy...
d_ex_hospital_06_128,Welcome to being an adult.
d_ex_toyshop_06_title,Happy Cat
d_ex_toyshop_06_1,New cat toys available now!
d_ex_toyshop_06_2,This was a notice that was posted at the toy store a few days ago.
d_ex_toyshop_06_3,"The cats are getting a bit tired of the toys that are at the shelter,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_4,so I was thinking of buying them some new ones.
d_ex_toyshop_06_5,Can you help me choose which ones to buy?
d_ex_toyshop_06_6,Aren't you the most knowledgeable when it comes to this kind of stuff?
d_ex_toyshop_06_7,"Yes,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_8,but there's only one problem.
d_ex_toyshop_06_9,"Usually, when you buy an item for the first time, you need to test it out."
d_ex_toyshop_06_10,"However, if I do that myself, I end up ruining the toys..."
d_ex_toyshop_06_11,So that's where I need your help.
d_ex_toyshop_06_12,"This is fairly outside of my wheelhouse, but I'll do what I can to help."
d_ex_toyshop_06_13,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_06_14,??
d_ex_toyshop_06_15,Where are the owners?
d_ex_toyshop_06_16,There's a sign that says they'll be back soon.
d_ex_toyshop_06_17,Hmm...
d_ex_toyshop_06_18,"Those two like to horse around, but they are helpful when it comes to suggesting which toys to buy."
d_ex_toyshop_06_19,I guess we'll have to do it ourselves.
d_ex_toyshop_06_20,"To start, why don't you choose something that you like?"
d_ex_toyshop_06_21,Good idea.
d_ex_toyshop_06_22,Nero picks up a box which is riddled with holes.
d_ex_toyshop_06_23,*Toss*
d_ex_toyshop_06_24,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_25,*Toss*
d_ex_toyshop_06_26,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_27,What is this?
d_ex_toyshop_06_28,"It's interesting, but I don't know how to play with it."
d_ex_toyshop_06_29,Uh... you usually put some other toys inside of it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_30,"If you put something like say, a cat ball, or some other toy cats like to play with inside it,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_31,they can put their paws through the holes and try to bat at it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_32,Thanks for the explanation.
d_ex_toyshop_06_33,"But what are you doing at the toy store, Admi?"
d_ex_toyshop_06_34,I actually came to buy some cat toys as well.
d_ex_toyshop_06_35,"I heard there were some new releases, so I wanted to donate some to the shelter."
d_ex_toyshop_06_36,Oh! An ally.
d_ex_toyshop_06_37,You can help us choose what to buy.
d_ex_toyshop_06_38,"The store owners aren't here at the moment, so we're having trouble making a selection."
d_ex_toyshop_06_39,"Sure, if you're okay with it."
d_ex_toyshop_06_40,Although...
d_ex_toyshop_06_41,How about we first figure out how to play with that box?
d_ex_toyshop_06_42,All right!
d_ex_toyshop_06_43,The three of us gather several cat balls and place them inside the box.
d_ex_toyshop_06_44,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_45,How about that.
d_ex_toyshop_06_46,"Now that all these balls are inside it, I feel like batting them around."
d_ex_toyshop_06_47,*Swoosh*
d_ex_toyshop_06_48,"Still, so far it's no great shakes."
d_ex_toyshop_06_49,*Swoosh swoosh*
d_ex_toyshop_06_50,Surely there's some way we can make this more exciting?
d_ex_toyshop_06_51,*Swoosh swoosh swoosh*
d_ex_toyshop_06_52,"Like a wind-up mouse that moves on its own, or something mobile like..."
d_ex_toyshop_06_53,*Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh*
d_ex_toyshop_06_54,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_55,"Nero, snap out of it."
d_ex_toyshop_06_56,Quietly put the box in the shopping cart.
d_ex_toyshop_06_57,Looks like she's really into that toy.
d_ex_toyshop_06_58,I bet the cats at the shelter will love it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_59,I'm gonna buy one.
d_ex_toyshop_06_60,...!!
d_ex_toyshop_06_61,Looks like I should buy some more balls.
d_ex_toyshop_06_62,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_63,"Sorry, I got a little worked up. My mistake."
d_ex_toyshop_06_64,"Don't worry, it was a big help."
d_ex_toyshop_06_65,Right.
d_ex_toyshop_06_66,Any chance you can point us towards any other toys that are of interest to you?
d_ex_toyshop_06_67,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_68,Let's see...
d_ex_toyshop_06_69,How about some cat wands?
d_ex_toyshop_06_70,Aren't there already plenty of those at the shelter?
d_ex_toyshop_06_71,"Loads,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_72,but cats get tired of the same toys quite easily.
d_ex_toyshop_06_73,So I try to swap out the old toys for new ones once in a while.
d_ex_toyshop_06_74,Hmm... there are so many types to choose from.
d_ex_toyshop_06_75,Is there anyone that you like in particular?
d_ex_toyshop_06_76,Not really.
d_ex_toyshop_06_77,"When you're my age, you've played pretty much all the wands available,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_78,"so regardless of what you play with, it's not terribly stimulating."
d_ex_toyshop_06_79,"Still, you never know, so go ahead and choose one, Scoops."
d_ex_toyshop_06_80,A cat wand with a floundering fish on it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_81,A cat wand with a fluffy mouse on it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_82,A cat wand with a colorful peacock feather on it.
d_ex_toyshop_06_83,Hmm...
d_ex_toyshop_06_84,No surprises here.
d_ex_toyshop_06_85,A classic toy with a classic design.
d_ex_toyshop_06_86,I should have figured that the cat wand would be a disappointment.
d_ex_toyshop_06_87,*Whip*
d_ex_toyshop_06_88,I take the cat wand and make a big swirl through the air.
d_ex_toyshop_06_89,*Jump*
d_ex_toyshop_06_90,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_91,...
d_ex_toyshop_06_92,Make another wide swirl horizontally.
d_ex_toyshop_06_93,Make another wide swirl vertically.
d_ex_toyshop_06_94,*Whip*
d_ex_toyshop_06_95,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_96,"Wow, she nearly made it all the way to the front of the store with that jump!"
d_ex_toyshop_06_97,*Whip*
d_ex_toyshop_06_98,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_99,"Wow, she nearly hit the ceiling with that jump!"
d_ex_toyshop_06_100,We should buy this one too.
d_ex_toyshop_06_101,We proceed to test several additional toys.
d_ex_toyshop_06_102,This cat wheel...
d_ex_toyshop_06_103,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_104,*Spin spin spin*
d_ex_toyshop_06_105,Let's buy this too.
d_ex_toyshop_06_106,"Hey, check out this cat tunnel."
d_ex_toyshop_06_107,Meow!
d_ex_toyshop_06_108,*Crumple*
d_ex_toyshop_06_109,... Are you planning on staying there all day?
d_ex_toyshop_06_110,"Thanks to Nero displaying such an enthusiastic response for certain toys,"
d_ex_toyshop_06_111,we're able to finish our shopping in no time.
d_ex_toyshop_06_112,*Yawn*
d_ex_toyshop_06_113,... Weird.
d_ex_toyshop_06_114,Why am I so tired? All we did was shop.
d_ex_toyshop_06_115,Pff...
d_ex_toyshop_06_116,What's so funny?
d_ex_toyshop_06_117,It's always fun to see a cat enjoy itself.
d_ex_toyshop_06_118,It's nice that you're happy.
d_ex_toyshop_06_119,... Meow?
d_ex_toyshop_06_120,That's right.
d_ex_toyshop_06_121,I hope the cats at the shelter get as much fun out of these toys
d_ex_toyshop_06_122,as you did.
d_ex_toyshop_06_123,They will for sure.
d_ex_toyshop_06_124,They've been Nero-approved.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_title,Cats: A Most Baffling Creature
d_ex_clothingstore_06_1,"Hellooo, my lovely Lupins☆"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_2,Today I want to introduce a special guest.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_3,"She's one of the most powerful people, no, creatures, in the entire Ark,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_4,with a smoldering and intense physicality that can't be beaten!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_5,"But, before I introduce the special guest,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_6,"I suppose I should introduce our regular guest, shouldn't I? Hehe."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_7,"Well, here he is, the one you all should be well acquainted with by now..."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_8,"Actually, are humans okay with this amount of sunlight?"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_9,"Anyway, say hello to the one and only Sweetie, who's always the life of the party!"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_10,"Hello, everyone. The wait is over, here I am!"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_11,I wouldn't describe myself like that...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_12,"You've become so much more confident, Sweetie!"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_13,"Of course, you have every right to be self-assured, but this is all being recorded."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_14,So don't forget that this is all being kept for posterity.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_15,"Sweetie, you're honestly far too modest. It's a bad habit that you really need to shake."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_16,"If I was you, I'd be proud and strut my stuff 24/7."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_17,Anyhoo!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_18,You all must be going mad wondering who our special guest is.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_19,"This person, or species, rather, is quite rare in the Ark."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_20,"However, due to her incredible power, you've probably seen her before."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_21,"Then, Nero, can you introduce yourself?"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_22,"Meow, I'm Nero."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_23,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_24,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_25,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_26,Er... is that all?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_27,Meow.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_28,... Hehe.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_29,It appears our guest is a bit shy.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_30,"At any rate, let's proceed with the show."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_31,"In a nutshell,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_32,today's show is centered around cats.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_33,"To be more precise, we'll be having a cat pick out what's the best look for a hot date."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_34,"Typically, cats aren't the most compassionate creatures and don't care too much about others,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_35,what we have here today is essentially a cat capable of communication!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_36,Then... Nero?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_37,"We'll have Sweetie try on a variety of stylish outfits,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_38,and you can vote on which one is the best.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_39,Meow.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_40,I'll take that as a yes.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_41,"Today, we're going to have Sweetie acting as our very own supermodel,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_42,strutting his stuff and showing off the hottest new styles perfect for that hot date you've been planning!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_43,"The outfits are on the hanger to your left,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_44,so choose whichever one catches your eye.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_45,Okay.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_46,*Screech* *Click*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_47,I choose an outfit that I like and bring it into the changing room.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_48,*Rustle rustle*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_49,*Scratch*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_50,...??
d_ex_clothingstore_06_51,*Scratch*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_52,"Rupee, what is this sound?"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_53,Uh... I think it's Nero.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_54,"She's scratching at the changing room door,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_55,but I have no idea why...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_56,Scoops!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_57,Come out!
d_ex_clothingstore_06_58,*Scratch*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_59,Is something wrong?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_60,It's dangerous in there.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_61,It's dangerous wherever I can't see you.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_62,*Scratch*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_63,"Uh... Sweetie, are you done changing yet?"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_64,I'll hurry up.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_65,A moment later.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_66,I change into the outfit as fast as I can.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_67,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_68,Are you coming out?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_69,Yes.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_70,Then it's okay.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_71,Nero casually backs away from the door
d_ex_clothingstore_06_72,and starts grooming herself.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_73,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_74,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_75,Hmmm.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_76,She got awfully calm all of a sudden.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_77,Guess we were worried for nothing.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_78,I'm not so sure. She was acting like the sky was falling.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_79,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_80,"Just to be sure, should we do a test?"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_81,*Click*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_82,I open the changing room door.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_83,*Taptaptap*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_84,Nero bounds over towards the opening and raises her arms aggressively.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_85,*Click*
d_ex_clothingstore_06_86,I close the door.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_87,...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_88,Nero lowers her arms and saunters back to her original spot.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_89,What on earth?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_90,What is it with cats?
d_ex_clothingstore_06_91,Beats me.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_92,They truly are baffling creatures.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_93,Indeed...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_94,But there's one thing I know for certain.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_95,"If we want her to choose an outfit for you,"
d_ex_clothingstore_06_96,you'll need to try on at least two sets.
d_ex_clothingstore_06_97,"Unfortunately, that seems almost impossible at the moment."
d_ex_clothingstore_06_98,Sooo...
d_ex_clothingstore_06_99,"Yep, it's time to pull the plug."
d_ex_workshop_06_title,The Figure of Dream
d_ex_workshop_06_1,*Zing*
d_ex_workshop_06_2,Is that you?
d_ex_workshop_06_3,Yes.
d_ex_workshop_06_4,...
d_ex_workshop_06_5,Is that all you've got to say? You're the one who called me over.
d_ex_workshop_06_6,Sorry.
d_ex_workshop_06_7,"It's just that I've got something on my mind. A glove, to be exact."
d_ex_workshop_06_8,It's a very special glove that isn't even sold on the market.
d_ex_workshop_06_9,"Ever since I saw it in the movies when I was a kid,"
d_ex_workshop_06_10,I always wanted to wear it.
d_ex_workshop_06_11,So I can't give up.
d_ex_workshop_06_12,A guy recommended this place to me.
d_ex_workshop_06_13,"Apparently, you can make just about anything there."
d_ex_workshop_06_14,Anything that you can imagine.
d_ex_workshop_06_15,That's basically how it happened.
d_ex_workshop_06_16,"You keep some awfully strange company, Greenhorn."
d_ex_workshop_06_17,...
d_ex_workshop_06_18,"A glove, was it?"
d_ex_workshop_06_19,"Setting aside the fact that you're asking me to craft something in this sweltering heat,"
d_ex_workshop_06_20,what kind of wacko item is this if you can't even buy it at a market?
d_ex_workshop_06_21,It's shaped like a hand.
d_ex_workshop_06_22,... As all gloves are.
d_ex_workshop_06_23,It's made of metal.
d_ex_workshop_06_24,So we're talking about a gauntlet?
d_ex_workshop_06_25,"No, you're totally off base."
d_ex_workshop_06_26,"Here, let me show you."
d_ex_workshop_06_27,*Scribble* *Scribble*
d_ex_workshop_06_28,Mast draws a crude sketch on her tablet.
d_ex_workshop_06_29,... Is this some form of abstract art?
d_ex_workshop_06_30,Are you trying to give me a brain aneurism? What am I supposed to make of this?
d_ex_workshop_06_31,??
d_ex_workshop_06_32,"Just a sec, let me try again."
d_ex_workshop_06_33,*Scribble* *Scribble*
d_ex_workshop_06_34,...
d_ex_workshop_06_35,It's somehow even worse...
d_ex_workshop_06_36,??
d_ex_workshop_06_37,Neither of you can tell what this is? It's so basic!
d_ex_workshop_06_38,I'm starting to get frustrated here.
d_ex_workshop_06_39,*Zing*
d_ex_workshop_06_40,What are all of you doing here?
d_ex_workshop_06_41,"I'm trying to get a customized glove made,"
d_ex_workshop_06_42,but these two can't make heads or tails of my drawing.
d_ex_workshop_06_43,What is it? Let me see.
d_ex_workshop_06_44,Yan walks up to the sketch.
d_ex_workshop_06_45,...
d_ex_workshop_06_46,"Ah, this!"
d_ex_workshop_06_47,"If this is what I think it is, I know all about it."
d_ex_workshop_06_48,We just got some in stock this morning.
d_ex_workshop_06_49,... What?
d_ex_workshop_06_50,Can you tell us what it is?
d_ex_workshop_06_51,"Oh, telling you would be easy enough,"
d_ex_workshop_06_52,"but you're going to be ordering it irregardless, I presume?"
d_ex_workshop_06_53,I'll just have someone bring it over.
d_ex_workshop_06_54,"In order to truly appreciate it for what it is, you've got to see it in person."
d_ex_workshop_06_55,A moment later.
d_ex_workshop_06_56,*Zing*
d_ex_workshop_06_57,"Here's the product you asked for, Boss."
d_ex_workshop_06_58,Very good. Bring it here.
d_ex_workshop_06_59,Is that a...?
d_ex_workshop_06_60,"As the Talentum Mall employee steps forward and lays down the product in their hands,"
d_ex_workshop_06_61,it is revealed to be... a metal ring meant for hanging curtains on.
d_ex_workshop_06_62,"This is what you wanted, right?"
d_ex_workshop_06_63,"It beats me as to why you'd want to outfit this into a glove,"
d_ex_workshop_06_64,"but the Outpost is chock full of weirdoes, so I didn't ask any questions."
d_ex_workshop_06_65,This... isn't quite what I was looking for.
d_ex_workshop_06_66,??
d_ex_workshop_06_67,What I wanted is a bit more...
d_ex_workshop_06_68,"curved, like a hook."
d_ex_workshop_06_69,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_06_70,What in the world are you talking about?
d_ex_workshop_06_71,Now you see why we were so confused.
d_ex_workshop_06_72,Why are we going through all this rigmarole in the first place?
d_ex_workshop_06_73,To make someone's childhood dream come true.
d_ex_workshop_06_74,You said it's more like a hook?
d_ex_workshop_06_75,Surely you're not talking about a fishing hook or something like that...
d_ex_workshop_06_76,... or are you?
d_ex_workshop_06_77,...
d_ex_workshop_06_78,"Forget it, it's easier if I just show you."
d_ex_workshop_06_79,I happen to have some. I'll have someone bring it.
d_ex_workshop_06_80,A moment later.
d_ex_workshop_06_81,...
d_ex_workshop_06_82,...
d_ex_workshop_06_83,...
d_ex_workshop_06_84,Feast your eyes on this.
d_ex_workshop_06_85,"This right here is something you'll only find at our store, and nowhere else."
d_ex_workshop_06_86,A limited-edition silver fishing hook meant for pro fishers.
d_ex_workshop_06_87,"On top of it being made of metal, it's the only curved hook available at the moment."
d_ex_workshop_06_88,...
d_ex_workshop_06_89,Hmm...
d_ex_workshop_06_90,Hmmmmm...
d_ex_workshop_06_91,"It's not exactly what I was looking for, but..."
d_ex_workshop_06_92,it has a similar feeling to the glove I dreamed of.
d_ex_workshop_06_93,Your dream was about being a fisherman? Not a pirate?
d_ex_workshop_06_94,What in the heck was your dream about?
d_ex_workshop_06_95,"All right, I'm officially checking out."
d_ex_workshop_06_96,You all come back to me when you've figured out what the hell you actually want.
d_ex_workshop_06_97,Yan proceeds to bring us a few more items to view.
d_ex_workshop_06_98,Delivery.
d_ex_workshop_06_99,What about this?
d_ex_workshop_06_100,Getting closer...
d_ex_workshop_06_101,"This has to be it, I'm sure of it."
d_ex_workshop_06_102,If only the part you put your fingers in was a tad bit smaller...
d_ex_workshop_06_103,A moment later.
d_ex_workshop_06_104,*Phew*
d_ex_workshop_06_105,*Phew*
d_ex_workshop_06_106,"You deserve a high five for this, Yan."
d_ex_workshop_06_107,"If you called this baby here the Legendary Pirate, Barb,"
d_ex_workshop_06_108,no one in their right mind would ever disagree.
d_ex_workshop_06_109,... I'm just glad you're satisfied.
d_ex_workshop_06_110,Isn't Barb famous?
d_ex_workshop_06_111,He is.
d_ex_workshop_06_112,He's the pirate with the prosthetic hand in the fairy tale.
d_ex_workshop_06_113,"That's right! Boy, there's nothing you don't know, Yan."
d_ex_workshop_06_114,Then how come we didn't search for that image from the beginning?
d_ex_workshop_06_115,...
d_ex_workshop_06_116,...
d_ex_workshop_06_117,I guess you do have a point there...
d_ex_workshop_06_118,"That's putting on the old thinking cap, Captain."
d_ex_workshop_06_119,...
d_ex_workshop_06_120,"But then again, if we'd done that,"
d_ex_workshop_06_121,"we wouldn't have gone on this madcap adventure,"
d_ex_workshop_06_122,and that's just not the proper pirate way.
d_ex_workshop_06_123,"Anyway, I think it's time I put this dream to rest now."
d_ex_workshop_06_124,"After all this, you're giving it up, just like that?"
d_ex_workshop_06_125,"Come on, you shouldn't put it like that."
d_ex_workshop_06_126,Don't think of it as an ordeal. Think of it more as an exciting adventure!
d_ex_workshop_06_127,...
d_ex_workshop_06_128,"If that's the case, then where's my money?"
d_ex_workshop_06_129,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_06_130,Don't adventurers get a reward after a successful adventure?
d_ex_workshop_06_131,"Uh... that's true, but..."
d_ex_workshop_06_132,"And, lest you forget, Rookie, Liter and I all don't come cheap."
d_ex_workshop_06_133,Er...
d_ex_workshop_06_134,"On top of that, you ordered custom-made materials, so that'll come at a premium as well."
d_ex_workshop_06_135,... C-Captain! Help!
d_ex_workshop_06_136,I think I'm in big trouble.
d_ex_workshop_06_137,"Sorry, Mast, but it's time to face the music."
d_ex_workshop_06_138,Having adventures and chasing one's dream is often a pricy venture.
d_ex_church_06_title,The Siren and the Song of Ruin
d_ex_church_06_1,"Captain,"
d_ex_church_06_2,have you ever heard about the Siren?
d_ex_church_06_3,It's a creature of the sea that seduces sailors.
d_ex_church_06_4,Never heard of it.
d_ex_church_06_5,I see you're well-versed in your sailor lore.
d_ex_church_06_6,Then you probably also know that the one creature
d_ex_church_06_7,I fear the most is the Siren. But I'm also really curious about it.
d_ex_church_06_8,It's a frightening sea creature with terrible powers.
d_ex_church_06_9,It sings this beautiful song that puts you under a spell.
d_ex_church_06_10,"Any sailor who hears it becomes infatuated,"
d_ex_church_06_11,"and jumps into the water to get near it, as if possessed."
d_ex_church_06_12,They are the bane of my existence.
d_ex_church_06_13,... Even though I've never seen one in real life.
d_ex_church_06_14,But!
d_ex_church_06_15,"Yesterday, we got wind of a sighting."
d_ex_church_06_16,According to the report:
d_ex_church_06_17,The entity spoken of in so many seafaring legends appeared at the Outpost's church.
d_ex_church_06_18,Its bloodthirsty song of destruction resounded throughout the air.
d_ex_church_06_19,Those who were seduced became mad and leaped into the abyss.
d_ex_church_06_20,Something tells me I know who wrote that.
d_ex_church_06_21,??
d_ex_church_06_22,"I'd never seen them before,"
d_ex_church_06_23,"but they seemed fairly chummy with Ingrid, so much so that they used nicknames."
d_ex_church_06_24,That tells me that they're at least somewhat trustworthy.
d_ex_church_06_25,That's why I dragged you over here so quickly.
d_ex_church_06_26,Let us embark on an exciting adventure together!
d_ex_church_06_27,... Heh.
d_ex_church_06_28,??
d_ex_church_06_29,Fools.
d_ex_church_06_30,Both of you.
d_ex_church_06_31,Wait... aren't you the person who told me about this place?
d_ex_church_06_32,That's right. The very same.
d_ex_church_06_33,"The name is Guillotine de Mephisto. 
Always call me by my full name when you address me."
d_ex_church_06_34,The Siren won't be showing its face right this moment.
d_ex_church_06_35,"You must wait 30 minutes,"
d_ex_church_06_36,"for at this very moment, she is at the Cavernous Abyss, causing bedlam."
d_ex_church_06_37,... What?
d_ex_church_06_38,Then why didn't you tell us to go there from the start?
d_ex_church_06_39,The reason is simple.
d_ex_church_06_40,"The entry fee to that place is 150,000 credits."
d_ex_church_06_41,Is that something you could afford?
d_ex_church_06_42,That price is a bit steep.
d_ex_church_06_43,It's highway robbery! That's what it is!
d_ex_church_06_44,I guess our adventure is over before it even began.
d_ex_church_06_45,"I've fraternized with my fair share of nobles, so I know all too well:"
d_ex_church_06_46,Capitalism is just as terrifying as any beast of the sea.
d_ex_church_06_47,*Slump*
d_ex_church_06_48,Mast sinks down at the edge of the bench.
d_ex_church_06_49,Very true.
d_ex_church_06_50,And that is the cheapest option available as well.
d_ex_church_06_51,*Slump*
d_ex_church_06_52,Guillotine plops down beside Mast.
d_ex_church_06_53,Sit beside Guillotine.
d_ex_church_06_54,Sit beside Mast.
d_ex_church_06_55,...
d_ex_church_06_56,"We sit in silence, waiting for the Siren to arrive."
d_ex_church_06_57,Soon after.
d_ex_church_06_58,*Creeeek*
d_ex_church_06_59,!!
d_ex_church_06_60,It's the Siren! Hide!
d_ex_church_06_61,*Crashh*
d_ex_church_06_62,"As we scurry behind the bench,"
d_ex_church_06_63,"the ""Siren"" makes its appearance."
d_ex_church_06_64,...
d_ex_church_06_65,Lalalala♪
d_ex_church_06_66,What a magnificent church.
d_ex_church_06_67,"Sound in here has such a unique echo, and the reverberation is second-to-none."
d_ex_church_06_68,I couldn't have found a better place to practice.
d_ex_church_06_69,I better get started.
d_ex_church_06_70,"Aria, or the ""Siren"", rather, takes a deep breath."
d_ex_church_06_71,"I am waiting for you, in that place where your reality has sunk."
d_ex_church_06_72,I am your dream.
d_ex_church_06_73,I am your love.
d_ex_church_06_74,"Come inside the water, 
I will drag you to the greatest depths where I reside!"
d_ex_church_06_75,...
d_ex_church_06_76,...
d_ex_church_06_77,...
d_ex_church_06_78,"I mean, it's a beautiful song."
d_ex_church_06_79,I've even got goosebumps.
d_ex_church_06_80,"But I don't feel like jumping into the ocean,"
d_ex_church_06_81,and I definitely don't feel any kind of seductive pull where I'd put my life in danger.
d_ex_church_06_82,*Gasp*
d_ex_church_06_83,Guillotine covers her mouth with both her hands.
d_ex_church_06_84,"Guillotine, are you okay?!"
d_ex_church_06_85,"Yeah, you all right, Guillotine... whatever it was?"
d_ex_church_06_86,"I'm fin... *cough, cough*"
d_ex_church_06_87,Urgh... it's just as I expected.
d_ex_church_06_88,What are you talking about?
d_ex_church_06_89,The Siren is real.
d_ex_church_06_90,She renders pitiable souls asunder with her demonic songs.
d_ex_church_06_91,Huh? I feel fine.
d_ex_church_06_92,As you should.
d_ex_church_06_93,That deadly ditty only affects those who share the same attributes as she.
d_ex_church_06_94,... Mast.
d_ex_church_06_95,Are you a fan of adventuring?
d_ex_church_06_96,Isn't the answer obvious? I'm a pirate who sails the high seas.
d_ex_church_06_97,"You thus represent adventure, not destruction."
d_ex_church_06_98,"Therefore, this Siren's lethal song, which embodies destruction,"
d_ex_church_06_99,has no sway over you.
d_ex_church_06_100,"As for people like myself, who do represent destruction... *gasp* Hrngh!"
d_ex_church_06_101,Guillotine covers her mouth with both hands again.
d_ex_church_06_102,Urgh... it's embarrassing to reveal my weaknesses to you both.
d_ex_church_06_103,"However, now that we've already come this far, there's only one thing left to do."
d_ex_church_06_104,"I'll need your help, Partner."
d_ex_church_06_105,What are you going to do?
d_ex_church_06_106,I am going to retrieve the Siren's true name.
d_ex_church_06_107,I don't understand.
d_ex_church_06_108,Allow me to explain.
d_ex_church_06_109,Have you ever heard of the idea that addressing a demon by their true name will be their undoing?
d_ex_church_06_110,The principle behind destroying the Siren is one and the same.
d_ex_church_06_111,Siren is merely a general appellation; each individual entity also has its own name.
d_ex_church_06_112,We must get her to write down her name with her own hand.
d_ex_church_06_113,In other words...
d_ex_church_06_114,*Flick*
d_ex_church_06_115,Guillotine pulls out two pieces of paper and a pen.
d_ex_church_06_116,"If we get her to imprint her true name, this will lead her down the path of her own demise."
d_ex_church_06_117,Where did you get such expensive paper?
d_ex_church_06_118,I placed an order through the Merchant Union.
d_ex_church_06_119,Do you think I'd go up against such a treacherous beast without proper preparation?
d_ex_church_06_120,... I see.
d_ex_church_06_121,"Now then, enough explanations."
d_ex_church_06_122,It's time to act.
d_ex_church_06_123,I wish you luck.
d_ex_church_06_124,...
d_ex_church_06_125,I don't know about this.
d_ex_church_06_126,"Do you think this will actually work, Captain?"
d_ex_church_06_127,...
d_ex_church_06_128,I suppose I'll give it a shot.
d_ex_church_06_129,"I stand up and move out from behind the bench towards the ""Siren""."
d_ex_church_06_130,?
d_ex_church_06_131,Maestro? I didn't know you were here.
d_ex_church_06_132,"If I knew I wasn't alone, I wouldn't have sung."
d_ex_church_06_133,"I didn't disrupt your praying, did I?"
d_ex_church_06_134,"No, not at all."
d_ex_church_06_135,"Actually, could I ask you to sign these for me?"
d_ex_church_06_136,??
d_ex_church_06_137,??
d_ex_church_06_138,"I met one of your fans who wanted your autograph,"
d_ex_church_06_139,but she was too shy to come and ask you herself.
d_ex_church_06_140,I see.
d_ex_church_06_141,"I typically only do autographs during signing events,"
d_ex_church_06_142,"but if they're friends of yours, I don't see any reason why I can't make an exception for you."
d_ex_church_06_143,Aria grabs the sheets of paper and scrawls her signature with a flourish.
d_ex_church_06_144,*Scratch scratch*
d_ex_church_06_145,Who should I make this out to?
d_ex_church_06_146,Guillotine.
d_ex_church_06_147,"Sorry, make that Guillotine de Mephisto."
d_ex_trainstation_06_title,Everyday Adventure
d_ex_trainstation_06_1,Isn't the entire purpose of a train station
d_ex_trainstation_06_2,so that you can ride a train to different locations?
d_ex_trainstation_06_3,How come you can't operate it here?
d_ex_trainstation_06_4,"No, no, no!"
d_ex_trainstation_06_5,How many times must I tell you?
d_ex_trainstation_06_6,It's not as if the train isn't operating because we don't want it to.
d_ex_trainstation_06_7,It's because the train tracks aren't connected.
d_ex_trainstation_06_8,... I'm still not getting it.
d_ex_trainstation_06_9,"Ugh... Commander, did you bring her here to annoy me on purpose?"
d_ex_trainstation_06_10,I brought her because I had faith that you could do something for us.
d_ex_trainstation_06_11,"I'm starting to regret it myself, to be honest..."
d_ex_trainstation_06_12,What are you talking about?
d_ex_trainstation_06_13,"Mast said she wanted to have a unique experience,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_14,and the first place that came to my mind was this train station.
d_ex_trainstation_06_15,What?
d_ex_trainstation_06_16,Then why don't you get her out of here?
d_ex_trainstation_06_17,"Mast said she wanted to have a unique experience,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_18,and so I wanted to show her how impressive this station is.
d_ex_trainstation_06_19,"If that's the case, why didn't you say so sooner?"
d_ex_trainstation_06_20,...
d_ex_trainstation_06_21,Very well.
d_ex_trainstation_06_22,This is going to push my professionalism as a train attendant to the limit.
d_ex_trainstation_06_23,Follow me. I'll give you a private tour.
d_ex_trainstation_06_24,??
d_ex_trainstation_06_25,I came here looking for adventure.
d_ex_trainstation_06_26,Didn't you just say that
d_ex_trainstation_06_27,there aren't any rails to ride?
d_ex_trainstation_06_28,How on earth are we gonna set out for a new location?
d_ex_trainstation_06_29,You mustn't be so parochial with your mindset.
d_ex_trainstation_06_30,Is riding a train or boat a prerequisite for adventure?
d_ex_trainstation_06_31,Uh...
d_ex_trainstation_06_32,Countless people come to visit this place.
d_ex_trainstation_06_33,"While they're here, they laugh and have a great time, and take countless photos."
d_ex_trainstation_06_34,Do you know why?
d_ex_trainstation_06_35,Because it's exciting to see something that differs from their everyday life.
d_ex_trainstation_06_36,Think about it. Is it common to have a station this well-kept without a track?
d_ex_trainstation_06_37,Definitely not.
d_ex_trainstation_06_38,Exactly. That's why people say
d_ex_trainstation_06_39,this seems like a place where trains soar through the sky.
d_ex_trainstation_06_40,"Some even say that this station feels like it's come out of a fairy tale, where time travel is possible."
d_ex_trainstation_06_41,So there you have it.
d_ex_trainstation_06_42,The very absence of certain things in fact stimulates the imagination.
d_ex_trainstation_06_43,You're quite the salesman today.
d_ex_trainstation_06_44,I tend to agree with you.
d_ex_trainstation_06_45,Not just today. I'm always like this.
d_ex_trainstation_06_46,"Anyway, my point is:"
d_ex_trainstation_06_47,As you should!
d_ex_trainstation_06_48,"Anyway,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_49,my point is:
d_ex_trainstation_06_50,We're not protecting this station for no reason.
d_ex_trainstation_06_51,It is our belief that one day this station will have tracks running through it.
d_ex_trainstation_06_52,"However, even now, we have a great amount of pride in what we do here."
d_ex_trainstation_06_53,We light up other people's lives.
d_ex_trainstation_06_54,...
d_ex_trainstation_06_55,"So, as you can see,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_56,you don't always have to look to faraway places for adventure.
d_ex_trainstation_06_57,...
d_ex_trainstation_06_58,Are you all right? You look troubled.
d_ex_trainstation_06_59,"No, it's nothing."
d_ex_trainstation_06_60,I've just never thought about this stuff before.
d_ex_trainstation_06_61,"Just like you tidy up this station every day,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_62,we also keep the Admire spick and span.
d_ex_trainstation_06_63,And there's a real meaning to all of it.
d_ex_trainstation_06_64,You were also spot on with the other thing.
d_ex_trainstation_06_65,You don't have to sail the high seas
d_ex_trainstation_06_66,or ride the rails to have a rousing adventure.
d_ex_trainstation_06_67,"So, what you're saying is..."
d_ex_trainstation_06_68,Could you show me around this place a little more?
d_ex_trainstation_06_69,I want to experience the sense of adventure that resides within everyday life.
d_ex_trainstation_06_70,!!
d_ex_trainstation_06_71,Of course!
d_ex_trainstation_06_72,"Our station may look impressive from the outside, but that's not all. We have plenty of additional information inside as well."
d_ex_trainstation_06_73,"Exhibits covering the history of the Ark Express's construction,"
d_ex_trainstation_06_74,and the various iterations it went through.
d_ex_trainstation_06_75,All with plenty of visual aids.
d_ex_trainstation_06_76,We also have a spot where you can take a photo with the train.
d_ex_trainstation_06_77,Very impressive.
d_ex_trainstation_06_78,"I'm proud of you, Soline."
d_ex_trainstation_06_79,"Thanks, hehe."
d_ex_trainstation_06_80,Why are you talking like that? I'm not a child.
d_ex_trainstation_06_81,And also...
d_ex_trainstation_06_82,"*Rustle, rustle*"
d_ex_trainstation_06_83,Soline unwraps a candy and pops it into Mast's mouth.
d_ex_trainstation_06_84,It's so sweet! What is it?
d_ex_trainstation_06_85,A strawberry candy I pilfered from Diesel's desk.
d_ex_trainstation_06_86,"They're a big hit with visitors, and can lift their spirits, so I try and hand them out often."
d_ex_trainstation_06_87,Can I have one too?
d_ex_trainstation_06_88,Seriously? You're interested in candy too?
d_ex_trainstation_06_89,"*Rustle, rustle*"
d_ex_trainstation_06_90,I unwrap the candy and give it to Soline.
d_ex_trainstation_06_91,!!
d_ex_trainstation_06_92,*Crunch crunch* Delicious.
d_ex_trainstation_06_93,Moving on to the exhibit...
d_ex_trainstation_06_94,*Crunch crunch* Sure.
d_ex_trainstation_06_95,So we can see what it was like there at the beginning of the Outpost?
d_ex_trainstation_06_96,I've always been curious about how a place like this started out.
d_ex_trainstation_06_97,"Of course, we have a short video that plays every 5 minutes."
d_ex_trainstation_06_98,Soline and Mast happily walk off while munching on their candy.
d_ex_trainstation_06_99,...
d_ex_trainstation_06_100,I want to be part of this adventure too.
d_ex_observationpost_06_title,Nose Like a Bloodhound vs. Radar
d_ex_observationpost_06_1,"As I made a quick stop at the Observatory to pick up something,"
d_ex_observationpost_06_2,I ran into a face I didn't see there often.
d_ex_observationpost_06_3,Anchor?
d_ex_observationpost_06_4,Hello Captain.
d_ex_observationpost_06_5,What are you doing here?
d_ex_observationpost_06_6,I'm looking for something I lost.
d_ex_observationpost_06_7,"Mast said this was the most likely place where I could find it,"
d_ex_observationpost_06_8,"but there isn't anyone here, and I'm not picking up anything on my radar."
d_ex_observationpost_06_9,She's so full of it.
d_ex_observationpost_06_10,What did you lose?
d_ex_observationpost_06_11,...
d_ex_observationpost_06_12,My precious...
d_ex_observationpost_06_13,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_06_14,Ow...
d_ex_observationpost_06_15,Oh!
d_ex_observationpost_06_16,"Hey, you two!"
d_ex_observationpost_06_17,Is something wrong?
d_ex_observationpost_06_18,"Oh, er..."
d_ex_observationpost_06_19,"That's obvious, huh?"
d_ex_observationpost_06_20,*Sigh*
d_ex_observationpost_06_21,There's this bracelet I've been wearing a lot recently.
d_ex_observationpost_06_22,It was an amulet that I made using some gifts that the animals at the shelter gave me. It was truly one-of-a-kind.
d_ex_observationpost_06_23,"I was so afraid of losing it, that I brought it to the workshop and had them make some special modifications to it."
d_ex_observationpost_06_24,"And after all that, I lost it anyway..."
d_ex_observationpost_06_25,Modifications?
d_ex_observationpost_06_26,Yes!
d_ex_observationpost_06_27,"It's connected to my cellphone, so if I were to lose it, it emits the sound of Max whining."
d_ex_observationpost_06_28,"Pretty nifty, huh?"
d_ex_observationpost_06_29,"You should have seen it, it was spectacular*sob*"
d_ex_observationpost_06_30,"I've gone over the Outpost and the Ark with a fine-tooth comb, but I haven't heard a single peep."
d_ex_observationpost_06_31,So I figured I might as well give the Observatory a shot.
d_ex_observationpost_06_32,"If it's connected to your cellphone,"
d_ex_observationpost_06_33,I should be able to pick up the signal.
d_ex_observationpost_06_34,One second.
d_ex_observationpost_06_35,Anchor places her hand on the detection device.
d_ex_observationpost_06_36,Whoa!
d_ex_observationpost_06_37,Do you feel something?
d_ex_observationpost_06_38,"Yes, but it's a much different feeling than usual."
d_ex_observationpost_06_39,It's like I'm sensing everything that the detector is picking up.
d_ex_observationpost_06_40,I should be able to find your bracelet no problem.
d_ex_observationpost_06_41,Re-really?!
d_ex_observationpost_06_42,Yeah.
d_ex_observationpost_06_43,"Hold on, wait."
d_ex_observationpost_06_44,Anchor closes her eyes and starts to concentrate.
d_ex_observationpost_06_45,...
d_ex_observationpost_06_46,There you are.
d_ex_observationpost_06_47,Found it.
d_ex_observationpost_06_48,The signal is quite faint.
d_ex_observationpost_06_49,It's directly in front of the elevator that connects to the Outpost.
d_ex_observationpost_06_50,Sometimes I impress even myself.
d_ex_observationpost_06_51,Yahoo!
d_ex_observationpost_06_52,"I can't thank you enough, Anchor."
d_ex_observationpost_06_53,You have no idea how much that bracelet means to me.
d_ex_observationpost_06_54,You're welcome.
d_ex_observationpost_06_55,"Did you say you lost something as well, Anchor?"
d_ex_observationpost_06_56,Ah...
d_ex_observationpost_06_57,I did.
d_ex_observationpost_06_58,"My precious starfish has gone missing,"
d_ex_observationpost_06_59,and my radar hasn't been any help in finding it.
d_ex_observationpost_06_60,I don't know what to do...
d_ex_observationpost_06_61,Ah!
d_ex_observationpost_06_62,Did you say starfish?
d_ex_observationpost_06_63,Does it by any chance have a really unctuous fishy smell?
d_ex_observationpost_06_64,!!
d_ex_observationpost_06_65,"I'd assume it would, yes."
d_ex_observationpost_06_66,I've never given it a proper whiff myself.
d_ex_observationpost_06_67,I think I might know where it is.
d_ex_observationpost_06_68,It's in Trainer's room.
d_ex_observationpost_06_69,You mean the Commander's Room?
d_ex_observationpost_06_70,Yep.
d_ex_observationpost_06_71,You know how I ran into you earlier today?
d_ex_observationpost_06_72,"Well, when I did, I thought it was a bit strange, because I was picking up a weird odor that isn't normally there."
d_ex_observationpost_06_73,"I thought maybe you'd left something under the bed, but either way, it was enough to curl your nose hairs."
d_ex_observationpost_06_74,"Oh, dear..."
d_ex_observationpost_06_75,It must have escaped when I was talking to Captain.
d_ex_observationpost_06_76,I didn't even think to check there.
d_ex_observationpost_06_77,"Thanks, Biscuit."
d_ex_observationpost_06_78,"No, thank you!"
d_ex_observationpost_06_79,"At this point, I've forgotten what I came to the Observatory for in the first place, and leave."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_title,Take a Deep Breath and Dive
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_1,*Gasp*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_2,*Tick*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_3,25 seconds.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_4,That's 5 more seconds than in the beginning.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_5,Huh? That's it?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_6,It felt like I was under there for a minute at least.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_7,Is that timer broken?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_8,"The weather was particularly sweltering today, so I walked over to the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_9,"When I arrived, I saw Anis and Helm hanging out in the water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_10,"Hey, Anis."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_11,"Hey, Helm."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_12,"Hey, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_13,You coming to the pool for a swim?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_14,"Hey, Subordinate."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_15,Have you come here to take a dip?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_16,"Yeah, the weather is brutal today, so I decided to head to the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_17,What are you two up to?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_18,Anis asked me to teach her how to hold her breath underwater.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_19,Why are you so interested in this all of a sudden?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_20,"You know I sink like a stone when I try to swim,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_21,so I figured the least I could do was learn to hold my breath for longer.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_22,"I've been at it for the past three hours though, and it's way harder than it looks."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_23,"How long can you hold your breath underwater, Commander?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_24,"I can do a minute, easy-peasy."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_25,I'm like a fish underwater.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_26,"Really?
A whole minute?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_27,"Uh-huh. How, very, very incredible."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_28,"... If you're gonna pretend to be impressed, you could at least smile while you do it."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_29,What do you mean? I am smiling.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_30,See?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_31,"Anis' deadpan expression turns into a smile, albeit only in response to me being miffed by her initial response."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_32,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_33,How about a little competition?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_34,We can see who can hold their breath the longest: Anis or Subordinate.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_35,Are you sure that's a good idea?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_36,It'll help you more than just practicing on your own.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_37,Anis' best time so far has been 25 seconds.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_38,25 seconds is nothing.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_39,I've got this in the bag.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_40,"Oh, is that so?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_41,You think you can take me?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_42,"Fine, how about we make this interesting?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_43,Let's make a wager.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_44,Fine by me.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_45,"If I win, then you need to buy me 100 cans of soda."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_46,And if I win?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_47,If you win...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_48,I'll do anything you want.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_49,Anything?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_50,How come you're laughing so creepily like that?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_51,What in the world is going through your mind?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_52,"Let's just get this show on the road. Helm, could you be the referee?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_53,Sure.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_54,"As soon as I blow the whistle, 
the both of you will submerge yourselves."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_55,Get ready... set...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_56,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_57,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_58,*Beep*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_59,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_60,"At Helm's signal, Anis and I dunk our heads underwater."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_61,*Gurgle gurgle*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_62,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_63,How much time has passed?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_64,It must have been a minute by now.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_65,More than enough to beat Anis.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_66,*Gasp*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_67,Hmm...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_68,32 seconds.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_69,?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_70,I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_71,You didn't last as long as I thought you would.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_72,There's no way that was only 32 seconds...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_73,Anis is still holding her breath.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_74,"Anis, you can come up now."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_75,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_76,Anis?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_77,Helm shakes Anis but she doesn't budge.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_78,!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_79,!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_80,Anis!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_81,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_82,I think she's fainted!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_83,"Help me get her out of the pool,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_84,quick!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_85,Okay!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_86,Hrrrngh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_87,"I try to lift up Anis, but..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_88,... Ughhhh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_89,"I thought the water would make her more buoyant, but it feels like she weighs a ton."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_90,Let me get her out.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_91,You go ahead and put a blanket down.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_92,"Helm lifts Anis out of the swimming pool, places her on the ground, then brings her ear near Anis' face."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_93,She's not breathing!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_94,!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_95,Anis? Anis!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_96,*Slap*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_97,*Slap* *Slap*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_98,There's no reaction from Anis.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_99,"We need to do something, quick."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_100,I'll do CPR.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_101,You get in touch with Mary.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_102,Okay.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_103,I lean Anis' head back and lift her chin up.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_104,*Inhale*
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_105,"I take a deep breath and lean in closer to Anis, when..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_106,Tah-dah!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_107,Eek!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_108,Gah!
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_109,Anis opens her eyes.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_110,Wh-what?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_111,Was... that all a practical joke?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_112,Of course not. Do you think I'd joke about a thing like that?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_113,I came to when you were
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_114,giving my face the ol' one-two.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_115,You make it sound like I was beating you...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_116,I'm just teasin'. Thanks.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_117,"If it weren't for you,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_118,I'd be hanging out in the afterlife right about now.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_119,Are you okay?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_120,I think so.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_121,Good.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_122,You scared me half to death.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_123,I'm just glad nothing bad happened.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_124,"Yeah yeah, sure, but more importantly,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_125,this means the Commander lost.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_126,"He got out of the water first,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_127,right?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_128,I... guess you're right?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_129,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_130,"Yahoo! 100 sodas, here I come!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_131,"Thanks a bunch, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_132,"Tough break, Commander..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_133,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_134,Totally worth passing out for a sec.
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_135,Which flavor should I get?
d_ex_outdoorpool_05_136,I accompany Anis to go buy her some sodas.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_title,Paper Boat Race
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_1,Come on!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_2,Put your back into it!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_3,?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_4,"As I walked by the swimming pool, I noticed it was noisier than usual."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_5,"As I stepped in, I witnessed a sight unlike anything I'd seen before."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_6,"My ship can never lag behind,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_7,for it is the almighty Jack Lowe Admire Aegis Mast!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_8,I still think that name is too long.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_9,Why don't you just admit defeat?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_10,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_11,Never!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_12,I demand one more match!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_13,What are you two doing?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_14,Commander!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_15,"Hey, Captain."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_16,We were having a paper boat race.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_17,How exactly does that work?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_18,Let me explain.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_19,"You fold a piece of paper into a boat,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_20,then plop it into the swimming pool so that it floats.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_21,"Once you've done that, you either use your hands to make waves, or your mouth to blow air and make the boat move forward."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_22,"Whoever goes the furthest wins. You yourself can't move though, and you're disqualified if your boat topples over or sinks."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_23,And I just won!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_24,The Jack Lowe Admire Aegis Mast is unstoppable!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_25,"I'm telling you, you have to shorten that name."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_26,"Since you're here,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_27,"why don't you join us, Captain?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_28,Me?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_29,"Oh, that could be fun!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_30,You want to give it a try? We've got plenty of paper on hand.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_31,"Okay, sure."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_32,I take a piece of paper and fold it according to Anis and Mast's instructions.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_33,"Before long, I've crafted an adorable little boat."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_34,Did you say this was your first time making a paper boat?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_35,You're better at this than I expected.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_36,Now comes the important part.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_37,What's that?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_38,Christening your ship with a meaningful name.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_39,Are we ever going to get this race underway...?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_40,"What kind of name are you gonna bestow upon your boat,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_41,Captain?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_42,"By the way, in case you didn't know, my boat's name is the Jack Lowe..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_43,Too long! Shorter!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_44,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_45,It's called The Mast.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_46,I'll call my boat...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_47,The Super Duper Ark Shark Hurricane Ultra Commander {AccountData.NickName} Ship.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_48,The {AccountData.NickName}.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_49,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_50,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_51,Too long! Shorter!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_52,"... Okay, just The {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_53,Better.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_54,Sounds to me like you got some inspiration from my boat's name.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_55,It's fine. Nice and simple. Rolls right off the tongue.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_56,"What's your boat's name, Anis?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_57,Mine?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_58,Paper Boat.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_59,Not the wittiest of names.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_60,"I'd never attach such a dispassionate name to my dear, beloved ship."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_61,Why are you so obsessed with the name anyway?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_62,"Okay, everyone lies down in front of the swimming pool shoulder-to-shoulder."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_63,Place your boats on the starting line.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_64,"The current may cause it to move slightly before the race begins,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_65,so be sure to use your hands to keep them in place until we start.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_66,"Following Mast and Anis' instructions, I place my boat atop the water and lightly pinch the end of the boat with my fingers."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_67,"Now,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_68,get ready...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_69,set...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_70,Go!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_71,*Pfoooo* *Pfooooo*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_72,*Pfoooooooo*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_73,"Mast lets out short bursts of air,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_74,whereas Anis lets out longer breaths.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_75,As for me...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_76,Blow with your mouth.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_77,Lap at the water with your hands.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_78,*Inhale*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_79,"I take a deep breath, filling my lungs with as much air as possible,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_80,*Pfooooooooo*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_81,and then letting all the air out.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_82,Whoa!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_83,No way!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_84,"The {AccountData.NickName} surges past The Mast and Paper Boat, quickly securing the lead."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_85,*Splash* *Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_86,"I frantically flop my hands in the water, creating small waves."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_87,"The waves spread out,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_88,causing The Mast and Paper Boat to become unstable.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_89,"No, not The Mast!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_90,"So you're playing dirty, are you?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_91,I won't go down so easily.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_92,You've left me with no choice.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_93,Full speed ahead!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_94,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_95,Mast waggles her hands vigorously.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_96,"Wait, no!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_97,The waves that Mast produces end up scuttling her own ship.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_98,It's sinking!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_99,Not The Mast!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_100,It can't end like this!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_101,Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_102,I can't believe this...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_103,That's one down.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_104,"Just when you least expect it, that's when I strike!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_105,"Time to unveil my hidden trump card, especially designed to take you down."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_106,?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_107,"As I turn my head toward Anis' direction,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_108,"I see that she has unzipped the top portion of her jacket,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_109,and is now provocatively leaning forward.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_110,"As if they have a mind of their own,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_111,my eyes are drawn toward Anis' newly revealed assets.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_112,...!!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_113,"Don't fall for it, Captain!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_114,Stay strong and avenge The Mast!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_115,Ha!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_116,It'll never happen!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_117,Anis dunks her hands in the water and moves them to and fro.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_118,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_119,"The resulting cascade of waves propels her ship forward,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_120,while causing mine to veer off-course.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_121,No!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_122,Haha! I win!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_123,What on earth was that trickery?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_124,What do you mean trickery? You were here the entire time.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_125,I didn't do anything.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_126,"If you didn't do anything, then how come the Captain looks so wound up?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_127,Beats me.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_128,I can't help it if he's mesmerized by my looks.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_129,What's that supposed to mean?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_130,Erm... I just remembered I have something urgent to take care of.
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_131,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_132,How come you're hunched over like that?
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_133,"A true pirate should stand tall and proud, with their head held high."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_134,"All right all right, he said it was urgent, so let him go."
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_135,"Safe travels, Commander!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_136,Fine...
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_137,"How about one final rematch, Anis?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_138,Would you give it up?!
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_139,"Against the backdrop of Anis and Mast bickering,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_06_140,"I quietly slink away from the swimming pool, hunched over."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_title,Water Quality Test
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_1,*Creaaaak*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_2,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_3,"Oh, hey Commander, hey Anchor."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_4,What are you two up to?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_5,Hey.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_6,I'm here for a routine inspection.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_7,Inspection?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_8,Does that mean we can't use the swimming pool?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_9,"Not for the moment, no."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_10,Just my luck.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_11,I was looking forward to dipping my feet in the water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_12,When do you think you'll be done?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_13,We just need to do a water quality test.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_14,That shouldn't take too long.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_15,Ah.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_16,Would you like to help?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_17,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_18,Is there something you need help with?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_19,Wait just a moment.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_20,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_21,Anchor hops into the swimming pool.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_22,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_23,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_24,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_25,I'm finished with the water quality test.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_26,No issues. It's clean.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_27,"All right, I'll check it off the list."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_28,What the...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_29,"You're finished already, just like that?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_30,Yep.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_31,We conduct the check using our bodies.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_32,The water is exactly 26.2 degrees Celsius.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_33,The hydrogen ion concentration is 6.0.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_34,Turbidity is 0.9 NTU.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_35,There are no coliforms.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_36,Should I go on?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_37,Er... no thanks.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_38,This is really interesting though.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_39,Your body is perfectly adapted to water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_40,"Oh, right."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_41,What was it that you needed my help with?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_42,I'll need both of you to get in the water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_43,What?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_44,I can't do that.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_45,"The pool isn't filled all the way yet, so it shouldn't be a problem for you."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_46,Are you sure?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_47,"Positive. When I just was in there, I was able to stand up."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_48,"Oh, I thought you were just bobbing in the water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_49,"In that case, I'm going in!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_50,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_51,"Come on in, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_52,Okay.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_53,Make a cannonball.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_54,Gingerly dip my toes in.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_55,I back up...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_56,rush towards the pool...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_57,"and am just about to do a wicked cannonball, when..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_58,Don't!
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_59,The water is too shallow to be diving in like that.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_60,Oh...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_61,I instead sit on the edge and hop in normally.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_62,*Plunk*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_63,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_64,Are you afraid of the water or something? You're making me feel self-conscious for jumping in.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_65,"At any rate, I get into the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_66,Now what?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_67,Splash each other with water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_68,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_69,Awesome! I'm a professional at this kinda thing.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_70,Hehe!
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_71,"Anis traces an arc through the water, sending a mini-torrent of water my way."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_72,I can't just sit and take this abuse.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_73,*Splash* *Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_74,"Eek! Have mercy, Commander! Haha!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_75,"You didn't go easy on me, so you're getting the full treatment!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_76,*Splash* *Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_77,"*Phew* This is a total blast, but I'm getting kinda tired..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_78,"Ready or not, here I come!"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_79,Agghh!
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_80,*Splash* *Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_81,*Pffff*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_82,*Phew*
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_83,Anchor... how long do we have to keep this up?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_84,I'm pooped.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_85,Ah?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_86,"Oh, I thought you two were having fun."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_87,Huh?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_88,You're the one who told us to do this.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_89,Isn't this for some kind of test?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_90,The test ended the moment both of you got in the water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_91,"Neither of you had any issues, the test went smoothly."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_92,"I knew you had wanted to hang out by the pool,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_93,so I proposed that you two splash each other with water.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_94,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_95,I take it this means you're finished?
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_96,"If so, could you both get out so I can fill up the pool all the way?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_97,... I don't even have the strength to get into it with you right now.
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_98,"Let's go, Commander."
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_99,Right...
d_ex_outdoorpool_07_100,"Anis and I drag ourselves out of the pool, worn out to the point of exhaustion."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_title,The Thing in the Water
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_1,"Whatever it was,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_2,it was definitely squishy.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_3,Just thinking back on it gives me the creeps.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_4,"I hear what you're saying, but"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_5,I can't pick up anything on my radar.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_6,"Not a trace of anything in the pool, either."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_7,We've been fishing for an hour and we haven't caught anything.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_8,Are you sure you weren't just imagining things?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_9,"Impossible. It felt so real, and I heard it hit the water."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_10,What are you two doing?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_11,!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_12,"Where did you come from,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_13,Subordinate?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_14,"I was on patrol and heard some suspicious noises, so I came by."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_15,"I see. Well, Anchor and I are looking for sea creatures in the pool."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_16,Come again?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_17,"When I was cleaning the pool, I ended up netting something that was squishy."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_18,I was so startled that I threw it back into the pool...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_19,You didn't see what it was?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_20,No... I was so terrified that my eyes were glued shut the entire time.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_21,But I definitely heard the water splash.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_22,"If I had to guess, I'd say it might have been a sea cucumber or an anemone."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_23,Hurling it into the water like that was uncalled for.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_24,"Yeah, you didn't have to do that."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_25,I feel bad for the sea creature.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_26,It's not like I feel great about it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_27,It was a reflex...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_28,"You don't think I hurt it, do you?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_29,"They live in the water anyway, so it should be okay."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_30,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_31,"I'm telling you Helm,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_32,"there are absolutely, positively no sea creatures in here."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_33,It wouldn't make any sense for them to be here in the first place.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_34,I think we can continue with our cleaning.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_35,But what if it shows up again?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_36,It'll be fine.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_37,They're not like cockroaches that can scurry off at mach speed.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_38,"As long as you don't touch them, they won't even move."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_39,"If you do chance upon it again,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_40,just let me know instead of throwing it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_41,I'll put it in a box with my other sea creatures.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_42,... Okay.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_43,"All right, I'll see you later."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_44,Me too.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_45,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_46,Um...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_47,...??
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_48,"Helm leans against me and Anchor, tugging at our respective shirt sleeves."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_49,... Um.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_50,I don't have much cleaning left.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_51,Is it okay if we all leave together in a bit?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_52,"It's just that it'd be boring to clean alone, that's all."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_53,And also...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_54,Also...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_55,Also what?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_56,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_57,"Fine, I'm no good at implication, so I'll just say it outright."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_58,I have no idea when or if that sea creature will make another appearance.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_59,"If you can just stay with me in the meantime, I'd really appreciate it."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_60,"... Captain, what should we do?"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_61,I've never seen Helm so beside herself.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_62,She's really scared stiff.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_63,"I-I'm not scared, it's just..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_64,I'd rather not have to look at it again.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_65,"Sorry, but I'm busy."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_66,I can stay. I don't mind.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_67,I'll try to finish cleaning as soon as I can.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_68,The desperation in Helm's eyes is palpable.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_69,Got it.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_70,"Okay, then the Captain and I..."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_71,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_72,??
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_73,??
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_74,??
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_75,Did you guys hear that too?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_76,I don't see anything in the water though...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_77,Am I the only one?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_78,I heard it too.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_79,And I can't see anything either.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_80,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_81,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_82,Er...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_83,Hold up.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_84,"Captain, Helm."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_85,My radar's picking up something unusual.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_86,"1 o'clock, 100 meters out."
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_87,Helm and I turn to face towards 1 o'clock.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_88,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_89,...
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_90,It's the same direction where we heard the sound.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_91,"I'm not sure what it is,"
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_92,but I don't think it's alive.
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_93,So that means... what I grabbed might not have been a sea creature?
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_94,*Splash*
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_95,...??

d_ex_outdoorpool_08_100,!!
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_101,Let's get out of here!
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_102,You don't have to tell me twice!
d_ex_outdoorpool_08_103,We decide not to enter the pool for a while.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_title,I Like the Softness
d_ex_seayouagain_01_1,"Frima sits next to a broken hammock, staring into space."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_2,What happened to your hammock?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_3,Volt. Surprise attack.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_4,Need new one.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_5,*Stare*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_6,Frima stares at me with an unnerving intensity.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_7,Want soft one.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_8,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_9,I go out to find the materials Frima requested.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_10,"During my search, I run into Anchor, who is fishing."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_11,"Hey, Captain."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_12,Did you come to fish?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_13,"No, I'm on the hunt for soft materials."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_14,No kidding? I might have just the thing you're looking for.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_15,Don't tell me it's a fish...
d_ex_seayouagain_01_16,It's not a fish.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_17,"No sea cucumbers and sea anemones, either."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_18,"No sea squirts or starfish, either."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_19,"It's neither of those, either."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_20,Just sit tight.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_21,*Rustle* *Rustle*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_22,Anchor takes out something from the bucket of sea creatures and hands it to me.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_23,What is this?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_24,A sponge crab.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_25,It's super soft. Take it.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_26,*Poke*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_27,Anchor wasn't lying. It's soft as a cloud.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_28,Could I use this as a pillow?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_29,Sure you could.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_30,Its entire back is essentially a furry sponge.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_31,Wouldn't it be dangerous since it has claws?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_32,It'll be fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_33,"As long as you don't move, it won't pinch you."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_34,...
d_ex_seayouagain_01_35,A moment later.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_36,I brought you something.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_37,They're as soft as can be.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_38,What?
d_ex_seayouagain_01_39,Let me see.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_40,I laid out a group of sponge crabs in the requested location.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_41,*Poke* *Poke*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_42,*Bounce*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_43,Frima gives a contented smile after poking at the sponge crab.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_44,Good.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_45,Now sleep.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_46,*Thud*
d_ex_seayouagain_01_47,Zzzz...
d_ex_seayouagain_01_48,"Frima has laid out the group of sponge crabs as an impromptu bed, and fallen fast asleep."
d_ex_seayouagain_01_49,Never would guess that would actually work.
d_ex_seayouagain_01_50,... It's kinda creepy.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_title,Morgan vs Volt
d_ex_seayouagain_02_1,"Hey, Volt! Bring it back!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_2,*Swoosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_3,"The moment Liter hurls the frisbee,"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_4,Woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_5,*Taptaptap*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_6,Volt takes off like a rocket and intercepts it.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_7,Morgan can do that too.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_8,"Go, Morgan!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_9,*Swoosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_10,"The moment Mast hurls the frisbee,"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_11,*Kheeek*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_12,Morgan takes off like a rocket and intercepts it.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_13,That parrot is pretty good.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_14,Volt's not too bad either.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_15,What are you guys up to?
d_ex_seayouagain_02_16,"Oh, hey Captain. You came at the perfect time."
d_ex_seayouagain_02_17,We were just about to do our last match.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_18,Is there some kind of competition?
d_ex_seayouagain_02_19,There sure is:
d_ex_seayouagain_02_20,to determine whether Volt or Morgan is smarter!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_21,"Up until now, it's been a tie."
d_ex_seayouagain_02_22,The next match will decide everything.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_23,"I'll admit that this parrot is talented,"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_24,"but it'll never best Volt, not in a million years!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_25,Ha! You'll be eating those words soon enough.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_26,"Please, this last match is practically a foregone conclusion."
d_ex_seayouagain_02_27,"Greenhorn, would you like to watch it before you go?"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_28,Sure.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_29,"Tell me, Captain, who do you think is going to win?"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_30,Volt.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_31,Morgan.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_32,Good answer.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_33,See? Greenhorn knows how it is.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_34,"I appreciate the support, Captain!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_35,"Morgan will bring us victory, I'm sure of it!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_36,"All right, what's the next task?"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_37,Riding a two-meter wave without any equipment.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_38,Isn't that a bit dangerous?
d_ex_seayouagain_02_39,"Maybe, but only a truly difficult skill like this would be worth constituting the final match. Let's go, Volt!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_40,Woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_41,"Tally ho, Morgan!"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_42,Keeeeeeeeeak!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_43,Nothing I say will get through to them. They're consumed by the desire for victory.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_44,While I was attempting to come up with some way to dissuade them...
d_ex_seayouagain_02_45,*Schlap* *Schlap*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_46,*Splat*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_47,*Eeep*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_48,*Crawwwwww*
d_ex_seayouagain_02_49,Several starfish come flying and land smack dab on Volt and Morgans' faces.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_50,Volt!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_51,Morgan! Get it together!
d_ex_seayouagain_02_52,"Captain,"
d_ex_seayouagain_02_53,I thought giving them a good whack would calm 'em down.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_54,"Looking around, the situation has indeed calmed down."
d_ex_seayouagain_02_55,I give a thumbs up to Anchor as she approaches me.
d_ex_seayouagain_02_56,Starfish for the win.

d_ex_seayouagain_03_1,Your perseverance is remarkable.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_2,"You came all the way out here, and you're still working?"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_3,...
d_ex_seayouagain_03_4,Amazing!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_5,Have you ever considered that you might be a workaholic?
d_ex_seayouagain_03_6,Would you two can it?! I'm trying to work.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_7,I've gotta keep my hands nimble so that I don't lose my touch.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_8,Cool!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_9,Truly the mind of a master.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_10,Whatever you say.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_11,"Anyhoo, does this mean you're accepting orders?"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_12,Was there something you wanted?
d_ex_seayouagain_03_13,Yep!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_14,A whole bunch actually.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_15,Just tell me one.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_16,Fine...
d_ex_seayouagain_03_17,"To be honest, I really want to go to the sea."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_18,Ah ha!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_19,"You want her to make you an inner tube, don't you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_20,Why didn't you just tell me you were jealous? I'd have given you a ride on mine.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_21,I don't want any stinkin' inner tube!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_22,"Those are for kids, and besides, they're a pain in the butt to haul around all the time."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_23,Isn't there anything a bit more modern and convenient that you can make for me?
d_ex_seayouagain_03_24,What? You've got no idea how comfortable an inner tube can be.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_25,"All you've got to do is place it around your waist, and viola! You're done."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_26,"Maybe your hips aren't wide enough, and it ends up sliding down?"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_27,That's not it!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_28,That's enough from the peanut gallery!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_29,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_03_30,How about a surfboard?
d_ex_seayouagain_03_31,You ought to be able to carry that around with just one hand.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_32,"Ooh, that could work!"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_33,"Okay, I've got some leftover wood from the boat I made, so I can whip something up for you."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_34,Just give me some time.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_35,A moment later.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_36,Liter hands over a newly furbished surfboard to Anis.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_37,"Wow, awesome!"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_38,There's a reason why they say you're the best.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_39,Thanks a bunch! I'm gonna get a lotta use out of this thing.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_40,It's so smooth! So pretty!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_41,I wanna take it for a spin too.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_42,Anis and Neon excitedly sprint toward the sea.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_43,Those who are always making such a ruckus.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_44,Aren't you going to join them?
d_ex_seayouagain_03_45,"You do realize you're on vacation, don't you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_46,"Oh, hey Greenhorn."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_47,"If my hands rest too long, they'll get rusty."
d_ex_seayouagain_03_48,There are other ways to enjoy yourself without resting your hands.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_49,Huh? Like wha... Agh!
d_ex_seayouagain_03_50,*Splash*
d_ex_seayouagain_03_51,"I fire at Liter with a squirt gun,"
d_ex_seayouagain_03_52,then hand her a similar weapon.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_53,Use this.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_54,You can kill two birds with one stone.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_55,I can't believe
d_ex_seayouagain_03_56,you're actually encouraging me to horse around.
d_ex_seayouagain_03_57,You don't think I'd actually fall for th...Argh!

d_ex_seayouagain_03_59,I scored a direct hit to Liter's face.

d_ex_seayouagain_03_66,I'll get you for this!

d_ex_seayouagain_04_12,Big trouble. Tired.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_13,"With great strain, Frima lifts herself up and looks for a new place to sleep."
d_ex_seayouagain_04_14,Frima is laying down in one of the clinic's beach chairs.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_15,Hmm...

d_ex_seayouagain_04_18,What are you doing here?
d_ex_seayouagain_04_19,Are you not feeling well?
d_ex_seayouagain_04_20,No.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_21,Feeling all wrong.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_22,Going.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_23,Frima leaves the clinic.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_24,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_04_25,Frima lazes on the sofa in the log cabin.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_26,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_04_27,...

d_ex_seayouagain_04_31,"There we were, having a ball, and then whammo! Big ol' gusts of wind."
d_ex_seayouagain_04_32,Totally.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_33,It really brought the mood down.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_34,Frima gets up from the sofa.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_35,Not it either.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_36,Gah!

d_ex_seayouagain_04_48,Frima rushes towards the hammock as it's a loved one she hasn't seen in years.
d_ex_seayouagain_04_49,"Cradling it in her arms, she closes her eyes contentedly."

d_ex_seayouagain_05_7,"I thought this would be a piece of cake,"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_8,but it's tough keeping your balance.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_9,Anis has been attempting to surf for the past few hours.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_10,"Despite the relatively low water level, she has not been having much luck."
d_ex_seayouagain_05_11,This is why nothing beats a good inner tube.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_12,"It's nice and safe, and it doubles as a fashion accessory."
d_ex_seayouagain_05_13,Weren't you going on about how you wanted to try out the surfboard before?
d_ex_seayouagain_05_14,"Yeah, but I don't wanna get soaked,"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_15,so the inner tube will do me just fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_16,Just you watch.

d_ex_seayouagain_05_28,We aren't the Aegis squad.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_29,Continual exposure to seawater isn't good for us.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_30,...
d_ex_seayouagain_05_31,Right!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_32,What if it has an adverse effect on your body? Then what?
d_ex_seayouagain_05_33,"If Mary finds out about this, she'll chase you down with a hypodermic needle for sure."
d_ex_seayouagain_05_34,A big one.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_35,Which is good for your health.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_36,"Apparently, everyone interpreted my suggestion to Anis differently."
d_ex_seayouagain_05_37,... Neon.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_38,Mary doesn't go out giving inoculations willy-nilly.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_39,"I get what you're all trying to say,"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_40,but I think I'm getting the hang of this.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_41,I'll be able to stand up and hold my balance any minute now.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_42,Can I keep going for just a little longer?
d_ex_seayouagain_05_43,"I won't push myself too far,"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_44,I promise!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_45,Pretty please?
d_ex_seayouagain_05_46,Commanderrrr!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_47,... Fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_48,A while later.
d_ex_seayouagain_05_49,"*Splash, swoooshhhh*"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_50,A-Anis! Your swimsuit!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_51,What about it?
d_ex_seayouagain_05_52,!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_53,Gahhh!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_54,"Commander, don't look!"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_55,"Commander,"
d_ex_seayouagain_05_56,please close your eyes for a moment!
d_ex_seayouagain_05_57,I knew this would happen.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_title,Juice: The Mighty Elixir
d_ex_seayouagain_06_1,Mmm? What's going on here?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_2,"It was raining cats and dogs earlier,"
d_ex_seayouagain_06_3,and now the sun's come right back out.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_4,It feels like we imagined that storm that just blew through.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_5,"I know, right?"
d_ex_seayouagain_06_6,Maybe island weather is fickler.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_7,Holy moly!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_8,It's freezing out here!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_9,Would you look at that? Isn't it sweet?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_10,What a lovely summer scene.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_11,Rapi! Anis!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_12,There is a buncha pretty seashells over here.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_13,"Whoa, you're right!"
d_ex_seayouagain_06_14,This one's even rainbow-colored.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_15,I've never seen that before.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_16,There's no way that can be rainbow color...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_17,!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_18,Fascinating.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_19,Totally fascinating.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_20,Must be some kind of mutation.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_21,Would you get a look at that?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_22,"Ah, to be young again."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_23,...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_24,*Sigh*
d_ex_seayouagain_06_25,"Helm sits alone on the beach, staring into space."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_26,What's going on with her?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_27,"The storm could come back any minute, and she's wasting this precious time zoning out."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_28,"Rookie, are you just going to stand there watching her?"
d_ex_seayouagain_06_29,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_30,She's got her own personal storm cloud following her.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_31,Go and help her chase it away. I'll give you a discount if you do.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_32,Yan hands me a glass full of reddish liquid.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_33,This is some leftover watermelon juice from today.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_34,A sip of something sweet is sure to cheer her up.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_35,Thanks for caring.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_36,Don't sweat it.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_37,It bums me out seeing her down on herself like that. Now hurry and go cheer her up.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_38,I walk towards Helm with the drink Yan gave me.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_39,Subordinate? What's going on?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_40,I have a gift for you.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_41,What is it?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_42,"Here, have some of this juice. It's bound to put a smile on your face."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_43,Oh...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_44,...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_45,Thanks.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_46,*Gulp gulp*
d_ex_seayouagain_06_47,"Helm downs the entire glass, not leaving a single drop behind."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_48,It's very sweet. Delicious.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_49,What kind of drink...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_50,Wait a minute...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_51,?!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_52,Helm? You okay?
d_ex_seayouagain_06_53,I'm definitely feeling something...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_54,What the...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_55,Helm's face turns beet red.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_56,Perhaps that wasn't watermelon juice that Yan gave me...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_57,I know what you're doing.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_58,I'm not dumb.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_59,"When men give women this, I know what they're after."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_60,I know it all... too well.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_61,You... Like... Meeee...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_62,He... Heheh...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_63,Helm stumbles towards me.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_64,Subordina...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_65,*Slump*
d_ex_seayouagain_06_66,Helm?!
d_ex_seayouagain_06_67,She then slumps over onto the ground.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_68,"Whoops, my bad."
d_ex_seayouagain_06_69,Guess I put something else in that glass.
d_ex_seayouagain_06_70,...
d_ex_seayouagain_06_71,Not that it matters anyway. So long as it made her feel good.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_title,Unwavering Comfort
d_ex_seayouagain_07_1,"As the storm approaches, the Nikkes on the beach are visibly disappointed."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_2,"Volt, we should head back inside."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_3,*Whine*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_4,"Great, I'm not gonna sell any drinks in this kind of weather."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_5,Just my luck.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_6,Everyone begins to head inside the log cabin.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_7,"Anis, Neon."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_8,We should go inside too.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_9,This is so unfair!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_10,I can't go in because it's so unfair!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_11,"We just started having fun, and now a storm's brewing?"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_12,I refuse! I'm staying out here.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_13,"The wind is awfully strong, though."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_14,"If we could withstand the wind, then..."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_15,"I'd have mastery over fire, water, and even wind!"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_16,My powers would be limitless!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_17,I would truly be a force to be reckoned with!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_18,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_19,Several of the Nikkes want to remain on the beach.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_20,What could you possibly do in this weather?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_21,"Surfing, maybe?"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_22,*Splasssh! Swoooosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_23,"The water, kicked up by the storm, has caused intense waves to crash against the shore."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_24,"Yikes. If we take a tumble against one of those waves, we could be swept out to sea."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_25,I guess that rules that out.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_26,How about a squirt gunfight?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_27,*Tudududududu*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_28,"The rain becomes a torrential downpour, pelting the four of us."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_29,Ow!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_30,I think squirt guns may be unnecessary.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_31,"Okay, fine. How about this?"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_32,"Whoever can endure the storm longest, wins!"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_33,What?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_34,Anis plops down on the ground.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_35,So we're training to become one with the storm?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_36,Maybe then we could have power over the elements!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_37,Hyah!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_38,Neon lays down beside Anis in the same position.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_39,You two are something else.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_40,The wind isn't even that bad yet. Going inside now would be super lame.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_41,Let's stay outside and enjoy it a little more.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_42,"When else are we gonna have a chance to enjoy nature, or this version of it, at least?"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_43,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_44,Very well.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_45,Rapi sits upright beside Neon and Anis.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_46,Soon after.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_47,*Splat*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_48,Agh! What is this?!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_49,A plastic bag carried by the wind smacks Anis in the face.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_50,... Ha.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_51,Hahaha!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_52,"You should see your face, Anis! So funny!"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_53,Don't just stand there laughing! Help me get this thing off!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_54,Rapi helps take the bag off Anis' face.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_55,"Hey, look at that."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_56,Isn't that a handkerchief flying past?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_57,That's no handkerchief. That's the swimsuit Pepper was wearing.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_58,Watch out!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_59,*Whip* *Boom*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_60,What was that that just flew past?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_61,I think it may have been the clinic's sign.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_62,We'll have to tell Liter to fix that.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_63,Ugh! All this wind is kicking up too much sand.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_64,My eyes sting...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_65,Not to mention all the flying debris.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_66,I think we've 'enjoyed' enough nature for the time being. How about we head inside?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_67,I will if Neon agrees to it.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_68,I'll go if you go.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_69,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_70,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_71,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_72,Let's count to three and all go in together.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_73,Fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_74,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_75,One...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_76,Two...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_77,Three.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_78,The only person that gets up is Rapi.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_79,Hey! I thought we all promised we'd go in together.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_80,You didn't stand up either!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_81,*Sigh*
d_ex_seayouagain_07_82,"One, two, three."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_83,"After her second countdown, Rapi lifts her two fellow Nikkes off the ground."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_84,"Let's head inside, for real this time."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_85,"I don't want to hear any crying about it, either."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_86,"Argh, this sand is so annoying!"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_87,"I'll be sure to bring sturdier glasses next time, ones that'll block out all the flying sand."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_88,As we all head back to the log cabin...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_89,Zzzzz...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_90,we discover Frima sleeping peacefully amidst the raging storm.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_91,"Jeez, it's practically the end times out here, and she's out like a light."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_92,"Her hammock is steady as a rock, too."
d_ex_seayouagain_07_93,How is that even possible?
d_ex_seayouagain_07_94,That's it!
d_ex_seayouagain_07_95,She must have already mastered the art of wind power.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_96,I'll have to ask her for her secret next time.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_97,...
d_ex_seayouagain_07_98,Let's hurry inside.
d_ex_seayouagain_07_99,"In the end, Frima was the one who endured the storm the longest,"
d_ex_seayouagain_07_100,making her the winner.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_title,A Spooky Summer
d_ex_seayouagain_08_1,Scary stories and summertime go together like peanut butter and jelly.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_2,"As the thick fog unfurls across the ominous lake, a woman with long, black hair"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_3,slowly emerges from the depths.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_4,...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_5,"Standing far off on the shore, you see her gesture with her hand, beckoning you to come closer."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_6,...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_7,I can't go alone... I won't!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_8,Nooooo!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_9,Gah!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_10,"Liter, your screaming is freaking me out more than the story!"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_11,The spooky stories Yan is regaling us with have us all on edge.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_12,"All right, everyone, that was my final story."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_13,"Since we're on vacation and all, I'll give you a discount. Only 1,000 credits per person."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_14,"What? 1,000 credits?!"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_15,I didn't know we had to pay to listen?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_16,You should have known better.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_17,"In this world, nothing comes free."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_18,"Suddenly, another terrifying emotion comes over the room: greed."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_19,Did you have fun?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_20,How could I have?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_21,We got taken for a ride with that stupid collection of scary stories.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_22,Getting ripped off on vacation is a common occurrence.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_23,I guess you could say it was our own personal horror story.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_24,Do you think Rapi knew this was going to happen?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_25,That's not fair! She should have told us!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_26,That'd explain why she was so adamant about not coming.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_27,Something fishy is going on here.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_28,"Yeah, you're right."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_29,Let's find her and get some answers.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_30,She wasn't in her room.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_31,Maybe she's at the beach.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_32,Let's go find her!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_33,All of us search for Rapi.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_34,"Anis, don't you feel like the fog is getting thicker around us?"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_35,Huh? You're right. What's going on?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_36,What's that over there?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_37,"Off in the distance, standing near the shoreline, we can make out an indistinct figure."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_38,Rapi?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_39,"It's hard to make the silhouette clear because of the fog, but it appears to be Rapi."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_40,Rapi!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_41,There's no response.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_42,*Sigh* She must be working again.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_43,I don't get it. Why bother with vacation when all you're gonna do is work?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_44,Let's go say something to her.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_45,Maybe something else is going on.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_46,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_47,Like what?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_48,She might be doing some solo training.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_49,What kind of training?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_50,To become a master of the elements.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_51,What in the world are you on about?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_52,"Rapi might want to commandeer the wind, or she could be trying to accomplish some other ambitious goal like that."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_53,"Sorry, but you're the only one interested in pursuing such unintelligible fantasies."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_54,Hey! Don't call them fantasies! You're so mean...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_55,"As Anis and Neon bicker back and forth,"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_56,the miasma of fog around us continues to become more concentrated.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_57,"All the while, the distant figure that may or may not be Rapi gestures for us to come closer."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_58,Let's head over to her.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_59,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_60,We can ask her ourselves
d_ex_seayouagain_08_61,and see if I'm right or Anis is right.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_62,Fine by me. Let's go.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_63,Rapi!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_64,Rapi!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_65,"As we approach Rapi,"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_66,"the fog seems to dissipate, giving us a clearer view of her."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_67,How come she's standing in the water?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_68,And why is her hair all wet?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_69,Rapi seems different from her usual self.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_70,"First, there's the fact that she hasn't been responding to us,"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_71,and now she's rising ominously from the water...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_72,Commander?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_73,?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_74,Rapi's familiar voice can be heard behind us.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_75,"Wait, is that..."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_76,Rapi?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_77,All of us turn in unison and look back.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_78,Rapi is standing not far from us.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_79,Are there... two Rapis?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_80,Just come a little closer.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_81,I can't go alone...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_82,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_83,Wh-who said that?!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_84,"As we turn back to face the water, there is no one there."
d_ex_seayouagain_08_85,All of us freeze.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_86,...?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_87,What's going on with all of you?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_88,Rapi comes closer to us.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_89,Are... you the real Rapi?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_90,What kind of question is that?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_91,Of course I'm Rapi.
d_ex_seayouagain_08_92,Who else would I be?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_93,Then what about the Rapi out in the water?
d_ex_seayouagain_08_94,"Yeah, the one who keeps beckoning us to come closer?"
d_ex_seayouagain_08_95,...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_96,...
d_ex_seayouagain_08_97,Gaaahhhhh!
d_ex_seayouagain_08_98,"Anis, Neon, and I all frantically sprint back to the cabin."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_title,Fish Dish Challenge
d_ex_seayouagain_09_1,Liter stares at the bucket full of fish before her.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_2,Who caught all these fish?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_3,Is someone planning on starting up an aquarium?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_4,We went fishing earlier today.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_5,"At first, we just caught one or two, then it started adding up."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_6,"That reminds me,"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_7,should we cook these fishies up?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_8,"When you say 'we', who do you mean?"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_9,"You, Liter, and me, of course!"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_10,Are you sure that's a good idea?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_11,I'm a far cry from a chef.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_12,I'm not exactly well-versed in cooking either.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_13,"But it's okay, we've got Liter."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_14,We can be her sous chefs.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_15,"Wait a minute, why are you roping me into this?"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_16,Because you've got the magic touch. You can make anything.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_17,I can only assume that'd extend to cooking as well.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_18,Or are you not confident in your cooking skills?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_19,...
d_ex_seayouagain_09_20,"Oh boy, I'm sorry."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_21,I hadn't even thought you being bad at cooking was a feasible option.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_22,I'll stop bringing it up.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_23,Would you just be quiet? Quit rushing to conclusions.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_24,I haven't even said anything yet.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_25,Oh... so does that mean you can do it?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_26,How hard can cooking be?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_27,I'll lend a hand.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_28,"I could be imagining things, but I sense nervous energy coming from Liter."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_29,Awesome! Thanks.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_30,What kind of dish should we make?
d_ex_seayouagain_09_31,"To my left, I've got Neon, who could burn water. On my right, there's Liter, who's a nervous wreck."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_32,Something tells me I should be the one to take the lead on this culinary venture.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_33,I think grilled fish would be good.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_34,I think fish stew would be good.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_35,"My thinking exactly, Greenhorn."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_36,Grilled over a high flame.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_37,Sounds like something that calls for firepower!
d_ex_seayouagain_09_38,Then I'm just the woman for the job!
d_ex_seayouagain_09_39,I remind Neon to adjust the flame before the grilled fish becomes charcoal.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_40,"A solid recommendation, Greenhorn."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_41,We'll have to boil the stew over a high flame.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_42,"That way, all the ingredients will get nice and soft."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_43,I knew you'd be an expert at this.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_44,"As for me, I'll supply the firepower!"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_45,I turn down the flame before the fish stew becomes a bowl of charcoal.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_46,"To my pleasant surprise, the cooking process has gone relatively smoothly."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_47,The smell is intoxicating.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_48,And it looks delicious too.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_49,It's a good thing you've got two capable sous chefs.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_50,"And with me as the head chef, we'll have ourselves a delectable meal in no time."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_51,Liter's previous nervousness seems to have melted away entirely.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_52,"Chef, may I do the final touches?"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_53,Of course.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_54,"You've done well up until this point, so I'll leave the finishing touches to you."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_55,A teaspoon of salt.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_56,"A teaspoon of pepper,"
d_ex_seayouagain_09_57,and to finish it off...
d_ex_seayouagain_09_58,A pinch of the special seasoning we brought from the Ark.
d_ex_seayouagain_09_59,*Plop*
d_ex_seayouagain_09_60,"As I turn the bottle of seasoning over, the top pops off, and the entire bottle spills into the pot."
d_ex_seayouagain_09_61,...
d_ex_seayouagain_09_62,...
d_ex_seayouagain_09_63,...
d_ex_seayouagain_09_64,"With one fell swoop, our first dish has become a spectacular failure."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_title,Sand Sculpture Guessing Game
d_ex_seayouagain_10_1,What's everyone doing here?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_2,"Mast, Helm, and Anchor are hard at work attempting to make something in the sand."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_3,"Oh, hey Captain."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_4,It's good that you showed up.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_5,"We're not quite finished with it yet, but can you guess what it is?"
d_ex_seayouagain_10_6,Mast stands before a sharp and pointy object.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_7,Is it...
d_ex_seayouagain_10_8,"a castle spire... or sand castle spire, rather?"
d_ex_seayouagain_10_9,Morgan? It kinda looks like his beak.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_10,"Sorry, but not quite right."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_11,What you're looking at is a sail.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_12,"I'm making a pirate ship, which I've always wanted to sail on."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_13,That's supposed to be a ship?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_14,Yep!
d_ex_seayouagain_10_15,You could say it's my dream ship.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_16,You should come back to see it when I'm done.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_17,That's one strike out for me.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_18,"I approach Helm, who is also frenetically piling up sand."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_19,"Subordinate,"
d_ex_seayouagain_10_20,could you pass me that shell over there?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_21,I toss the shell towards Helm.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_22,Helm places the shell atop her creation and gives a contented smile.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_23,Are you done?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_24,Correct.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_25,You should be able to tell what this is.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_26,Despite Helm's apparent confidence... it's difficult to ascertain exactly what she's created.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_27,"Knowing Helm though, there's only one thing she could possibly have made."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_28,Is it the Admire?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_29,... No.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_30,"It's the foul creature that we all defeated, the Kraken."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_31,I'll try to make some improvements next time.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_32,Seeing the evident disappointment on Helm's face saddens me as well.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_33,I really need to guess it correctly next time.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_34,I move onto Anchor.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_35,"Hey, Captain. Are you here to join us?"
d_ex_seayouagain_10_36,"Ah, first, let me tell you what I made."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_37,"Wait, let me guess."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_38,"Okay, sure."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_39,Anchor is placing large oval-shaped shells around her large sand sculpture.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_40,Could you give me a hint?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_41,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_10_42,It's something that I like.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_43,"In that case, I know exactly what it is."
d_ex_seayouagain_10_44,I've got this one in the bag.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_45,It's a sea squirt.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_46,It's a sea cucumber.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_47,Indeed.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_48,Finally!
d_ex_seayouagain_10_49,Not.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_50,...
d_ex_seayouagain_10_51,Then what is it?
d_ex_seayouagain_10_52,It's a castle where all the starfish live.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_53,... Uh-huh.
d_ex_seayouagain_10_54,"Having failed to guess a single sand sculpture correctly,"
d_ex_seayouagain_10_55,I resign myself to helping Anchor finish her dwelling place for starfish made of sand.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_title,Fish Dish Challenge: Part Deux
d_ex_seayouagain_11_1,"On the ground, there is a bucket full of fish."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_2,What's with the fish?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_3,I thought you'd brought them.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_4,Do you want to cook with them again?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_5,As if I'd do that!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_6,"Oooh, I'm glad I came. I heard about there being lots of fish here."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_7,"Word on the street is that you're quite the chef, Liter."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_8,Wh-what?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_9,Who's spreading such bald-faced lies?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_10,Neon.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_11,She told us you're a master when it comes to cooking with fish.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_12,So we wanted to get a taste ourselves.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_13,So Neon must have caught all these.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_14,"That's right... because we asked her to, hehe."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_15,"If you're in need of a few sous chefs, look no further."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_16,Mary and I will help you.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_17,"Seems like you'll get to show off your skills once again, Chef."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_18,Ugh...
d_ex_seayouagain_11_19,Fine. Let's try it.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_20,"I don't need your help though,"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_21,Greenhorn.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_22,I don't want you dumping an entire bottle of seasoning and ruining the dish like last time.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_23,You can just stay back and watch.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_24,Are we actually going to be able to make it through today without any problems?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_25,"Maintaining enough distance between me and the others so that Liter doesn't berate me, I sit back and watch."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_26,Today's menu consists of:
d_ex_seayouagain_11_27,Are those grilled fish skewers?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_28,Is that Mediterranean fish stew?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_29,"The key to quality grilling is a nice, strong flame."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_30,Crank the heat up to the max and grill away!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_31,Gotcha!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_32,Let's do it!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_33,I'm worried that we're going to end up eating charcoal briquets instead of fish skewers.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_34,Just as I'm about to give up all hope...
d_ex_seayouagain_11_35,"Pepper, wait a moment."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_36,"To my amazement, Mary turns the flame down to the appropriate level."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_37,That should be enough.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_38,So you just dice up all the ingredients and toss them in?
d_ex_seayouagain_11_39,Sounds easy enough.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_40,"The key to making a nice, hearty stew is a strong flame."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_41,Keep on boiling everything until those ingredients get to know each other.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_42,Gotcha!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_43,Leave it to me!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_44,"At this rate, they're going to boil the ingredients into mush."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_45,Just as I'm about to give up all hope...
d_ex_seayouagain_11_46,"Pepper, wait a moment."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_47,"As if reading my mind, Mary turns the flame down to the appropriate level."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_48,That should be enough.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_49,"Thanks to Mary coming in clutch, the dish is going well."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_50,All that remains are the finishing touches.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_51,"It looks like Neon was telling us the truth about you, Liter."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_52,It already looks and smells delectable.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_53,You're really good at cooking.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_54,"Haha, that's right."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_55,"If I'd known you were so good at this, I'd have come by sooner."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_56,"The day is still young,"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_57,and we've got plenty of fish left over.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_58,We can still put them to good use.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_59,Sounds good!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_60,"As for the dish, I think all it needs is some seasoning."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_61,"Would you like to do the honors, Commander?"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_62,"Liter eyeballs me with no small amount of distrust, but eventually gives in and nods reluctantly."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_63,I can't imagine you'd make the same mistake twice.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_64,"You must have been bored sitting there watching us, so go ahead."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_65,One teaspoon of salt.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_66,One teaspoon of pepper.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_67,And lastly...
d_ex_seayouagain_11_68,A pinch of the special seasoning from the Ark.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_69,*Slip*
d_ex_seayouagain_11_70,Not again!
d_ex_seayouagain_11_71,*Grab*
d_ex_seayouagain_11_72,"Fortunately for you,"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_73,"I'm pretty good at catching things, Commander."
d_ex_seayouagain_11_74,*Shhkk ssshkk*
d_ex_seayouagain_11_75,Mary lightly sprinkles in some of the seasoning.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_76,Thanks.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_77,No problem.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_78,Soon after.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_79,We all gather around and taste the fish dish.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_80,It tastes...
d_ex_seayouagain_11_81,Scrumptious.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_82,Mhmm! Super delicious.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_83,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_84,Tastes just like
d_ex_seayouagain_11_85,how mom makes it.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_86,"I always thought that was a weird expression,"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_87,"but I actually think it's appropriate in this instance,"
d_ex_seayouagain_11_88,since it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
d_ex_seayouagain_11_89,"Thankfully, our second attempt at cooking was a smashing success."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_title,Swimsuits and Training Sessions
d_ex_seayouagain_12_1,Mast.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_2,Anchor.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_3,"We may be on vacation, but that doesn't mean we can neglect our training entirely."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_4,"Even if it's just for a little while, let's train together."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_5,"I told you,"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_6,"didn't I, Anchor?"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_7,Pay up. 100 credits.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_8,"Dang it. Fine, here."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_9,What are you two doing?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_10,We made a bet as to
d_ex_seayouagain_12_11,whether you'd bring up training during vacation.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_12,"I went with my gut feeling, which is never wrong!"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_13,I knew it'd be impossible for you not to mention anything about training.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_14,You'd go insane in the membrane if you didn't bring up training at least once during the day.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_15,"If she had a membrane, that'd make her a lot like a squid."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_16,...
d_ex_seayouagain_12_17,...
d_ex_seayouagain_12_18,"Aaaanyways,"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_19,"I knew you'd bring up something like this, Helm,"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_20,so I've been preparing.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_21,I was hoping that
d_ex_seayouagain_12_22,"you wouldn't bring it up,"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_23,but I expected you might.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_24,...
d_ex_seayouagain_12_25,"So, I take it this means you both are ready to train?"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_26,"Make any additional preparations you need, and meet back here in a few minutes."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_27,"Aye aye, Sir!"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_28,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_29,A moment later.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_30,"Mast, reporting for duty."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_31,"I'm here, too."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_32,"All right, that's everyone."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_33,Shall we begin?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_34,Just a minute.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_35,What is it?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_36,Didn't we gather to train?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_37,Correct.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_38,Then how come you're all in swimsuits?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_39,!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_40,And...
d_ex_seayouagain_12_41,I'm the only one in the squad
d_ex_seayouagain_12_42,who doesn't have a swimsuit.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_43,!!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_44,You two did this on purpose!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_45,Anchor produces a certain sea creature out of her pocket.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_46,W-wait.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_47,It's not what you think.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_48,Ju-just put the starfish down.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_49,"Yeah, what she said!"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_50,This is all just a big misunderstanding!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_51,Hmph.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_52,You two go have fun in your swimsuits.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_53,"With that, Anchor reels back and hurls the several starfish in her hand toward Helm and Mast."
d_ex_seayouagain_12_54,*Splat* *Splat*
d_ex_seayouagain_12_55,Eek!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_56,Argh!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_57,May you live long and prosper in those stupid swimsuits of yours.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_58,Anchor turns and leaves without so much as a glance back.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_59,M-Mast...!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_60,C-can you take this off for me?
d_ex_seayouagain_12_61,"Sorry,"
d_ex_seayouagain_12_62,but I can't see anything either.
d_ex_seayouagain_12_63,!!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_64,!!!
d_ex_seayouagain_12_65,"Mast and Helm, blinded by the starfish on their faces, struggle for a while to remove them."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_title,Overworked Companion
d_ex_seayouagain_13_1,*Knock knock*
d_ex_seayouagain_13_2,*Creaaaak*
d_ex_seayouagain_13_3,Helm?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_4,Sorry to bother you so late.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_5,It's okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_6,Is there something wrong?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_7,"You didn't go swimming, did you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_8,"No, it's not that."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_9,I just have a headache.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_10,Let's take a look.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_11,Mary gives Helm a cursory examination.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_12,It looks to me like you're overworked.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_13,Have you been working this entire time?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_14,... Yes.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_15,"If overwork is what's causing it, then it's not a major issue."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_16,Thanks for seeing me.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_17,*Grab*
d_ex_seayouagain_13_18,"As Helm turns to leave the clinic, Mary clasps onto her arm."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_19,"Just a moment, Helm."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_20,?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_21,Let's go for a walk together.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_22,*Splash* *Swoosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_13_23,Isn't this nice?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_24,There's something special about the sea at night.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_25,...
d_ex_seayouagain_13_26,That it is.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_27,"... You brought me out here because you were worried I'd continue working, didn't you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_28,"You're a doctor, all right."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_29,Thank you for your concern.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_30,It's not that at all.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_31,"When I saw you, it was like I was looking into a mirror."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_32,"So, I thought I would go out for a little breather, and figured I'd ask you to come along."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_33,"If it weren't for small breaks like this, I'd be overworked too."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_34,So you're a fanatic about work as well?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_35,"Pepper was pestering me the other day,"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_36,urging me not to work so hard.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_37,"She says that, but she herself hasn't had a single day's rest since we got here."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_38,"I think that may have something to do with me, though."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_39,"Even just now, at this hour of the night, I was still here at the clinic."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_40,Perhaps a resident physician who sees the attending physician working so hard feels they have to do the same.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_41,I can certainly imagine
d_ex_seayouagain_13_42,"that being the case,"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_43,"but as a leader, there's only so much you can do."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_44,You have so many other responsibilities to focus on.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_45,"For me, protecting my squad is what I care about most."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_46,That's what I place the most focus on.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_47,I feel the same way.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_48,I guess there are some problems we just can't solve.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_49,*Splash* *Swoosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_13_50,How's your headache?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_51,Gone now.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_52,I think this little stroll had a positive effect.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_53,I'm glad to hear that!
d_ex_seayouagain_13_54,We should head back.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_55,"Yes, we still have lots to do."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_56,"While heading back, Mary stops and utters portentously:"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_57,Can you promise me one thing?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_58,What is it?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_59,"It's okay to push yourself,"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_60,"but going forward, come and see me whenever you're feeling unwell or out of sorts."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_61,"That's not too hard, is it?"
d_ex_seayouagain_13_62,Fine. I'll do that.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_63,"Come on then, pinky promise."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_64,Do I have to?
d_ex_seayouagain_13_65,I'm afraid so.
d_ex_seayouagain_13_66,"Words only mean so much, but a pinky promise makes it official."
d_ex_seayouagain_13_67,"Helm hesitantly proffers her pinky, causing Mary to smile brightly."
d_ex_armory_06_title,Underwater Gun
d_ex_armory_06_1,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_06_2,Hmm?
d_ex_armory_06_3,Subordinate? What are you and Neon doing here?
d_ex_armory_06_4,Hehehe...
d_ex_armory_06_5,"You may not have known this,"
d_ex_armory_06_6,but I'm gaga about the armory.
d_ex_armory_06_7,This place is filled with the scent of gunpowder.
d_ex_armory_06_8,"But whenever I try and hang out here, I always end up getting kicked out."
d_ex_armory_06_9,"They're doing a shift change now, and there's no guard, so I decided now was a perfect time for a little visit."
d_ex_armory_06_10,You mean sneak in?
d_ex_armory_06_11,"Sure, whatever. Same thing."
d_ex_armory_06_12,"Anyway, in case you didn't know,"
d_ex_armory_06_13,I'm a spy!
d_ex_armory_06_14,"I was coming over, and let her tag along since she was so excited to come."
d_ex_armory_06_15,... Or that.
d_ex_armory_06_16,I see.
d_ex_armory_06_17,How come you're at the armory? And why are you wearing a swimsuit?
d_ex_armory_06_18,Ah...
d_ex_armory_06_19,"As we've seen for ourselves,"
d_ex_armory_06_20,anything can happen when you're out at sea.
d_ex_armory_06_21,"I want to be prepared for next time,"
d_ex_armory_06_22,"and a normal gun wouldn't have any effect in the water,"
d_ex_armory_06_23,so I came to see if there are any special weapons that function underwater.
d_ex_armory_06_24,What's that got to do with you being in a swimsuit?
d_ex_armory_06_25,"Oh, er... I thought it might be useful when checking the different firearms."
d_ex_armory_06_26,How do you mean?
d_ex_armory_06_27,"You know, like if it gels with the materials, stuff like that..."
d_ex_armory_06_28,Just be honest and say that you wanted a gun that goes well with a swimsuit.
d_ex_armory_06_29,...
d_ex_armory_06_30,"If you want a gun that works underwater,"
d_ex_armory_06_31,why not just use a squirt gun?
d_ex_armory_06_32,I can't have a gun that uses water as ammunition.
d_ex_armory_06_33,Why not?
d_ex_armory_06_34,Are you looking down on waterpower?!
d_ex_armory_06_35,"If the stream is strong enough, water can pack a real wallop."
d_ex_armory_06_36,"That may be true,"
d_ex_armory_06_37,"but if you're submerged, waterpower becomes ineffectual because of the water resistance."
d_ex_armory_06_38,Hmmm...
d_ex_armory_06_39,"The gears seem to be spinning in Neon's head. After a while, she points at an unusual-looking firearm hanging on the wall."
d_ex_armory_06_40,How about this one?
d_ex_armory_06_41,"It's a speargun, so you could shoot it super far in the water."
d_ex_armory_06_42,"It would certainly be less susceptible to water resistance, so that's a plus."
d_ex_armory_06_43,"But it takes far too long to reload,"
d_ex_armory_06_44,and it'd only take longer when you're underwater.
d_ex_armory_06_45,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_06_46,This is a toughie.
d_ex_armory_06_47,I never thought about having a gun that fires underwater.
d_ex_armory_06_48,I can't believe I made such a major oversight.
d_ex_armory_06_49,You'll need bullets that have the least resistance to water.
d_ex_armory_06_50,"Exactly,"
d_ex_armory_06_51,but they'd have to be heavy in order to travel any decent distance.
d_ex_armory_06_52,"So they need to be thin, sharp, and heavy."
d_ex_armory_06_53,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_06_54,Based on my knowledge of firepo...
d_ex_armory_06_55,"I mean waterpower,"
d_ex_armory_06_56,I don't think there are any weapons here that meet that criteria.
d_ex_armory_06_57,The closest thing would probably be...
d_ex_armory_06_58,this one.
d_ex_armory_06_59,What is it?
d_ex_armory_06_60,"I'm not entirely sure what its original intended purpose was,"
d_ex_armory_06_61,but the bullets are very thin and long.
d_ex_armory_06_62,"The tips are round, though."
d_ex_armory_06_63,Wow...
d_ex_armory_06_64,"It's a bit heavier than I thought it'd be, but I think this could work."
d_ex_armory_06_65,I didn't know a gun like this would be in the armory.
d_ex_armory_06_66,"Thank you,"
d_ex_armory_06_67,Neon.
d_ex_armory_06_68,No problem!
d_ex_armory_06_69,"With my waterpower behind me, this is a walk in the park!"
d_ex_armory_06_70,Did you need anything else?
d_ex_armory_06_71,Let me show you the accessories that would go great with this gun.
d_ex_armory_06_72,"Neon, Eunhwa will be here any second."
d_ex_armory_06_73,"Oh shoot, you're right."
d_ex_armory_06_74,The accessories will have to wait until next time.
d_ex_armory_06_75,I better skedaddle!
d_ex_armory_06_76,Neon hurriedly rushes out of the armory.
d_ex_armory_06_77,...
d_ex_armory_06_78,She can really move when she wants to.
d_ex_armory_06_79,Can this gun actually be fired underwater?
d_ex_armory_06_80,No.
d_ex_armory_06_81,The bullets are too light.
d_ex_armory_06_82,They wouldn't be able to counteract the water resistance.
d_ex_armory_06_83,But why did you tell Neon that it could work?
d_ex_armory_06_84,I appreciated how she was willing to show me so many different firearms.
d_ex_armory_06_85,"Also, compared to the other, this is the closest to what I'm looking for."
d_ex_armory_06_86,This will make a good starting point when I file a request for a customized weapon.
d_ex_armory_06_87,"So in the end, it did help."
d_ex_armory_06_88,It did.
d_ex_armory_06_89,"You said Eunhwa will be here soon, right?"
d_ex_armory_06_90,I can talk to her about this gun.
d_ex_armory_06_91,I hope your customized weapon comes out like you want it.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_title,Vitamin Drink
d_ex_seayouagain_14_1,The sun is beating down.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_2,It is sweltering outside.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_3,It feels like the weather itself has gone haywire.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_4,Just the act of breathing is enough to send beads of sweat pouring down.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_5,"Are you feeling a bit warm, Commander?"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_6,"It is summer after all, so it's natural to feel hot."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_7,"Sure, but not when it's to the point that you start to feel light-headed."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_8,Pepper's right.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_9,You don't look so hot... pardon the choice of words.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_10,Go inside and rest.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_11,How about I take you to the clinic and get you a nice IV booster?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_12,I don't like the sound of an IV.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_13,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_14_14,"You're not the only one, either."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_15,"Lots of people have been suffering from heatstroke, but no one has been coming to the clinic."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_16,Is there any good method?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_17,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_14_18,"Isn't there anything non-invasive you can give them,"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_19,"like a vitamin drink, or some medicine?"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_20,"We don't have anything on hand, but I'm sure I can whip something up."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_21,"A shot is the most effective option, though..."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_22,"No way, no how."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_23,You have to banish that option from your mind right now.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_24,I've often encountered the same thing in business.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_25,"You want to sell the best products for the highest price,"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_26,but the customer isn't always cooperative.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_27,"Some people would rather pay less for a product that may not be top-of-the-line, but simply gets the job done."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_28,"I know it may not be as effective as an injection,"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_29,but you've gotta come up with an alternative medicine that can be easily consumed and doesn't hurt.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_30,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_14_31,Ah!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_32,I've got just the ticket!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_33,Pepper dashes into the clinic.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_34,Why are you suddenly so interested in helping her out?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_35,What do you mean?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_36,I'm just a helpful gal.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_37,Yan only offers 'helpful' advice when she senses that there's a profit to be made.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_38,You mean something like this?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_39,"Wow, that was fast."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_40,Is this a vitamin drink?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_41,Yep!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_42,Drinking it will help you recover from fatigue and replenish your energy.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_43,Can I try it?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_44,Of course!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_45,*Gulp*
d_ex_seayouagain_14_46,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_14_47,"The taste is a little weird, but it's really refreshing."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_48,That's because it's packed with vitamins and nutrients.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_49,"Fair enough. First things first, you can't be serving this in a paper cup."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_50,"Pour it inside a proper glass,"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_51,"add some ice,"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_52,and top it off with a straw and a clamshell.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_53,Wowee!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_54,It's so pretty!
d_ex_seayouagain_14_55,I'm sure this'll fly off the shelves.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_56,"Oh, I'm sure it will."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_57,"Seeing that I'm not totally unconscionable, how about you take 60% of the profits, and I take 40%?"
d_ex_seayouagain_14_58,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_59,I couldn't do that. I'm going to give this away for free.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_60,"Pepper, listen."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_61,"If you want to drum up interest and potential customers, you've gotta wrap it up in a nice-looking package."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_62,"If you put a reasonable price tag on it, it'll come off as more trustworthy to customers."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_63,You mean trust in me?
d_ex_seayouagain_14_64,People already trust Mary and Pepper plenty.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_65,...
d_ex_seayouagain_14_66,"Okay, fine, I give up."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_67,This industry and mine are clearly night and day.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_68,"Thanks for giving me such great ideas anyway, Yan."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_69,I'll make some more of this and give everyone a cup.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_70,I'll help.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_71,"Oh, no you won't. You just sit here and drink this like a good boy."
d_ex_seayouagain_14_72,Exactly! What she said.
d_ex_seayouagain_14_73,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_title,Truth or Lie
d_ex_seayouagain_15_1,What do you mean you don't believe me?!
d_ex_seayouagain_15_2,"I'm telling you, we saw Rapi out there in the middle of the sea,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_3,"slowly waving her hand, beckoning us to come near."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_4,You can only imagine the fright we had.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_5,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_6,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_7,"I'm sorry,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_8,but I find that hard to believe.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_9,"Seeing strange visions in the sea is a common occurrence, especially if your night vision is subpar."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_10,"Coral reefs, marine life, light sources from the shore... nearly anything can be mistaken for some terrifying apparition."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_11,I'm willing to bet the same thing happened to you all.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_12,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_13,"So it's going to be like that, is it?"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_14,How about you put that oh-so rational brain of yours to work
d_ex_seayouagain_15_15,and come with us to the beach where this mystery Rapi appeared?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_16,... What?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_17,"Since you're so logical, you should be able to figure out what it is we're dealing with."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_18,"Or, at the very least, whether it's just some 'marine life' as you put it."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_19,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_20,Fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_21,"It's best I put these juvenile ghost stories to bed,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_22,otherwise it'll cause unnecessary fear and unrest
d_ex_seayouagain_15_23,amongst those responsible for night patrols.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_24,Um... Helm.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_25,Why do I have to come along?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_26,We need your radar.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_27,You're to scan the waters and see if you detect anything suspicious.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_28,Especially something that could conceivably be mistaken as Rapi.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_29,How about me?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_30,You're the witness.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_31,People might not believe our story if it's just the two of us.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_32,I figured it would be beneficial to have your testimony as well.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_33,I see.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_34,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_35,"It's a fairly eerie night, at any rate."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_36,"I'm not sure about 'eerie',"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_37,but there seems to be a stronger fish smell around than usual.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_38,Maybe a whale got beached.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_39,Perhaps 'Rapi' has already shown herself?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_40,"If a dead whale were on the beach,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_41,there's no doubt the odor would spread for miles.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_42,"I don't see anything like that, though."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_43,Let me turn on my radar.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_44,"... Subordinate,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_45,you are the superior officer on this excursion.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_46,Please don't foment any fear which is unfounded.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_47,"Anchor, activate your radar."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_48,Let's keep our eyes peeled for something that could be causing this smell.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_49,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_50,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_51,... Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_52,I'm picking up something coming from the bungalow.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_53,"Moving, or squirming rather, at a slow speed."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_54,It appears to be moving from house to house in search of something.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_55,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_56,I don't want any wild speculation.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_57,Let's proceed in that direction.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_58,"Soon after, inside the bungalow."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_59,There doesn't seem to be anything here.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_60,"Anchor,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_61,are you sure this is where you caught a signal?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_62,I'm positive.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_63,We must have passed each other at some point.

d_ex_seayouagain_15_71,... I'm not sure.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_72,I'll turn on my radar again.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_73,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_74,What do you see?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_75,Nothing.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_76,At least not within 10m of us.

d_ex_seayouagain_15_84,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_85,That's Rapi's voice.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_86,Could it be the ghost?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_87,Is Rapi messing around with us?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_88,No way. Rapi wouldn't do that.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_89,*Knock knock*

d_ex_seayouagain_15_98,Open the door.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_99,Hold your breath and wait.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_100,...
d_ex_seayouagain_15_101,I think we should open the door.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_102,I don't think that's a good idea.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_103,"No, let's open it."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_104,We came here to conduct an investigation.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_105,"If anything, we should be thankful that whatever this thing is has sought us out."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_106,... I'll open it then.

d_ex_seayouagain_15_114,*Click*
d_ex_seayouagain_15_115,Helm unholsters her weapon
d_ex_seayouagain_15_116,and trains it at the door.

d_ex_seayouagain_15_124,Rapi? Is that really you?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_125,Of course it's me.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_126,Is something wrong?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_127,You all look like you've seen a ghost.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_128,... It's nothing.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_129,"We just heard some strange noises, that's all."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_130,Strange noises?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_131,"Now that I think about it,"
d_ex_seayouagain_15_132,the entire reason I came rushing over here was that
d_ex_seayouagain_15_133,I saw you sprinting through the water towards the floating bungalows.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_134,"But you're dry as a bone right now, and you don't seem the slightest bit out of breath."
d_ex_seayouagain_15_135,What are you talking about?
d_ex_seayouagain_15_136,We've all been inside these bungalows for a while now.
d_ex_seayouagain_15_137,"She's right, we have."

d_ex_seayouagain_16_9,I don't see any snails!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_10,Are you sure you caught them on your radar?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_11,I'm sure of it.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_12,"Even now, it's showing that they're in this area."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_13,Are you sure your radar isn't busted?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_14,*Ding* *Ding*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_15,Anchor smacks herself on the forehead a few times.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_16,"Nope, everything's functioning as it should."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_17,What are you doing still out here?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_18,Captain? The storm is in a rage.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_19,You should get inside.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_20,I was about to say the same thing to you.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_21,"Anchor said there was some kind of special snail here, so we're looking for it."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_22,I know what I saw.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_23,"I was just about to catch it, but then a wave washed it away."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_24,Maybe it got carried out to sea.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_25,Then how come I keep detecting it on my radar?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_26,*Roooar*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_27,*Crashh*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_28,*Swooosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_29,The torrential rain begins to pound down even harder.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_30,How about we call off the search for the time being and head inside?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_31,We can come back to look for it once the storm passes.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_32,Captain is right.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_33,"At this rate, Morgan might get blown away and sent off to sea."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_34,Hmmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_35,Wait. Just let me look at the radar one more time.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_36,It was here... I'm sure of it...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_37,"Anchor closes her eyes, her face adopting a frustrated grimace."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_38,!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_39,It's here!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_40,*Sshhhkkk*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_41,Anchor frantically starts to dig into the sand.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_42,Soon after.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_43,I found it!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_44,We couldn't find it before because it was buried under the sand.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_45,"Check this out, Captain. It's a translucent snail that you can only find up on the surface."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_46,"Cool, looks super rare."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_47,I've never seen snails like this before.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_48,Let's head inside.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_49,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_50,"Thanks for the help, Mast."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_51,No worries.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_52,Now it's time to put this little guy into the box and take him back to the Ark.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_53,You two went out at a time like this? There's a storm raging outside.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_54,Helm!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_55,Look at this.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_56,We found a translucent snail out there.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_57,We got stuck in the rain while we were looking for it.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_58,... I see.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_59,Isn't it adorable?
d_ex_seayouagain_16_60,I can't wait to take this little guy back to the A...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_61,"You do realize that you can't take that back to the Ark, don't you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_16_62,A word of forewarning.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_63,It's illegal to transport any animal or plant life into the Ark.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_64,Huh?!
d_ex_seayouagain_16_65,"When we return, you'll have to leave it here."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_66,But...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_67,"No ifs, ands or buts."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_68,Aw man...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_69,"Don't beat yourself up, Anchor."
d_ex_seayouagain_16_70,These things happen in life.
d_ex_seayouagain_16_71,*Sob*
d_ex_seayouagain_16_72,...
d_ex_seayouagain_16_73,We proceed to play with the translucent snail for the next few hours in an effort to cheer up Anchor.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_title,Nocturnal Luminescence
d_ex_seayouagain_17_1,*Plop*
d_ex_seayouagain_17_2,"It's the middle of the night,"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_3,"and Helm is sitting alone on the beach, tossing pebbles into the ocean."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_4,Why are you here alone?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_5,Subordinate?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_6,I could ask you the same thing.  What are you doing out here so late at night?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_7,I couldn't fall asleep.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_8,I woke up to the sound of rocks being thrown.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_9,I see.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_10,Same with me.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_11,"Oh, sorry..."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_12,I guess it was louder than I thought.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_13,"I couldn't fall asleep, so I came out here for some fresh air."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_14,I feel like sleeping is such a waste.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_15,I want to enjoy the time that we're here for a little longer.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_16,I can understand that.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_17,*Swooosh*
d_ex_seayouagain_17_18,"Ah,"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_19,would you like me to show you something interesting?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_20,Sure.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_21,"Helm lifts herself up,"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_22,and picks up a pebble that's nearby.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_23,"You're not going to throw that at me, are you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_24,Are you going to throw that into the ocean?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_25,...?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_26,I'm going to throw it in the sea.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_27,You guessed it.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_28,Helm tosses the pebble in a graceful arc.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_29,*Plop*
d_ex_seayouagain_17_30,...!!
d_ex_seayouagain_17_31,"The moment the pebble makes contact with the water, waves of blue light emanate outwards."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_32,Wow.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_33,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_34,"Helm gently wades into the ocean,"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_35,causing blue light to shine around her.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_36,These are bioluminescent plankton.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_37,They emit a natural light whenever they bump into each other.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_38,"Whenever the waves become stronger, that light becomes visible to the naked eye."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_39,Isn't it so beautiful?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_40,There are so many precious things you can only see up on the surface.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_41,It breaks my heart that so many people will miss out on this.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_42,This is the first time I've seen something like this. It's stunning.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_43,I'm glad that
d_ex_seayouagain_17_44,I was able to show it to you.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_45,"Until today, I'd only read about this in books."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_46,"I was planning on going to sleep early, 
but after discovering this, I couldn't fall asleep."
d_ex_seayouagain_17_47,I want to show everyone.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_48,So do I.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_49,We can tell everyone about it once they wake up.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_50,Do you think we'll be able to see this again tomorrow night?
d_ex_seayouagain_17_51,Of course.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_52,The sea is on our side.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_53,Good.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_54,"Should we turn in for the night, then?"
d_ex_seayouagain_17_55,Let's.
d_ex_seayouagain_17_56,"I appreciate you staying here with me for a while, Subordinate."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_title,Adverse Aquatherapy
d_ex_seayouagain_18_1,*Achoo*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_2,"Have you got a cold, Captain?"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_3,You're always sick.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_4,It's because of you two.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_5,You two went out during a full-blown storm.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_6,"You're not being fair, Helm."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_7,"Captain was only out there with us for 10 minutes, tops."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_8,There's no way he could have caught a cold that quickly.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_9,"He must have been sick to begin with, so it's not our fault."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_10,Yeah!
d_ex_seayouagain_18_11,*Sigh*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_12,Don't be too harsh on them.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_13,"We found Anchor's snail, so it was worth it."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_14,"I got to spend time with you two, so it was worth it."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_15,...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_16,...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_17,Would you like me to make you some soup?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_18,"If you need anything, just say the word."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_19,...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_20,"At any rate, I'm just glad you don't appear to be overly sick."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_21,"I'll have Mary come over anyway, just to be safe."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_22,"Anchor, Mast. Look after Subordinate until then."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_23,Gotcha.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_24,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_25,Helm leaves the room to fetch Mary.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_26,"Is there anything we can do for you, Captain?"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_27,I think the best thing would be for me to get some sleep.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_28,"Okay then, you do that. I'll wake you up when Mary gets here."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_29,Thanks.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_30,"I close my eyes, feeling comforted that I have Anchor and Mast looking after me."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_31,...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_32,"Anchor, have you ever looked after someone when they were sick?"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_33,Nope. First time.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_34,I saw on a TV show once that being kept cool is really good for you when you're ill.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_35,Do we have anything cold around here?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_36,What about ice?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_37,Too cold.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_38,Should I bring a wet towel?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_39,Too much of a hassle.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_40,"Ah, then what about this? This is colder than you may think."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_41,"Nice! It's the perfect size, as well."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_42,"All right then, here we go."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_43,*Splash*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_44,!
d_ex_seayouagain_18_45,I'm awoken by the sensation of something cold being plastered onto my forehead.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_46,What was that?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_47,"Whatever it is, it feels squishy."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_48,Is this... a sea cucumber?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_49,"How about it, Captain?"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_50,Are you feeling cooler?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_51,"I heard this kinda thing helps when you're under the weather, so I stuck this on your forehead."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_52,You... really shouldn't have troubled yourself.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_53,"Hold it right there, Captain."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_54,"You're not feeling well, so why don't you just lie down?"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_55,"Yeah, we've got to take proper care of you."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_56,Anchor and Mast forcibly make me lie back down on the bed.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_57,I also remember hearing something about how you've got to keep the blood flowing when you're sick.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_58,Any ideas on how we can accomplish that?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_59,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_60,If that's what you're after...
d_ex_seayouagain_18_61,Is that a sea squirt?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_62,"Yep. A sea squirt's shell is pretty lumpy, so..."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_63,*Push*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_64,*Puuush*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_65,You can use it to stimulate blood circulation... interesting.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_66,Hand me one.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_67,Here.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_68,*Push*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_69,*Puuuush*
d_ex_seayouagain_18_70,!
d_ex_seayouagain_18_71,The pain is excruciating.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_72,"Anchor, Mast..."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_73,"For goodness sake,"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_74,"Captain,"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_75,hold still.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_76,We'll take care of everything.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_77,I'm once again forced to lie down on the bed.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_78,I just remembered something.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_79,"I saw a medical documentary recently, and"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_80,it said that bloodletting with something sharp can be beneficial.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_81,Do we have anything that would work for that?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_82,"If you want something sharp,"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_83,you can't go wrong with sea urchins.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_84,!!
d_ex_seayouagain_18_85,"Okay then, take them out!"
d_ex_seayouagain_18_86,Sure.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_87,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_18_88,They're not here.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_89,"Darn, that's too bad."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_90,Thank the heavens.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_91,Not to worry. I've got another box around here somewhere.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_92,That's probably where they are.
d_ex_seayouagain_18_93,!!
d_ex_seayouagain_18_94,"Okay, great. I'll stay with the Captain while you go get them."
d_ex_seayouagain_18_95,I hope that Mary gets here quickly.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_title,?□???
d_ex_seayouagain_19_1,All right.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_2,We need to go over everything that's happened thus far.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_3,Let's start with the first sighting.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_4,"Subordinate, Anis and Neon were strolling along the beach at night."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_5,"There was a thick covering of fog everywhere,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_6,"and off in the distance, you saw Rapi waving at you."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_7,Despite the fact that the real Rapi was right behind us.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_8,*Gulp*
d_ex_seayouagain_19_9,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_10,Let's move onto
d_ex_seayouagain_19_11,the second sighting.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_12,"When Anchor, Subordinate and I were searching inside the bungalow,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_13,someone began knocking at the door.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_14,"The person introduced themselves as Rapi,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_15,"but by the way their raspy voice creaked and cracked,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_16,I'm fairly certain that it was in fact not Rapi.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_17,"Rapi also said that this entity looked like me,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_18,and that she saw me rushing headlong into the ocean.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_19,"Yes, she did."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_20,"So to summarize, this mysterious entity has been imitating Rapi, and perhaps Subordinate as well,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_21,and is attempting to lure us closer to it when night falls.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_22,"For what reason, we have been unable to ascertain."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_23,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_24,I'd like to propose a solution.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_25,"I say we get rid of this thing,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_26,before it has a chance to do us any real harm.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_27,Hmm...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_28,What exactly do you propose?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_29,Let's try spraying it with some salt.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_30,Let's pray.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_31,The sea is already full of salt.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_32,You want to spray it with even more salt?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_33,"Yes, totally saturate it with the stuff."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_34,"... You're not actually being serious, are you?"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_35,Um... no.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_36,Okay. I'll pray to the starfish.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_37,"I'm not a religious person,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_38,so I'm not sure what to pray to.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_39,Me neither.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_40,Then what possessed you to bring it up?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_41,I just saw a film talking about exorcism a few nights ago.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_42,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_43,Here's what I think.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_44,"During the first encounter, it attempted to lure Subordinate out to sea."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_45,There must be a reason why.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_46,Either myself or Anchor
d_ex_seayouagain_19_47,should tie a rope to our body and head towards wherever that thing was pointing.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_48,Hell no!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_49,I'm not doing that!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_50,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_51,"Fine, then I'll do it."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_52,You'll be responsible for pulling me back if I give you the signal.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_53,"That, I can manage."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_54,What about me?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_55,You'll be in charge of communications.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_56,"If anything happens to me, contact Seraphim and the others."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_57,Okay.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_58,"All right, then."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_59,Let's get everything prepared and head over there.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_60,A moment later.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_61,"The sea, which once had a pleasantly briny scent in the afternoon,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_62,now reeks of a damp fishy odor.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_63,"Ugh, that stench is horrendous."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_64,It was the same when we went into the bungalow.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_65,Looks like we're right on time.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_66,"Anchor, are you sensing anything on your radar?"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_67,Just a sec.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_68,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_69,Not yet.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_70,Let's move closer to the sea.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_71,*Splash* *Splash*
d_ex_seayouagain_19_72,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_73,There's something I just can't shake from my mind.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_74,Why is this ghost showing up?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_75,This kind of stuff is usually reserved for campfire stories.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_76,"This island has been deserted for quite a while,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_77,so there shouldn't be any souls lingering around that would turn into ghosts.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_78,It might be a ghost that's existed for a long time.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_79,We might all be hallucinating.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_80,... Well.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_81,"If ghosts are the souls of people who still have unfinished business in this world,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_82,surely there would be a reason it's still hanging around here.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_83,True...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_84,"If anything, I think it's more likely that we're all hallucinating."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_85,I think the possibility of that is pretty high.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_86,I've heard of this kind of thing before.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_87,If a group of people are so intensely
d_ex_seayouagain_19_88,"fixated on a single thought,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_89,it can end up manifesting itself
d_ex_seayouagain_19_90,as a kind of psychic apparition.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_91,*Beep beep*
d_ex_seayouagain_19_92,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_93,I'm picking up something on the radar.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_94,"It's coming from the middle of the sea, but it's heading straight towards us...fast."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_95,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_96,What direction is it coming from?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_97,Give us the exact coordinates.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_98,Just a second.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_99,8 o'clock. 1000 meters out... 700... 200...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_100,... 50.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_101,You're saying it's within 50 meters of us?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_102,Sssh.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_103,I can see something.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_104,You see that reddish color? It looks like Rapi's hair fluttering around.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_105,She's also got her hand raised above her head... wait.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_106,Is that an arm or a leg?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_107,...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_108,It's gone.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_109,I'm getting nothing on my radar.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_110,...?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_111,*Splash*
d_ex_seayouagain_19_112,What just happened?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_113,I don't know.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_114,Maybe it meant to go somewhere else...
d_ex_seayouagain_19_115,!!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_116,10 meters out!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_117,?!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_118,I suggest we get out of here.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_119,"As Helm takes my hand and yanks me around forcefully,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_120,something contorted into an unnatural shape starts crawling out of the water.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_121,What the hell is that?!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_122,Don't look at it!
d_ex_seayouagain_19_123,"I don't know why, but something tells me"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_124,"if you look it in the eye, something bad will happen."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_125,I thought we were going out to sea?
d_ex_seayouagain_19_126,We're scrapping the plan.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_127,"Now that we've seen what we're up against,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_128,we need to regroup.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_129,That night.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_130,"After beating a hasty retreat and barely outrunning the mysterious creature, we made it back to the shelter."
d_ex_seayouagain_19_131,None of us set foot outside until the sun was up.
d_ex_seayouagain_19_132,"The next morning, all along the path where we retreated,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_133,"there is a long trail of seaweed and moss piled up,"
d_ex_seayouagain_19_134,leaving behind a horrendous fishy stench.

d_ex_seayouagain_20_1,"After finishing her tasks, Pepper was hanging around the sea."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_2,*Splaaaash*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_3,The sea breeze is so refreshing.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_4,*Splaaaash Beebeep*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_5,Huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_6,*Splaaaash* *Beep beep*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_7,What's that sound?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_8,Pepper moves towards where the sound is coming from.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_9,*Beep beep beep*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_10,Anchor?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_11,Is that sound coming from you?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_12,"Yeah, it's my radar."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_13,"Are you looking for a glowing squid too, by any chance?"
d_ex_seayouagain_20_14,Uh... no.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_15,So that's where that sound
d_ex_seayouagain_20_16,was coming from.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_17,"Oh, hi Yan."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_18,Did you come for the glowing squid too?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_19,Glowing what? What is that?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_20,*Beep beep*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_21,There's nothing within a 2-meter radius.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_22,Anchor scurries to and fro.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_23,Seems like you're having a tough time finding this thing.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_24,Do you want me to help?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_25,Could you explain a few things about this glowing thingamajig?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_26,Is it worth a lot?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_27,"If it is, then I'll help."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_28,"Wow, you guys are willing to lend a hand?"
d_ex_seayouagain_20_29,That's great. I was getting tired of searching by myself.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_30,Mast already took off.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_31,"I'm not sure if I'll be of much help, though."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_32,"It's pretty dark out here, and I don't even know what it looks like."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_33,Don't worry about that.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_34,A glowing squid is just that: a squid that glows in the dark.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_35,You'll know it as soon as you see it.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_36,A bioluminescent squid? This could fetch a tidy profit.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_37,Count me in.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_38,"If either of you see a light shining in the sea, let me know."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_39,"Yan and Pepper scour the beach for a while,"
d_ex_seayouagain_20_40,but nary a trace of light can be seen in the dark ocean.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_41,Are we sure this glowing squid is a real thing?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_42,I don't see so much as a speck of light.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_43,Same here.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_44,Anchor said it would be easy to spot.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_45,Here she comes.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_46,Did you find anything?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_47,Nada. There must not be any in this area.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_48,It's apparently a rare species.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_49,"Why didn't you say that from the start?! Good grief, what a colossal waste of time."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_50,It's too bad we couldn't see one.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_51,You're telling me.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_52,"If this thing is as rare as she says, it's probably worth a fortune."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_53,Yan sighs.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_54,"At any rate, it's getting late."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_55,Let's head back.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_56,Wait.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_57,Huh? What is it?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_58,Thanks for helping me search for it.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_59,"Hehe, don't mention it. It was fun. It felt like a treasure hunt."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_60,I'd like to give you something to show my thanks.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_61,I'll show you something that shines nice and bright.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_62,Hyah!
d_ex_seayouagain_20_63,Anchor charges towards both of them.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_64,*Crash*
d_ex_seayouagain_20_65,Ahhh!
d_ex_seayouagain_20_66,Argh!
d_ex_seayouagain_20_67,"Anchor gives both Pepper and Yan a push, sending them tumbling to the ground."
d_ex_seayouagain_20_68,Is that how you repay something for a favor?!
d_ex_seayouagain_20_69,Ugh... everything is spinning.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_70,Anchor plops down on the ground beside the groaning Pepper and Yan.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_71,Look up.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_72,What are you talking ab... huh?
d_ex_seayouagain_20_73,Wow!
d_ex_seayouagain_20_74,"The sky is full of shining stars,"
d_ex_seayouagain_20_75,which appear so close that you could almost reach out and touch them.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_76,So pretty.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_77,They twinkle more than any jewel ever could.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_78,Hehe.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_79,It's like a pack of yellow starfish.
d_ex_seayouagain_20_80,So shiny.

d_ex_seayouagain_21_5,You later.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_6,Woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_7,Frima shakes her head.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_8,No.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_9,You use tomorrow.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_10,Woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_11,Negotiation over. Go away.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_12,Sleepy.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_13,*Whine*
d_ex_seayouagain_21_14,...
d_ex_seayouagain_21_15,Volt stares at Frima with sad puppy-dog eyes.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_16,... No. Today mine.

d_ex_seayouagain_21_20,Liter.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_21,Another hammock. Please.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_22,Woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_23,Busy?
d_ex_seayouagain_21_24,Hmmm.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_25,What's going on here?
d_ex_seayouagain_21_26,Can those two actually communicate?
d_ex_seayouagain_21_27,"Yan walks up beside me, staring at Volt and Frima with a look of curiosity."
d_ex_seayouagain_21_28,It appears so.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_29,Woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_30,Go away.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_31,Woof woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_32,... Fine.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_33,30 minutes.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_34,Woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_35,Deal?
d_ex_seayouagain_21_36,Woof woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_37,Volt scampers up to the hammock where Frima is lying down.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_38,How on earth are they able to understand each other?
d_ex_seayouagain_21_39,Maybe they're each able to guess what the other is saying.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_40,Sleep now.
d_ex_seayouagain_21_41,Woof!
d_ex_seayouagain_21_42,Zzzz...

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_4,Thanks for all the help.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_5,It's nothing. Just doing my job.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_6,Do you want to eat something before we go back in?

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_17,Hello!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_18,Out for a walk?
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_19,Yep! I wanted to try a new path.

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_21,"... Hello, Biscuit."

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_25,The dogs continue to stare at Marciana with unbridled exuberance.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_26,They certainly do.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_27,These guys are instinctively drawn towards animal lovers.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_28,"Do you like dogs, by any chance?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_29,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_30,I don't dislike them.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_31,That's great!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_32,"Since we bumped into each other, why don't we take a walk together?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_33,I'm fine with that.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_34,"Oh, um... I usually..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_35,Biscuit and the dogs all regard Marciana eagerly.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_36,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_37,I suppose it'll be possible for a little...

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_49,"Hi, Nero."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_50,Have you started going on walks too?
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_51,I didn't know cats went on walks.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_52,As if.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_53,Of course they do.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_54,"I came out because my new friend wanted to go outside, and we ended up all the way here."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_55,"It appears we've wandered pretty far out,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_56,so we should be getting back.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_57,Meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_58,The feline clearly has no intention of leaving Marciana's side.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_59,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_60,"Looks like she's taken a fancy to you, Marciana."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_61,Meow!

d_ex_wingofvictory_06_63,... Sorry?
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_64,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_65,"Fortunately, I brought a cat toy just in case something like this happened."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_66,You're more than welcome to use it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_67,Meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_68,The cat's eyes light up as soon as it sees the toy.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_69,But I...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_70,Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_71,But Nero...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_72,... Marciana is already joining us for a walk.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_73,Meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_74,"You won't have to play with her for long. Just for a few minutes, and then you can be on your way."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_75,Woof woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_76,But the dogs are really chomping at the bit to play too.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_77,Meoooow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_78,Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_79,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_80,"Both the cat and the dogs cling to Marciana,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_81,with neither side willing to budge an inch.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_82,Looks like we've got a bit of a stalemate.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_83,"Marciana, you're gonna have to make a decision."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_84,Seems so.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_85,Meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_86,Woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_87,Everyone glances at Marciana in anticipation.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_88,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_89,Uh... Commander...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_90,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_91,Help me out here.
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_92,"Sorry, can't help you."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_93,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_94,"In the end, Marciana went for a walk with the dogs."
d_ex_wingofvictory_06_95,"At the same time, she played with the cat using a drone. Only after she had played with every last animal was she able to return home."

d_ex_library_06_2,What kind of fruit do you like?
d_ex_library_06_3,Just a moment...
d_ex_library_06_4,Anne opens up her notebook.
d_ex_library_06_5,I like strawberries.
d_ex_library_06_6,...
d_ex_library_06_7,"As I pass through the entrance, I can hear familiar voices off in the racks."
d_ex_library_06_8,Let's say you have two baskets with five strawberries in each. How many strawberries do you have?
d_ex_library_06_9,Hmm...
d_ex_library_06_10,10?
d_ex_library_06_11,Correct.
d_ex_library_06_12,"For this problem, the 'x' here indicates the number of baskets."
d_ex_library_06_13,"So that's seven times two, which means there are seven strawberries in each of the baskets, right?"
d_ex_library_06_14,Exactly.
d_ex_library_06_15,"Hehe, you always make everything so easy to understand."
d_ex_library_06_16,That's because you're so smart.
d_ex_library_06_17,"Hello, you two."
d_ex_library_06_18,...!
d_ex_library_06_19,"Hey, Teacher."
d_ex_library_06_20,"Hello, Commander."
d_ex_library_06_21,I came to the library and ended up running into Miss Marciana.
d_ex_library_06_22,Studying with her is so much fun!
d_ex_library_06_23,She's the best teacher ever.
d_ex_library_06_24,Nobody beats Marciana when it comes to teaching.
d_ex_library_06_25,Any chance I can join you?
d_ex_library_06_26,So you already know about that?
d_ex_library_06_27,It's got nothing to do with me. It's just that Anne is such a quick learner.
d_ex_library_06_28,Sure! Let's study together.
d_ex_library_06_29,"You're not serious, are you, Commander?"
d_ex_library_06_30,What are you studying?
d_ex_library_06_31,Math.
d_ex_library_06_32,I need to solve the problems in this book I received today.
d_ex_library_06_33,I didn't know you were a fan of math.
d_ex_library_06_34,"Oh sure, my notebook told me that I love math."
d_ex_library_06_35,...
d_ex_library_06_36,Have you finished all the problems?
d_ex_library_06_37,"Yep, just got the last one done."
d_ex_library_06_38,It's honestly a bit disappointing that it's already over...
d_ex_library_06_39,You can always stay here a little longer.
d_ex_library_06_40,Would that be okay?
d_ex_library_06_41,Of course.
d_ex_library_06_42,Is there anything else you'd like to cover?
d_ex_library_06_43,... I actually don't know much.
d_ex_library_06_44,"If you're gonna be the one teaching me, then I'm willing to learn anything."
d_ex_library_06_45,...
d_ex_library_06_46,How about we learn a little more about cats?
d_ex_library_06_47,Cats...
d_ex_library_06_48,Anne hurriedly flips through her notebook.
d_ex_library_06_49,Sounds good! I mentioned here that I'm a big fan of tri-colored cats.
d_ex_library_06_50,...
d_ex_library_06_51,...
d_ex_library_06_52,"How about you go pick a book on cats, then?"
d_ex_library_06_53,I can choose whatever I want?
d_ex_library_06_54,"Sure, whatever you like."
d_ex_library_06_55,"Wow, okay!"
d_ex_library_06_56,Anne skips off to go choose a book.
d_ex_library_06_57,How did you two end up getting into an impromptu study session?
d_ex_library_06_58,We met at the library.
d_ex_library_06_59,How is it teaching Anne?
d_ex_library_06_60,She's a model student. She enjoys learning.
d_ex_library_06_61,For sure.
d_ex_library_06_62,"Although I have to say,"
d_ex_library_06_63,"last week, she was all about languages, and now it's math."
d_ex_library_06_64,...
d_ex_library_06_65,I'm back!
d_ex_library_06_66,Anne returns with a cute and colorful pop-up book filled with cat illustrations.
d_ex_library_06_67,...
d_ex_library_06_68,You picked a great book.
d_ex_library_06_69,Hehe. I figured this would be a real hoot to study with.
d_ex_library_06_70,Can I join you two?
d_ex_library_06_71,...
d_ex_library_06_72,Let's see what we have here.
d_ex_library_06_73,We all look at the book together.
d_ex_library_06_74,"Wow, this cat looks fascinating!"
d_ex_library_06_75,"In ancient times, some civilizations even worshipped them as gods."
d_ex_library_06_76,Really?!
d_ex_library_06_77,That's right.
d_ex_library_06_78,What about this cat?
d_ex_library_06_79,This cat is...
d_ex_library_06_80,Marciana answers each of Anne's questions in great detail.
d_ex_library_06_81,Miss Marciana...
d_ex_library_06_82,What is it?
d_ex_library_06_83,I feel a little sleepy.
d_ex_library_06_84,...
d_ex_library_06_85,I'm not surprised. You learned a lot today.
d_ex_library_06_86,"Hehe, thanks!"
d_ex_library_06_87,Miss Marciana...
d_ex_library_06_88,Could we do this again sometime?
d_ex_library_06_89,"Of course, anytime."
d_ex_library_06_90,Woohoo!
d_ex_library_06_91,...
d_ex_library_06_92,Today was such a blast!
d_ex_library_06_93,"Well, I oughta get going."
d_ex_library_06_94,"Get home safe, you two."
d_ex_library_06_95,"As Anne prances out of the library,"
d_ex_library_06_96,Marciana quietly watches her until she is out of sight.
d_ex_library_06_97,...
d_ex_library_06_98,"You've performed admirably, teaching her like you have."
d_ex_library_06_99,"It's nothing, honestly."
d_ex_library_06_100,So you've been teaching her for a while now?
d_ex_library_06_101,Yes.
d_ex_library_06_102,I usually visit the library to look up some information.
d_ex_library_06_103,Anne tends to visit the library in the afternoon on weekends.
d_ex_library_06_104,...
d_ex_library_06_105,Is that why you showed up here at the same time?
d_ex_library_06_106,...
d_ex_library_06_107,That's right.
d_ex_library_06_108,How are you holding up?
d_ex_library_06_109,What do you mean?
d_ex_library_06_110,"Everything you teach Anne, she ends up forgetting."
d_ex_library_06_111,...
d_ex_library_06_112,"Commander,"
d_ex_library_06_113,how do you ride a bicycle?
d_ex_library_06_114,I just... ride it?
d_ex_library_06_115,That's it.
d_ex_library_06_116,"Our ability to ride a bike is stored in our procedural memory, which belongs to the subconscious part of our brain."
d_ex_library_06_117,"This is all theoretical on my part,"
d_ex_library_06_118,"but I personally believe that if you learn something enough times, you can internalize that information"
d_ex_library_06_119,"in the subconscious part of your mind, just like it is with riding a bicycle."
d_ex_library_06_120,I see.
d_ex_library_06_121,"Besides, Anne has a strong passion for learning."
d_ex_library_06_122,"Even if she may not remember me once enough time passes,"
d_ex_library_06_123,she may be able to recall certain things she's been taught multiple times.
d_ex_library_06_124,"Of course, there's also the possibility that she may never remember anything."
d_ex_library_06_125,"That's true, but it's the struggle that gives this entire endeavor meaning."
d_ex_library_06_126,I'll help too.
d_ex_library_06_127,Yeah.
d_ex_library_06_128,You really did a good job despite the struggle.
d_ex_library_06_129,You will?
d_ex_library_06_130,Anne considers me her teacher as well.
d_ex_library_06_131,...
d_ex_library_06_132,"Thank you, Commander."

d_ex_maidcafe_06_2,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_3,I don't see anyone.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_4,I think I should head back.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_5,*Taptaptap*
d_ex_maidcafe_06_6,"Hey, Master!"
d_ex_maidcafe_06_7,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_8,"Welcome, Marciana."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_9,"Are you ready, Cocoa?"
d_ex_maidcafe_06_10,I was born ready.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_11,What's going on here?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_12,"I'll definitely cheer you up, Marciana."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_13,"I received a message from Master, and I prepared a magical special course just for you."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_14,You did?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_15,You didn't have to do all that...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_16,"Of course I have to! I've got to treat you to the best service, and nothing less."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_17,Cocoa turns and strides confidently into the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_18,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_19,Are you excited?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_20,"If you're feeling uncomfortable, just let me know."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_21,"Of course I am, but..."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_22,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_23,I feel bad for making things difficult for everyone just because of my bad mood.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_24,That's not it.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_25,I feel I've been causing trouble for so many people just because of my bad mood.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_26,I'm not sure if I can enjoy this...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_27,Don't feel like you have to put on an act. Just be natural.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_28,... All right.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_29,Here's the magical appetizer!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_30,Here's your bling bling teddy bear salad.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_31,...!?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_32,It looks delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_33,So... can I start eating?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_34,Just a second!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_35,I haven't done the most important step yet.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_36,"Before you dig in, you've got to recite the magic incantation."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_37,Okay...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_38,Master and I will demonstrate.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_39,We will?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_40,I'll start.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_41,May this dish be delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_42,May this dish be delicious.

d_ex_maidcafe_06_47,"This time, you and I will do it together, Marciana."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_48,Huh...?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_49,Right now?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_50,Yep! Now then...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_51,Wai...

d_ex_maidcafe_06_61,Amazing! Now you both can dig in.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_62,I'll go prepare the next course.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_63,Cocoa heads back to the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_64,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_65,You handled that well.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_66,Let's give this bling bling teddy bear salad a try.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_67,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_68,All right.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_69,How is it?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_70,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_71,It's delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_72,That's a relief.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_73,"When we almost finish the bling bling teddy bear salad, Cocoa appears once again."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_74,"This time, we've got an entrée brimming with magical power."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_75,BadaBOOM hearty omurice.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_76,"If anything's hearty, it's these portions."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_77,"Oh, I'm sure you can finish it with no problem."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_78,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_79,Don't tell me we've got to do another weird spell beforehand.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_80,We sure do!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_81,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_82,Master and I will give another demonstration.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_83,Again?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_84,BadaBOOM!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_85,... BadaBOOM!

d_ex_maidcafe_06_88,Make my heart spin round and round.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_89,Badump badump!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_90,"I knew you'd get into the swing of things, Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_91,... I'm not sure how I should feel about that.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_92,"All right. Marciana, you're up."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_93,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_94,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_95,I'm not sure I'm mentally prepared for th...

d_ex_maidcafe_06_97,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_98,Bada... BOOM.

d_ex_maidcafe_06_100,May... this omurice be... scrumdiddlyumptious.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_101,Make my heart spin round and round.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_102,... Badump.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_103,One more!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_104,... Badump.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_105,"Good, and now for the final flourish, just for you."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_106,I'll draw a unique pattern with the ketchup.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_107,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_108,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_109,"Since I'm doing this just for you, I'll draw Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_110,Cocoa skillfully squeezes out the ketchup for quite some time.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_111,*Squeeze squeeze*
d_ex_maidcafe_06_112,"Phew, that should do the trick."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_113,... Thanks Cocoa. It looks delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_114,"I'm a pro at this, so it's only natural that it looks good."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_115,... Can we start eating now?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_116,Yep! I'll be back in a jiffy.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_117,Cocoa runs into the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_118,"How are you doing, Marciana?"
d_ex_maidcafe_06_119,"You're beet red, Marciana."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_120,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_121,I'm fine.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_122,You don't look fine.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_123,It's okay. I can do this.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_124,I can do this.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_125,You just repeated yourself...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_126,Here I am!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_127,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_128,In Cocoa's hand is a small cake decorated with adorable patterns.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_129,"On the plate, painstakingly scrawled in ketchup are the words ""Cheer up, Marciana!""."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_130,...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_131,"This time, only Master and I will have to recite the magic incantation."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_132,"Are you ready, Master?"
d_ex_maidcafe_06_133,Ready.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_134,With the power of magic...
d_ex_maidcafe_06_135,spin round and round...

d_ex_maidcafe_06_141,That's all there is to it!
d_ex_maidcafe_06_142,What do you think?
d_ex_maidcafe_06_143,Simply remarkable.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_144,"Marciana, although I don't know what happened, you're always welcome to the Maid Cafe when you feel down."
d_ex_maidcafe_06_145,... Thanks.
d_ex_maidcafe_06_146,"Thank you, both of you."

d_ex_maidcafe_07_1,"As I arrive to meet Tia at the scheduled time, she greets me with a beaming smile."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_2,"Hey, Teacher!"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_3,*Hug*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_4,!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_5,"Oh, sorry! Sorry."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_6,I was just so happy to see you that I forgot.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_7,"Here, it's this way."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_8,The inside of the cafe is decorated
d_ex_maidcafe_07_9,with cute mascots and various decorations.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_10,Is there a special event today?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_11,This is what I was talking about on Bla.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_12,"For one day only, you can taste a limited edition parfait that is sold only once a month."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_13,"If you want to try it out, they sell tickets on the internet."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_14,"There aren't many to go around, so the competition is fierce. The purchase window opens at random times as well, so it's super tough to get your hands on one."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_15,Only those with unyielding determination can overcome the odds and get to taste this limited-edition parfait.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_16,"Even with Naga's help, I only just managed to get a ticket."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_17,Here it is. Isn't it adorable?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_18,Squeeee! I'm so thrilled!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_19,"A moment later, Tia exchanges the pink ticket for a parfait."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_20,"Wow, would you look at that?"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_21,The colors are so vibrant!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_22,The toppings are sensational!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_23,And they give you a generous portion.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_24,I can't find anything to possibly fault it for.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_25,"Teacher, can you hold it for a sec?"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_26,*Click*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_27,Hmm... that's not quite right.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_28,*Click click*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_29,That's not it either.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_30,*Click click click*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_31,None of these are really popping like I want them to.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_32,*Clickclickclickclickclick*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_33,Tia continues taking pictures until she is satisfied.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_34,"By that point, she's taken well over several hundred."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_35,"Thanks for holding it. Well, I say it's high time we try this bad boy!"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_36,This tastes...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_37,Cloyingly sweet. I feel like I'll get several cavities from it alone.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_38,Positively divine. It's like I've died and gone to heaven.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_39,"Hmm, maybe this is a bit much for you in terms of sweetness."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_40,"Next time, I'll treat you to something less sweet."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_41,I'm glad you like it!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_42,"Next time, I'll treat you to something even more delicious."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_43,"Tia and I are devouring the magnificent parfait, when..."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_44,This is...!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_45,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_46,Amazing...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_47,I notice a familiar face sitting at the opposite table.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_48,Marciana?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_49,"Oh, hey Miss Marciana."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_50,!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_51,*Smash*
d_ex_maidcafe_07_52,"Upon noticing the two of us,"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_53,Marciana drops the parfait spoon in her hands.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_54,What are you doing here?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_55,I... er...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_56,Marciana looks around nervously.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_57,What's up with her?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_58,Maybe she came here to keep up with the latest trends.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_59,Maybe she wanted to enjoy some alone time.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_60,I...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_61,"Er... no, that's not why I'm here."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_62,"Ah, I know!"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_63,You must have come here for the parfait as well.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_64,!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_65,I...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_66,I think there's been a misunderstanding.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_67,I most certainly did not come here to try this limited-edition parfait that they only sell once a month.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_68,"Nor do I find the toppings irresistible,"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_69,or the mascots adorable.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_70,"That's absolutely, positively not why I'm here."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_71,Hehe. Don't worry.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_72,This parfait isn't as bad as you might think.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_73,"I bet you were concerned that it potentially contained harmful ingredients, and came to try it for yourself."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_74,... Huh?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_75,"I'm right, aren't I? You worry too much."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_76,...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_77,That's right.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_78,"As a teacher, I should be mindful of what my students are consuming."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_79,"Like you said, though, there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with this parfait."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_80,"Since I've concluded my testing, I'll be off."
d_ex_maidcafe_07_81,...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_82,"Marciana shoots one last mournful glance at the unfinished parfait,"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_83,and reluctantly turns to leave.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_84,Just a moment.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_85,Yes?
d_ex_maidcafe_07_86,You left your parfait.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_87,But I...
d_ex_maidcafe_07_88,You should know better than to waste good food.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_89,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_07_90,My mistake.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_91,Thank you for reminding me.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_92,Marciana gingerly grabs the half-eaten parfait and leaves the cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_93,This parfait has been all the rage amongst the student body as of late.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_94,That's why Miss Marciana came here to see if everything was on the up and up.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_95,She truly is amazing.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_96,She sure is.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_97,"Now that this parfait has Miss Marciana's seal of approval,"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_98,I bet it's gonna be even harder to get one from now on.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_99,I'm glad I got the chance to try it out before it's impossible to get.
d_ex_maidcafe_07_100,"While I watch Tia dive into the rest of the parfait,"
d_ex_maidcafe_07_101,I find myself thinking about what a tough gig teaching is.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_title,Which is the Cutest?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_1,It's the one on page 187.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_2,The pattern on this black-belt starfish is simply exquisite.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_3,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_4,"Oooh, and check out page 512."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_5,Isn't this Gila monster adorable?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_6,"Get a load of that lumpy skin of his. I could just eat him up, hehe."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_7,Er...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_8,What about this one?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_9,"Oh, a dwarf rabbit. What a cutie-pie."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_10,Adorable.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_11,Irresistible.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_12,Right?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_13,Let's keep seeing what other cute animals we can find.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_14,... I'm good.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_15,Me too.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_16,Why not?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_17,Cause starfish are the cutest.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_18,"They're all cute, but there's nothing special about them."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_19,They lack that unique charm.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_20,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_21,What are you all up to?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_22,"Oh, hey Captain."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_23,"Hi, Teacher."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_24,*Hug*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_25,It's good to see you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_26,"It's a good thing you showed up, Captain."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_27,It's been tough fighting a solo battle this entire time.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_28,What's going on?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_29,Hear me out.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_30,Anchor wanted to go for a walk.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_31,"I said that sounded good, so I followed her out."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_32,"As we passed by the Goddess of Victory statue, we ran into Tia, who was reading a book."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_33,"Turns out, she was looking through a picture book"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_34,"filled with all sorts of cute animals,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_35,and she asked if we wanted to take a gander at it with her.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_36,This thing is filled with all sorts of cute marine life that Anchor loves.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_37,That's how we ended up stuck here.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_38,"Now, don't get me wrong."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_39,"I like a cute and cuddly critter as much as the next guy,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_40,but all the animals Tia has been showing us are far from cute.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_41,"If you ask me, they're positively hideous, but she's going gaga over them."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_42,I can't take it anymore!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_43,What do you mean? Everything I've shown you has been utterly adorable.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_44,"Teacher, look here."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_45,This is a Gila monster.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_46,"Those bright colors, those symmetrical scales... how could you resist that?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_47,Don't you wanna touch it?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_48,"Captain,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_49,take a gander at this fella.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_50,This is a black-belt starfish.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_51,The pattern is gorgeous.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_52,Check out how smooth it is. Just delightful.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_53,"Captain,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_54,I need you to focus.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_55,"Here, look at this dwarf rabbit."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_56,"If you look up cute in a dictionary, this picture will be next to the definition."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_57,Don't fall for these two and their bizarro definitions of cuteness.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_58,"Tia, Anchor, and Mast stare intently at me."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_59,Well?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_60,Which is the cutest?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_61,"Yeah, which one?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_62,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_63,The Gila monster is the cutest.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_64,The black-belt starfish is the cutest.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_65,The dwarf rabbit is the cutest.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_66,"See, I told you!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_67,"I knew I could count on you, Teacher."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_68,"You have a good eye, hehe."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_69,"I hope one day, I'll be able to raise one."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_70,"Every time we go up to the surface on a mission,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_71,I'll keep my eyes peeled for one.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_72,This stinks...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_73,"You certainly... have unique tastes, Captain."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_74,Captain.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_75,I knew I could trust your judgment.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_76,"If I ever end up finding a real-life starfish,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_77,I'll be sure to show it to you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_78,Scout's honor!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_79,"Teacher, I'm disappointed in you."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_80,I never would have thought you'd be into that kind of animal.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_81,Just look at those round button eyes!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_82,Those perky ears!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_83,How can you possibly resist such cuteness?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_84,I knew you weren't a weirdo like these two.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_85,I'm looking even more forward to working with you now.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_86,This stinks...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_87,"How could you choose the rabbit, Teacher?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_88,"The resentful glares of the two disappointed parties are quickly becoming too much for me,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_06_89,so I beat a swift retreat.
d_ex_tower_06_title,First Encounter with a Dragon
d_ex_tower_06_1,Where are you off to this early in the morning?
d_ex_tower_06_2,"Hey, Teacher."
d_ex_tower_06_3,I think I can finally fulfill my lifelong wish.
d_ex_tower_06_4,I'm gonna be able to meet a dragon face-to-face!
d_ex_tower_06_5,Say that again?
d_ex_tower_06_6,A real dragon?
d_ex_tower_06_7,Yep!
d_ex_tower_06_8,The genuine article!
d_ex_tower_06_9,"After hearing Tia's absurd proclamation,"
d_ex_tower_06_10,"I'm filled with a sense of unease, and start to follow her."
d_ex_tower_06_11,Are you also interested in seeing a dragon?
d_ex_tower_06_12,Of course. You have to introduce me.
d_ex_tower_06_13,It could be dangerous. I've got to protect you.
d_ex_tower_06_14,Sure. I'll introduce you as the person
d_ex_tower_06_15,who will accompany me for a lifetime.
d_ex_tower_06_16,Ha!
d_ex_tower_06_17,"You're so cool, Teacher. Hehe."
d_ex_tower_06_18,I feel much safer when you're with me.
d_ex_tower_06_19,Is the dragon supposed to be here?
d_ex_tower_06_20,"Well, to tell you the truth..."
d_ex_tower_06_21,You're late.
d_ex_tower_06_22,"Hey, Exia."
d_ex_tower_06_23,I got here early and set up Dragon Dungeon.
d_ex_tower_06_24,"Inside the outpost,"
d_ex_tower_06_25,here is where we'll get the best reception.
d_ex_tower_06_26,"When you say dragon, you mean...?"
d_ex_tower_06_27,"Not long ago, I consulted Exia about my concerns."
d_ex_tower_06_28,I said I wanted to meet a dragon and asked if there was any way to make that happen.
d_ex_tower_06_29,"She said if I wanted to meet a dragon,"
d_ex_tower_06_30,I could easily meet one here at this Radio Tower.
d_ex_tower_06_31,So that's why we're here right now.
d_ex_tower_06_32,"First off, I'll need you to take this."
d_ex_tower_06_33,Huh? Is this a game console?
d_ex_tower_06_34,Are we gonna use this to summon it?
d_ex_tower_06_35,So cool!
d_ex_tower_06_36,Correct.
d_ex_tower_06_37,"Noob,"
d_ex_tower_06_38,you should participate as well.
d_ex_tower_06_39,Exia hands me another gaming console.
d_ex_tower_06_40,Why me?
d_ex_tower_06_41,"If you want to meet a dragon, you must first defeat the boss."
d_ex_tower_06_42,"The best party combination is a healer, a tank, and a damage dealer."
d_ex_tower_06_43,Choose one of the three.
d_ex_tower_06_44,"Oooh, can I be the damage dealer?"
d_ex_tower_06_45,Her outfit is super pretty.
d_ex_tower_06_46,...
d_ex_tower_06_47,"The less armor the character wears, the higher their innate defense is. I'm impressed that you noticed that."
d_ex_tower_06_48,You clearly know what you're doing.
d_ex_tower_06_49,I'll be the tank.
d_ex_tower_06_50,Noob can be the healer.
d_ex_tower_06_51,"If we go full bore with this, we should be able to clear it today."
d_ex_tower_06_52,Let's go.
d_ex_tower_06_53,Tally ho!
d_ex_tower_06_54,1 hour later.
d_ex_tower_06_55,Eeya! Hyah! Huh? Is this how you do it?
d_ex_tower_06_56,You're doing just fine. Keep listening to my commands.
d_ex_tower_06_57,"As for you, Noob,"
d_ex_tower_06_58,we'll be up the creek without a paddle if the healer gets offed.
d_ex_tower_06_59,How is Tia putting you to shame? It's her first time playing the game.
d_ex_tower_06_60,... I'll try harder.
d_ex_tower_06_61,5 hours later.
d_ex_tower_06_62,*Bam* *Kabooooom*
d_ex_tower_06_63,"Dang, this is tough."
d_ex_tower_06_64,"Whoa, hey now! Did we get it?"
d_ex_tower_06_65,You just dealt loads of damage to the mini-boss.
d_ex_tower_06_66,I underestimated you.
d_ex_tower_06_67,Er... could one of you revive me?
d_ex_tower_06_68,"I'm coming to save you, Teacher!"
d_ex_tower_06_69,"Noob, you're being resurrected by an honest-to-goodness Noob..."
d_ex_tower_06_70,You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
d_ex_tower_06_71,12 hours later.
d_ex_tower_06_72,*Bam* *Kabooooom*
d_ex_tower_06_73,Yahoo! We beat the boss!
d_ex_tower_06_74,We cleared the stage!
d_ex_tower_06_75,"Nicely done, Teacher! And you too, Exia."
d_ex_tower_06_76,...
d_ex_tower_06_77,I feel we could have done that without the healer.
d_ex_tower_06_78,"You did good, Tia."
d_ex_tower_06_79,Now can I meet a dragon?
d_ex_tower_06_80,Watch the screen carefully.
d_ex_tower_06_81,"Thank you for saving me, great warrior Tia."
d_ex_tower_06_82,My name is Lucius.
d_ex_tower_06_83,I am the Light Dragon who was trying to save this world from the Demon King.
d_ex_tower_06_84,"Unfortunately, my power has not fully returned yet and I am still weak."
d_ex_tower_06_85,That is why I will need more help from you.
d_ex_tower_06_86,I shall call upon you in the future.
d_ex_tower_06_87,"On the screen, the white dragon lets out a great roar and flies away,"
d_ex_tower_06_88,slowly vanishing into the distance.
d_ex_tower_06_89,"... Tia, I'm sor..."
d_ex_tower_06_90,Ohmygodohmygod!
d_ex_tower_06_91,"Exia, this is amazing!"
d_ex_tower_06_92,...?
d_ex_tower_06_93,Hehe.
d_ex_tower_06_94,See?
d_ex_tower_06_95,Told ya you could meet one.
d_ex_tower_06_96,But that wasn't even a real dragon...
d_ex_tower_06_97,"You're amazing, Exia!"
d_ex_tower_06_98,I wanna meet Lucius again!
d_ex_tower_06_99,How do I do that?
d_ex_tower_06_100,But that...
d_ex_tower_06_101,"If you want to see him again, you've got to install Dragon Dungeon 2."
d_ex_tower_06_102,... was all just a video game.
d_ex_tower_06_103,*Bam* *Kabooooom*
d_ex_tower_06_104,Can I be the damage dealer again?
d_ex_tower_06_105,Sure thing.
d_ex_tower_06_106,I'll go for the tank again as well.
d_ex_tower_06_107,...
d_ex_tower_06_108,"I, the lonely healer, quietly show myself out."
d_ex_cafe_06_title,A Perpetual Dessert Shoot
d_ex_cafe_06_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_cafe_06_2,Hey.
d_ex_cafe_06_3,"Come on in, Pal."
d_ex_cafe_06_4,I heard you're holding a dessert tasting session?
d_ex_cafe_06_5,We sure are! You came at just the right time.
d_ex_cafe_06_6,But you don't usually sell desserts here...
d_ex_cafe_06_7,"Not usually, no."
d_ex_cafe_06_8,"So today, I plan to try desserts from various places, and if I find any that are good, I might even try to research their recipes!"
d_ex_cafe_06_9,We've had a bit of a dip in customers lately.
d_ex_cafe_06_10,So annoying.
d_ex_cafe_06_11,"If you're so upset about it, then think of ways to earn some more money!"
d_ex_cafe_06_12,Too. Troublesome.
d_ex_cafe_06_13,"You're something else, you know that?"
d_ex_cafe_06_14,Hold up.
d_ex_cafe_06_15,Why don't I see any desserts?
d_ex_cafe_06_16,"Oh, we've got someone else to grab that for us."
d_ex_cafe_06_17,*Jingle*
d_ex_cafe_06_18,"Hey, guys!"
d_ex_cafe_06_19,"Oh! Hey, Teacher!"
d_ex_cafe_06_20,*Hug*
d_ex_cafe_06_21,Hehe!
d_ex_cafe_06_22,"Tia, the dessert boxes you're holding are going to get crushed!"
d_ex_cafe_06_23,"Besides, you know how embarrassed Teacher gets when you hug him like that."
d_ex_cafe_06_24,"With that said, Naga starts prying Tia away from me."
d_ex_cafe_06_25,"Anyway, how are you all doing?"
d_ex_cafe_06_26,"I hope Tia's enthusiastic greeting didn't startle you too much, Teacher."
d_ex_cafe_06_27,"We're still working on her etiquette, so please forgive us."
d_ex_cafe_06_28,"Oops, sorry about that."
d_ex_cafe_06_29,I'm just so happy to see you. Hehe.
d_ex_cafe_06_30,"It's all good, as long as the desserts are okay. Thanks for getting them."
d_ex_cafe_06_31,So. Many.
d_ex_cafe_06_32,When you mentioned that someone else would be getting the desserts...
d_ex_cafe_06_33,"I meant them, yes."
d_ex_cafe_06_34,Did you get everything on the list?
d_ex_cafe_06_35,Of course!
d_ex_cafe_06_36,I scoured social media and compiled a list of the most sought-after desserts.
d_ex_cafe_06_37,"Hold on, let me plate them up."
d_ex_cafe_06_38,Tia starts setting up the desserts in a flurry of activity.
d_ex_cafe_06_39,So. Fast.
d_ex_cafe_06_40,"When it comes to desserts, we know what we're doing."
d_ex_cafe_06_41,"Wow, they look amazing!"
d_ex_cafe_06_42,I can't wait to give it a try!
d_ex_cafe_06_43,*Clink*
d_ex_cafe_06_44,Tia throws her fork across the table and intercepts Milk's fork just inches from the cake.
d_ex_cafe_06_45,W-what the...?!
d_ex_cafe_06_46,"Whoa there, hold your horses now."
d_ex_cafe_06_47,I'm not done setting them up.
d_ex_cafe_06_48,You're not?
d_ex_cafe_06_49,All. Unpacked.
d_ex_cafe_06_50,"Oh, my dears. That's just the beginning."
d_ex_cafe_06_51,Tia still has several more steps to complete.
d_ex_cafe_06_52,"All of a sudden, Tia leaps onto her chair"
d_ex_cafe_06_53,and starts taking photos of the desserts.
d_ex_cafe_06_54,*Click*
d_ex_cafe_06_55,?
d_ex_cafe_06_56,"No, that's not it..."
d_ex_cafe_06_57,*Click click click*
d_ex_cafe_06_58,"This just isn't the one, and that's not it either!"
d_ex_cafe_06_59,*Click click click click click click*
d_ex_cafe_06_60,Bright. Eyes hurt.
d_ex_cafe_06_61,This shot appears to be underexposed.
d_ex_cafe_06_62,The cake decorations seem a bit crooked in this one.
d_ex_cafe_06_63,This one doesn't look appetizing enough.
d_ex_cafe_06_64,Tia moves with such an intense passion that nobody dares to interrupt her.
d_ex_cafe_06_65,Hmm...
d_ex_cafe_06_66,Something tells me we won't get to try any of these desserts today.
d_ex_cafe_06_67,What are you talking about?
d_ex_cafe_06_68,I asked you to buy these for us!
d_ex_cafe_06_69,"Tia won't touch these until she's captured the perfect shot,"
d_ex_cafe_06_70,"and considering how many desserts you had us buy,"
d_ex_cafe_06_71,I'd say tomorrow is the soonest we'll possibly be eating.
d_ex_cafe_06_72,No way! You've gotta be kidding me!
d_ex_cafe_06_73,"Frima, do something!"
d_ex_cafe_06_74,Sleep mask. Comfy.
d_ex_cafe_06_75,Now. Dark.
d_ex_cafe_06_76,What?
d_ex_cafe_06_77,Me. Sleep.
d_ex_cafe_06_78,*Snore*
d_ex_cafe_06_79,Aaargh!
d_ex_cafe_06_80,"Here you go, Milk."
d_ex_cafe_06_81,What is this?
d_ex_cafe_06_82,A cookie?
d_ex_cafe_06_83,"Hey, just a heads-up,"
d_ex_cafe_06_84,"this might not be as good as what Tia got from those famous stores,"
d_ex_cafe_06_85,It's actually something that I prepared for her.
d_ex_cafe_06_86,but you're more than welcome to have it if you'd like.
d_ex_cafe_06_87,"Thanks,"
d_ex_cafe_06_88,that's really sweet of you!
d_ex_cafe_06_89,I won't forget this!
d_ex_cafe_06_90,Don't sweat it!
d_ex_cafe_06_91,"I'm really sorry that Tia's such a handful,"
d_ex_cafe_06_92,but your understanding means a lot to me.
d_ex_cafe_06_93,It is said that Tia was so incredibly passionate that her dessert shoot stretched on well into the next day.
d_ex_elevator_06_title,A Worrisome Team
d_ex_elevator_06_1,It's been ages since our last mission together. I can hardly contain my excitement!
d_ex_elevator_06_2,The only thing is...
d_ex_elevator_06_3,"I'm on another mission with Teacher?! I must be the luckiest person alive, hehe!"
d_ex_elevator_06_4,"Tia,"
d_ex_elevator_06_5,what did I say about respecting Teacher's personal space?
d_ex_elevator_06_6,Are these two coming as well?
d_ex_elevator_06_7,That's right.
d_ex_elevator_06_8,"Hello, Viper!"
d_ex_elevator_06_9,"My, my, aren't you a bubbly one?"
d_ex_elevator_06_10,She sure is.
d_ex_elevator_06_11,Does she always throw herself on Honey like this?
d_ex_elevator_06_12,"I've been trying to get through to her, but she may still act inappropriately at times, Teacher."
d_ex_elevator_06_13,"So, could you maybe, you know, cut her some slack and let this one slide?"
d_ex_elevator_06_14,What can I do? I just love Teacher to bits!
d_ex_elevator_06_15,"With that, Tia inches in closer than ever before."
d_ex_elevator_06_16,Don't you think you're getting a tad too cozy with the kid?
d_ex_elevator_06_17,"How about you scooch over here a bit, Honey?"
d_ex_elevator_06_18,Viper refuses to give in to this and forcefully pulls me closer to her.
d_ex_elevator_06_19,Wa-wait!
d_ex_elevator_06_20,*Thud* *Crash*
d_ex_elevator_06_21,"I lose my footing and end up sprawling out on the elevator floor, right alongside Viper and Tia."
d_ex_elevator_06_22,"Due to the impact, the elevator rattles and sways with such force."
d_ex_elevator_06_23,Are you all okay?
d_ex_elevator_06_24,*Rumble*
d_ex_elevator_06_25,!
d_ex_elevator_06_26,Hmm...?
d_ex_elevator_06_27,Eh?
d_ex_elevator_06_28,It stopped?
d_ex_elevator_06_29,Is it because of your fall? Could that have caused it?
d_ex_elevator_06_30,"I'm sure it'll be fixed soon, right?"
d_ex_elevator_06_31,"But it's kinda nice, though, getting to spend more time with Teacher, hehe."
d_ex_elevator_06_32,Erm...
d_ex_elevator_06_33,"I think it really sucks being cooped up in this confined space for so long,"
d_ex_elevator_06_34,so I hope it gets fixed right away.
d_ex_elevator_06_35,"At some point, Naga darts over to my side."
d_ex_elevator_06_36,Methinks you two are a little too chummy with Honey.
d_ex_elevator_06_37,"If both of you have claimed spots on both sides,"
d_ex_elevator_06_38,then...
d_ex_elevator_06_39,Viper takes a seat right in front of me and wraps her arms around my neck.
d_ex_elevator_06_40,I'll choose this spot.
d_ex_elevator_06_41,Tia is to my left.
d_ex_elevator_06_42,Hehe!
d_ex_elevator_06_43,Naga to my right.
d_ex_elevator_06_44,...
d_ex_elevator_06_45,And Viper in front of me.
d_ex_elevator_06_46,Hmm...
d_ex_elevator_06_47,Being surrounded by three Nikkes in such close proximity
d_ex_elevator_06_48,causes my breathing to become ragged.
d_ex_elevator_06_49,It's too stuffy in here...
d_ex_elevator_06_50,Can you all give me some space?
d_ex_elevator_06_51,Like this?
d_ex_elevator_06_52,"Against my wishes, Viper draws closer."
d_ex_elevator_06_53,!
d_ex_elevator_06_54,Right before her face brushed against mine...
d_ex_elevator_06_55,I think you've taken this joke far enough.
d_ex_elevator_06_56,Teacher is clearly uncomfortable.
d_ex_elevator_06_57,"Proficient in handling such situations, Naga swiftly pries the amorous Viper off of me."
d_ex_elevator_06_58,"My, oh, my, look at how innocent you are!"
d_ex_elevator_06_59,"Also, you've got quite the powerful arms there."
d_ex_elevator_06_60,It seems I shouldn't underestimate you just because of your age.
d_ex_elevator_06_61,"Thanks, I'll take that as a compliment!"
d_ex_elevator_06_62,"That goes for you too, Tia."
d_ex_elevator_06_63,Give Teacher some space.
d_ex_elevator_06_64,Okay.
d_ex_elevator_06_65,Phew...
d_ex_elevator_06_66,"Now that everyone's out of my personal space, I can finally breathe more freely."
d_ex_elevator_06_67,*Rumble*
d_ex_elevator_06_68,*Buzz*
d_ex_elevator_06_69,Look at that! It seems the elevator has been fixed!
d_ex_elevator_06_70,"And just like that, the elevator starts running again."
d_ex_elevator_06_71,"Thanks for the help, Naga."
d_ex_elevator_06_72,"No, I can't believe it took me this long to realize."
d_ex_elevator_06_73,I'm really sorry that you had to go through all of that.
d_ex_elevator_06_74,"It's just that every time I'm near you, it's like all my worries disappear, and I just get lost in the moment."
d_ex_elevator_06_75,"Hey, don't sweat it. You can relax and be yourself around me."
d_ex_elevator_06_76,Hehe.
d_ex_elevator_06_77,That's sweet of you to say.
d_ex_elevator_06_78,*Rumble*
d_ex_elevator_06_79,The elevator shakes again.
d_ex_elevator_06_80,?!
d_ex_elevator_06_81,"Jeez, what is it this time?"
d_ex_elevator_06_82,"Wait, don't cling to me, just talk!"
d_ex_elevator_06_83,Is that a snake on your head?
d_ex_elevator_06_84,"I should really take a closer look, hehe."
d_ex_elevator_06_85,Tia!
d_ex_elevator_06_86,You can't do that!
d_ex_elevator_06_87,... Is today the day
d_ex_elevator_06_88,when this mission is successfully completed?
d_ex_shopping_07_title,Cuteness Explosion
d_ex_shopping_07_1,"Hey, Teacher!"
d_ex_shopping_07_2,"Hello, Commander."
d_ex_shopping_07_3,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_shopping_07_4,What else can we do at a shopping mall?
d_ex_shopping_07_5,"Of course, it's shopping, silly!"
d_ex_shopping_07_6,"I get Naga coming here, but I'm surprised to see you, Marciana."
d_ex_shopping_07_7,I...
d_ex_shopping_07_8,"Miss Marciana came with me as my guardian, hehe."
d_ex_shopping_07_9,Correct.
d_ex_shopping_07_10,"Since Tia's bag looks rather plain,"
d_ex_shopping_07_11,I'm thinking of sprucing it up with some cute accessories.
d_ex_shopping_07_12,"While we're at it, I also wanna check out things that'll suit my style."
d_ex_shopping_07_13,"What do you say? Care to join us, Teacher? I could really use a hand!"
d_ex_shopping_07_14,Me?
d_ex_shopping_07_15,"If it's something you handpicked, I'm sure she'll snap it on without a second thought!"
d_ex_shopping_07_16,"Gotcha, let's go."
d_ex_shopping_07_17,"Thanks, Teacher!"
d_ex_shopping_07_18,"Thank you, Commander."
d_ex_shopping_07_19,"With that, we step into a store."
d_ex_shopping_07_20,"Whoa! Check this out, Teacher!"
d_ex_shopping_07_21,Isn't this purple lace key ring adorable?
d_ex_shopping_07_22,And this red bowknot is to die for!
d_ex_shopping_07_23,"Omg, I can't decide between these two!"
d_ex_shopping_07_24,Which one should I get?
d_ex_shopping_07_25,The purple lace key ring.
d_ex_shopping_07_26,The red bowknot.
d_ex_shopping_07_27,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_07_28,"That sounds good,"
d_ex_shopping_07_29,"but you know what, I think I'll buy them both!"
d_ex_shopping_07_30,Be right back!
d_ex_shopping_07_31,Naga dashes to the cashier at lightning speed.
d_ex_shopping_07_32,... Wow.
d_ex_shopping_07_33,She really...
d_ex_shopping_07_34,...
d_ex_shopping_07_35,...
d_ex_shopping_07_36,That doll in your hand is cute.
d_ex_shopping_07_37,"Oh, this?"
d_ex_shopping_07_38,Do you want it?
d_ex_shopping_07_39,"Oh, n-no."
d_ex_shopping_07_40,I just thought this may be a good gift for Tia.
d_ex_shopping_07_41,Does Tia like dolls?
d_ex_shopping_07_42,"Tia is adorable,"
d_ex_shopping_07_43,so I thought this would be perfect for her.
d_ex_shopping_07_44,"But, if she doesn't like dolls, then never mind..."
d_ex_shopping_07_45,Just as Marciana is about to place the doll back on the shelf...
d_ex_shopping_07_46,*Snatch*
d_ex_shopping_07_47,!
d_ex_shopping_07_48,You think this doll suits Tia?
d_ex_shopping_07_49,I do.
d_ex_shopping_07_50,"It's pretty cute, isn't it? Hehe."
d_ex_shopping_07_51,"All right, then. I'll grab this as well."
d_ex_shopping_07_52,Hold on!
d_ex_shopping_07_53,"In the blink of an eye, Naga swiftly dashes to the cashier once more."
d_ex_shopping_07_54,...
d_ex_shopping_07_55,"Nobody knows Tia like Naga does,"
d_ex_shopping_07_56,so it'll be fine.
d_ex_shopping_07_57,That's reassuring.
d_ex_shopping_07_58,"Even after that, Naga's half-crazed shopping spree showed no signs of stopping."
d_ex_shopping_07_59,This nail polish would be perfect for Tia!
d_ex_shopping_07_60,"And this key ring is a limited edition, Teacher!"
d_ex_shopping_07_61,Oh my gosh! I've got to buy this!
d_ex_shopping_07_62,Once the shopping spree comes to an end...
d_ex_shopping_07_63,"All right. I'm off, then."
d_ex_shopping_07_64,"Thanks for the help, Teacher."
d_ex_shopping_07_65,I'll be sure to tell Tia that you chose it for her!
d_ex_shopping_07_66,Although I've not selected anything throughout the entire shopping spree...
d_ex_shopping_07_67,Okay.
d_ex_shopping_07_68,"Goodbye, Commander."
d_ex_shopping_07_69,"Let's head back, Naga."
d_ex_shopping_07_70,"Here, Miss Marciana."
d_ex_shopping_07_71,This is for you.
d_ex_shopping_07_72,Naga hands the doll she purchased earlier to Marciana.
d_ex_shopping_07_73,Why are you giving this to me?
d_ex_shopping_07_74,Tia doesn't like dolls that much.
d_ex_shopping_07_75,But neither do I.
d_ex_shopping_07_76,"I know,"
d_ex_shopping_07_77,but it's such a shame to just chuck it away.
d_ex_shopping_07_78,Look at how cute it is!
d_ex_shopping_07_79,"Since you even took the time to go shopping with me today,"
d_ex_shopping_07_80,can't you accept it as a gift from your student?
d_ex_shopping_07_81,...
d_ex_shopping_07_82,Will you not accept it?
d_ex_shopping_07_83,I...
d_ex_shopping_07_84,You're gonna make the doll cry!
d_ex_shopping_07_85,"Just look at her, she's absolutely heartbroken."
d_ex_shopping_07_86,...!
d_ex_shopping_07_87,*Snatch*
d_ex_shopping_07_88,"Just as Naga's final words fall, Marciana snatches the doll and surveys her surroundings."
d_ex_shopping_07_89,Would you look at that? Her smile has returned now that you've accepted her.
d_ex_shopping_07_90,... That's great.
d_ex_shopping_07_91,I'm glad to hear that.
d_ex_shopping_07_92,You're just so adorable!
d_ex_shopping_07_93,Huh? What was that?
d_ex_shopping_07_94,Nothing. Let's go!
d_ex_powerplant_05_title,Hand in Hand
d_ex_powerplant_05_1,Yeah. There. Hold it tight.
d_ex_powerplant_05_2,"I'll give you a signal after splicing these wires together, and then you plug them in as hard as you can."
d_ex_powerplant_05_3,Be careful of high voltage.
d_ex_powerplant_05_4,... How?
d_ex_powerplant_05_5,Hmm... Keep your eyes on them?
d_ex_powerplant_05_6,... Got it.
d_ex_powerplant_05_7,I came over looking to have fun but ran into Maxwell who was repairing the generator.
d_ex_powerplant_05_8,"She caught me off guard, so I offered to help, but now I'm not so sure about this..."
d_ex_powerplant_05_9,"Ah, don't worry. If anything goes wrong, we won't die."
d_ex_powerplant_05_10,At least I won't.
d_ex_powerplant_05_11,...
d_ex_powerplant_05_12,"All right, I'm splicing them together now. One, two..."
d_ex_powerplant_05_13,*Clang*
d_ex_powerplant_05_14,Drake rolls in with a loud crash.
d_ex_powerplant_05_15,*Huff  huff*
d_ex_powerplant_05_16,Ah...! They're still chasing me...!
d_ex_powerplant_05_17,Maxwell! Help me hide!
d_ex_powerplant_05_18,No. Out.
d_ex_powerplant_05_19,What?
d_ex_powerplant_05_20,"I don't know what's going on, but get out. We're working on something important right now."
d_ex_powerplant_05_21,How can you be so heartless? Someone's after me!
d_ex_powerplant_05_22,Probably because you caused trouble.
d_ex_powerplant_05_23,True.
d_ex_powerplant_05_24,Just get out already! We're busy!
d_ex_powerplant_05_25,Sorry!
d_ex_powerplant_05_26,Did Drake come here by any chance?
d_ex_powerplant_05_27,...!!
d_ex_powerplant_05_28,... What's this about?
d_ex_powerplant_05_29,"Drake recorded over the police siren with the sound of her laughing, so we're trying to find her."
d_ex_powerplant_05_30,"We rode out without realizing she'd changed it and someone filed a complaint...! Apparently, the sound was too frightening...!"
d_ex_powerplant_05_31,... I see.
d_ex_powerplant_05_32,I thought I saw her come this way. You didn't see her?
d_ex_powerplant_05_33,The girl you're talking to is Drake.
d_ex_powerplant_05_34,Ahah! Gotcha!
d_ex_powerplant_05_35,Ah! Oh no!
d_ex_powerplant_05_36,Drake! I'm here to take you down to the police station.
d_ex_powerplant_05_37,No!
d_ex_powerplant_05_38,Why?
d_ex_powerplant_05_39,You don't have air conditioning there. It's hot.
d_ex_powerplant_05_40,We do. I'll turn it on for you.
d_ex_powerplant_05_41,Is it a central air-conditioning?
d_ex_powerplant_05_42,It's a wall-mounted one.
d_ex_powerplant_05_43,Then no!
d_ex_powerplant_05_44,... Just cuff her up and drag her out.
d_ex_powerplant_05_45,"... Well,"
d_ex_powerplant_05_46,excuse me then!
d_ex_powerplant_05_47,Dang... What do I do...?
d_ex_powerplant_05_48,What? Let go! Get your hands off that...!
d_ex_powerplant_05_49,*Grab*
d_ex_powerplant_05_50,*Crackle*
d_ex_powerplant_05_51,Arrgghh!
d_ex_powerplant_05_52,Argh! Don't touch the wire! I'm repairing it!
d_ex_powerplant_05_53,I'll save you!!
d_ex_powerplant_05_54,Villain! Rescue!!
d_ex_powerplant_05_55,No! Don't touch...!!
d_ex_powerplant_05_56,*Grab*
d_ex_powerplant_05_57,*Crackle*
d_ex_powerplant_05_58,Arrgghh!
d_ex_powerplant_05_59,You idiot! Why would you touch her with your bare hand?
d_ex_powerplant_05_60,Let me handle this!
d_ex_powerplant_05_61,"What!? No, stop...!"
d_ex_powerplant_05_62,*Grab*
d_ex_powerplant_05_63,*Crackle*
d_ex_powerplant_05_64,Arrgghhhh!

d_ex_gym_06_3,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_06_4,Ow... that hurts.
d_ex_gym_06_5,*Sigh*
d_ex_gym_06_6,I'm ready!
d_ex_gym_06_7,What are you all up to?
d_ex_gym_06_8,"Hello, Commander."
d_ex_gym_06_9,"Since Quiry is a new addition to the team, we thought that working out together would be a good team-building exercise."
d_ex_gym_06_10,I'm putting my best foot forward!
d_ex_gym_06_11,"That's a good mindset, Miranda."
d_ex_gym_06_12,You're all getting me inspired right now.
d_ex_gym_06_13,"Would you like to join us, Commander?"
d_ex_gym_06_14,Is that okay?
d_ex_gym_06_15,Well... that wasn't part of my original plan...
d_ex_gym_06_16,"Sure it is. If you join us, we'll all be bound to work harder."
d_ex_gym_06_17,It's good to be spontaneous sometimes.
d_ex_gym_06_18,It'll be fun if we all work out together!
d_ex_gym_06_19,"Okay, let's do it."
d_ex_gym_06_20,What kind of exercise should we start with?
d_ex_gym_06_21,I heard it's good to start with cardio first.
d_ex_gym_06_22,How about a light run on the treadmill?
d_ex_gym_06_23,Sounds good to me.
d_ex_gym_06_24,Same here.
d_ex_gym_06_25,"How about you, Quiry? You okay with that?"
d_ex_gym_06_26,I'm fine with it.
d_ex_gym_06_27,Quiry addresses her response to the pile of towels lying next to Poli.
d_ex_gym_06_28,*Sigh*
d_ex_gym_06_29,"All right, let's do it."
d_ex_gym_06_30,All of us head to our respective treadmills.
d_ex_gym_06_31,Do we press this button to start?
d_ex_gym_06_32,"Yep, that's the one."
d_ex_gym_06_33,*Beep*
d_ex_gym_06_34,And this button adjusts the speed.
d_ex_gym_06_35,*Beeep*
d_ex_gym_06_36,*Beeeeeep*
d_ex_gym_06_37,Gaaah!
d_ex_gym_06_38,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_06_39,Ouch...
d_ex_gym_06_40,Quiry's treadmill went berserk!
d_ex_gym_06_41,I just wanted to turn it on...
d_ex_gym_06_42,You'd already pressed the power button.
d_ex_gym_06_43,The one next to it is to increase the speed.
d_ex_gym_06_44,"If you keep slamming it down like that, not even Nepenthe would be able to keep up with that pace."
d_ex_gym_06_45,Oh... gotcha...
d_ex_gym_06_46,Are you okay?
d_ex_gym_06_47,Offer your hand to Quiry to pick her up.
d_ex_gym_06_48,"Thanks, Commander."
d_ex_gym_06_49,It'd be great if everything else in the world was as in focus as you are.
d_ex_gym_06_50,I can see the Commander clearly too!
d_ex_gym_06_51,*Sigh*
d_ex_gym_06_52,"You don't have to point out the obvious, Miranda."
d_ex_gym_06_53,"Anyway, how about we scrap cardio for now and move onto some strength training?"
d_ex_gym_06_54,We all head over to the dumbbells.
d_ex_gym_06_55,How does everyone feel about the shoulder press?
d_ex_gym_06_56,Are you saying shoulder presso? Never heard of it before. Is that a new kind of coffee?
d_ex_gym_06_57,It makes sense that you haven't heard of it before... considering that kind of coffee doesn't exist.
d_ex_gym_06_58,It's the name of an exercise.
d_ex_gym_06_59,It is?
d_ex_gym_06_60,*Sigh*
d_ex_gym_06_61,Is this how you do it?
d_ex_gym_06_62,"With one hand, Quiry clumsily lifts the heaviest dumbbell she could find."
d_ex_gym_06_63,Careful!
d_ex_gym_06_64,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_06_65,Ouch...
d_ex_gym_06_66,"Quiry, are you okay?"
d_ex_gym_06_67,I guess it's my turn now.
d_ex_gym_06_68,"No, don't!"
d_ex_gym_06_69,Our teamwork is beyond anything I imagined.
d_ex_gym_06_70,How about some simple bodyweight exercises?
d_ex_gym_06_71,Body weight exercises?
d_ex_gym_06_72,"Yeah. Quiry's eyesight won't be a detriment, and it'll be easier for us to all do it in unison."
d_ex_gym_06_73,That's a good idea!
d_ex_gym_06_74,I'm on board.
d_ex_gym_06_75,Are bodyweight exercises easier...?
d_ex_gym_06_76,"At the very least, nothing will collapse or fall over."
d_ex_gym_06_77,We proceed to start doing squats.
d_ex_gym_06_78,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_06_79,...
d_ex_gym_06_80,*Sigh*
d_ex_gym_06_81,Ouch...
d_ex_gym_06_82,I don't know where to stop!
d_ex_gym_06_83,That doesn't mean you should go all the way down until you fall over.
d_ex_gym_06_84,I can't see much of anything. Should I just follow Miranda?
d_ex_gym_06_85,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_06_86,Ow... my butt hurts.
d_ex_gym_06_87,"If you keep that up, of course it will!"
d_ex_gym_06_88,"Instead of Miranda, follow the Commander's lead."
d_ex_gym_06_89,...
d_ex_gym_06_90,I think I picked the wrong day to work out.
d_ex_police_06_title,Culprit's Whereabouts
d_ex_police_06_1,*Zing*
d_ex_police_06_2,Commander! We were waiting for you!
d_ex_police_06_3,I got here as fast as I could after receiving the call. What's wrong?
d_ex_police_06_4,"Allow me to explain, Watson."
d_ex_police_06_5,This case goes back about 20 minutes.
d_ex_police_06_6,I heard a report about a fence in the park that was damaged.
d_ex_police_06_7,"Hot on the trail, I found myself heading straight to the park."
d_ex_police_06_8,"The fence had been heavily vandalized. It was covered in bite marks, and Jackal was nearby."
d_ex_police_06_9,"Not only that, but my pen went missing."
d_ex_police_06_10,"So, the A.C.P.U. was dispatched, and we all gathered at the police station."
d_ex_police_06_11,"I'm not quite sure where your pen factors into all this, but I think I'm up to speed."
d_ex_police_06_12,Commander!
d_ex_police_06_13,Hurry up and let me out of here!
d_ex_police_06_14,Jackal leaps up and down inside the cell.
d_ex_police_06_15,"Jackal, you need to behave."
d_ex_police_06_16,"Quiry, you're talking to Novel."
d_ex_police_06_17,"Oh, whoops!"
d_ex_police_06_18,Sorry.
d_ex_police_06_19,So you haven't been able to identify who damaged the fence?
d_ex_police_06_20,"Oh no, we're quite certain the culprit is Jackal."
d_ex_police_06_21,She gave a confession and everything.
d_ex_police_06_22,Would you let me out here? I'm starving!
d_ex_police_06_23,"So, case closed?"
d_ex_police_06_24,Not quite.
d_ex_police_06_25,My pen is still MIA.
d_ex_police_06_26,"I always carry it around in my bag,"
d_ex_police_06_27,"but when I tried to look for it to write up my concluding report, it was nowhere to be found."
d_ex_police_06_28,We can't move on until that pen shows back up again.
d_ex_police_06_29,Is there a chance that you could have dropped it on the way here?
d_ex_police_06_30,Not a chance.
d_ex_police_06_31,"Before the pen went missing, I hadn't opened my bag even once."
d_ex_police_06_32,"Not only that, but at the very moment I discovered it had disappeared,"
d_ex_police_06_33,"I happened to be near the desecrated fence,"
d_ex_police_06_34,where Jackal was close by.
d_ex_police_06_35,I'm certain that Jackal is the one who took my pen!
d_ex_police_06_36,Is that pen edible?
d_ex_police_06_37,No.
d_ex_police_06_38,Growwwl...
d_ex_police_06_39,Then it wasn't me!
d_ex_police_06_40,That fence in the park wasn't edible either.
d_ex_police_06_41,You're telling me. It tasted terrible.
d_ex_police_06_42,...
d_ex_police_06_43,Should I go out searching for it?
d_ex_police_06_44,Just you?
d_ex_police_06_45,Sure!
d_ex_police_06_46,"You're the only one assigned to the station right now, so it'd probably be best for you to stay put."
d_ex_police_06_47,"Oh, good point."
d_ex_police_06_48,Then what's our next move?
d_ex_police_06_49,"Novel, what if Jackal ate the pen?"
d_ex_police_06_50,"If that is in fact what transpired, then there's nothing to do but get a new pen."
d_ex_police_06_51,Show Jackal one of the pens from the Police Station.
d_ex_police_06_52,What is this? Wonder how it tastes...
d_ex_police_06_53,*Crunch*
d_ex_police_06_54,Blech! It's horrible!
d_ex_police_06_55,I wouldn't eat this if you gave it to me for free!
d_ex_police_06_56,"Hm, maybe Jackal isn't the culprit after all."
d_ex_police_06_57,I better jot down what we know so far.
d_ex_police_06_58,"Quiry takes out her notebook and a pen, and holds the notebook close up to her nose to examine it."
d_ex_police_06_59,I always summarize my findings in this notebook.
d_ex_police_06_60,Let's see... the park fence was destroyed... next...
d_ex_police_06_61,!!
d_ex_police_06_62,That's my pen!
d_ex_police_06_63,!
d_ex_police_06_64,!
d_ex_police_06_65,!
d_ex_police_06_66,I'm huuuuungry!
d_ex_police_06_67,Where?
d_ex_police_06_68,Novel points to the pen Quiry is holding onto.
d_ex_police_06_69,Right there!
d_ex_police_06_70,Where?!
d_ex_police_06_71,Quiry looks around.
d_ex_police_06_72,"I believe it's the pen you're holding right now, Quiry."
d_ex_police_06_73,Huh?
d_ex_police_06_74,Wait a sec... this isn't the pen we typically use.
d_ex_police_06_75,We've got a new development:
d_ex_police_06_76,How on earth did my pen end up in your possession?
d_ex_police_06_77,Growwwl...
d_ex_police_06_78,"I'm telling you, let me out! Or else I'm gonna chew through these bars!"
d_ex_police_06_79,"You really mustn't do that, Jackal."
d_ex_police_06_80,"You're talking to a towel, Quiry."
d_ex_police_06_81,Whoops...
d_ex_police_06_82,"Anyway, we can work together now to crack this case."
d_ex_police_06_83,"You can join us as well, Watson."
d_ex_police_06_84,Growwl...
d_ex_police_06_85,Jackal starts to chew on the cell bars.
d_ex_police_06_86,I start to feel an overriding desire to go back to the Commander's Room.

d_ex_clothingstore_08_35,... A hair tie?

d_ex_redash_01_1_4,"It's a disease,"
d_ex_redash_01_1_5,and so we have to treat it.
d_ex_redash_01_1_6,"This isn't an everyday cold, you know."
d_ex_redash_01_1_7,You know more than anyone else
d_ex_redash_01_1_8,what I've been through.
d_ex_redash_01_1_9,I've been corrupted
d_ex_redash_01_1_10,by the Raptures.
d_ex_redash_01_1_11,I know. You don't have to remind me.
d_ex_redash_01_1_12,Then don't bother.
d_ex_redash_01_1_13,You know it doesn't work.
d_ex_redash_01_1_14,That's not for certain.
d_ex_redash_01_1_15,Just forget it.
d_ex_redash_01_1_16,I'd rather go out and die an honorable death on the field
d_ex_redash_01_1_17,than spend my days getting turned into a pincushion.
d_ex_redash_01_1_18,"You're free to go out and fight all you want,"
d_ex_redash_01_1_19,"but before you do, just let me draw some blood."
d_ex_redash_01_1_20,That's precisely what I don't want to do!
d_ex_redash_01_1_21,Why?
d_ex_redash_01_1_22,Are you scared of needles?
d_ex_redash_01_1_23,Hardy har. You know that's not it.
d_ex_redash_01_1_24,... Is it because it might confirm there's no antidote?
d_ex_redash_01_1_25,Are you so afraid that I might not find a cure?
d_ex_redash_01_1_26,...!
d_ex_redash_01_1_27,We haven't even tried yet.
d_ex_redash_01_1_28,The least we can do is try.
d_ex_redash_01_1_29,We have to do our best to fight this thing. We can beat it.
d_ex_redash_01_1_30,... Let's just stop talking about it.
d_ex_redash_01_1_31,"So you're going to throw your hands up and give up, is that it?"
d_ex_redash_01_1_32,Run away like a coward without even fighting?
d_ex_redash_01_1_33,Is that what you really want?
d_ex_redash_01_1_34,What else am I supposed to do?!
d_ex_redash_01_1_35,"Fine, let's say we go through with this."
d_ex_redash_01_1_36,What will it change?
d_ex_redash_01_1_37,Will it get rid of the corruption? Will it prolong my life?
d_ex_redash_01_1_38,It will change your mindset.
d_ex_redash_01_1_39,"You'll be putting your best foot forward, and you'll be less likely to give up."
d_ex_redash_01_1_40,You're not a lost cause.
d_ex_redash_01_1_41,You're surrounded by people who care about you.
d_ex_redash_01_1_42,You have to tell yourself that you want to live.
d_ex_redash_01_1_43,I'm begging you.
d_ex_redash_01_1_44,!!
d_ex_redash_01_1_45,"I'm asking you to trust me, just this once."
d_ex_redash_01_1_46,Give me a chance to try and cure you.
d_ex_redash_01_1_47,To do my best to fight against this corruption.
d_ex_redash_01_1_48,Can you give me that much?
d_ex_redash_01_1_49,... Rapunzel.
d_ex_redash_01_1_50,I can't just sit back and let this claim you.
d_ex_redash_01_1_51,I don't want to lose a colleague...
d_ex_redash_01_1_52,... and a friend.
d_ex_redash_01_1_53,...
d_ex_redash_01_1_54,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_01_1_55,I never thought I'd hear such things from someone who lived such a sheltered life.
d_ex_redash_01_1_56,"You're really laying it on thick, aren't you?"
d_ex_redash_01_1_57,"Well, I was a potential candidate to be the next pope, after all."
d_ex_redash_01_1_58,I've always had a proclivity for glibness.
d_ex_redash_01_1_59,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_01_1_60,... Fine. I suppose it'd be a bit disgraceful to give up without a fight.
d_ex_redash_01_1_61,"If you're that insistent,"
d_ex_redash_01_1_62,I'll give it a shot.
d_ex_redash_01_1_63,... Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_01_1_64,Red Hood extends her arm.
d_ex_redash_01_1_65,Take your damn blood.
d_ex_redash_01_1_66,Let's see what we're up against here.
d_ex_redash_01_1_67,... Thank you for putting your faith in me.
d_ex_redash_01_1_68,Ugh... so corny.
d_ex_redash_01_1_69,Give it a rest and take the blood sample already.
d_ex_redash_01_1_70,Red Hood rolls up her sleeve and extends her arm out once again.
d_ex_redash_01_1_71,Okay.
d_ex_redash_01_1_72,Then thank...
d_ex_redash_01_1_73,*Stick*
d_ex_redash_01_1_74,Rapunzel sticks the needle into Red Hood's arm mid-sentence.
d_ex_redash_01_1_75,Argh!
d_ex_redash_01_1_76,You didn't say it'd hurt!
d_ex_redash_01_1_77,Don't be such a crybaby.
d_ex_redash_01_1_78,This is a perfectly normal shot.
d_ex_redash_01_1_79,"Normal, my ass! Are you sure you stuck me properly?"
d_ex_redash_01_1_80,Of course I did!
d_ex_redash_01_1_81,At least it felt right when it went in...
d_ex_redash_01_1_82,It hurts like hell! How many more of these do we have to do?
d_ex_redash_01_1_83,Let's see... 7 more to go.
d_ex_redash_01_1_84,What?!
d_ex_redash_01_1_85,"That's it, I'm done!"

d_ex_redash_01_2_2,Rapunzel hands a vial of green liquid to Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_01_2_3,What is this toxic-looking sludge?
d_ex_redash_01_2_4,It doesn't even look edible.
d_ex_redash_01_2_5,It's medicine.
d_ex_redash_01_2_6,Medicine?
d_ex_redash_01_2_7,For who?
d_ex_redash_01_2_8,Who do you think?
d_ex_redash_01_2_9,Don't tell me that this is the cure?
d_ex_redash_01_2_10,That's right.
d_ex_redash_01_2_11,"Based on the data we've compiled,"
d_ex_redash_01_2_12,"and from analyzing the blood that we drew from you,"
d_ex_redash_01_2_13,I've formulated a preliminary antidote.
d_ex_redash_01_2_14,You've already come up with a prototype?
d_ex_redash_01_2_15,You're even more skilled than I thought!
d_ex_redash_01_2_16,I'm not the one who made it.
d_ex_redash_01_2_17,We have V.T.C. to thank for that.
d_ex_redash_01_2_18,My role was simply to analyze the data and hand it to V.T.C.
d_ex_redash_01_2_19,"Hey now, don't shortchange yourself. That's still super impressive."
d_ex_redash_01_2_20,I'm starting to feel spoiled with you looking after me so much.
d_ex_redash_01_2_21,Stop babbling and try it.
d_ex_redash_01_2_22,I'm supposed to observe your reaction and give V.T.C. a status report.
d_ex_redash_01_2_23,"All right, down the hatch then."
d_ex_redash_01_2_24,Red Hood takes the green liquid from Rapunzel.
d_ex_redash_01_2_25,...
d_ex_redash_01_2_26,??
d_ex_redash_01_2_27,Er...
d_ex_redash_01_2_28,Hmm...
d_ex_redash_01_2_29,Why aren't you drinking it?
d_ex_redash_01_2_30,Well...
d_ex_redash_01_2_31,It's just... it looks absolutely disgusting.
d_ex_redash_01_2_32,Medicine isn't supposed to taste good.
d_ex_redash_01_2_33,I was actually thinking about this recently.
d_ex_redash_01_2_34,"If they can make all this medication that treats previously incurable diseases, how come they can't make some that taste half decent?"
d_ex_redash_01_2_35,...
d_ex_redash_01_2_36,Do they intentionally make them taste bad to torture us?
d_ex_redash_01_2_37,Wha...
d_ex_redash_01_2_38,"Honestly, I'd swear they derive some kind of sick pleasure from watching people suffer."
d_ex_redash_01_2_39,What?!
d_ex_redash_01_2_40,That's absurd! Why would we force people to do such a thing?
d_ex_redash_01_2_41,I didn't say anything about force-feeding. That's on you.
d_ex_redash_01_2_42,Stop kidding around and drink it already!
d_ex_redash_01_2_43,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_01_2_44,Oof... I'm really not digging this color.
d_ex_redash_01_2_45,*Sniff sniff*
d_ex_redash_01_2_46,Ugh!
d_ex_redash_01_2_47,It reeks too!
d_ex_redash_01_2_48,Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_01_2_49,"Okay, fine. I'll drink it."
d_ex_redash_01_2_50,Here we go...
d_ex_redash_01_2_51,Red Hood downs the green liquid all in one go.
d_ex_redash_01_2_52,*Gulp*
d_ex_redash_01_2_53,Good lord!
d_ex_redash_01_2_54,What is this?! It tastes like mop water that's been left in the sun.
d_ex_redash_01_2_55,How would you even know what that tastes like...
d_ex_redash_01_2_56,Urgh... I think I'm gonna barf.
d_ex_redash_01_2_57,"Other than nauseous, how are you feeling?"
d_ex_redash_01_2_58,Any dizziness or fever?
d_ex_redash_01_2_59,Do your hands or legs feel numb?
d_ex_redash_01_2_60,If you are asking...
d_ex_redash_01_2_61,Hmmm...
d_ex_redash_01_2_62,I'm not really sure.
d_ex_redash_01_2_63,But I really do think it's going to happen.
d_ex_redash_01_2_64,What?
d_ex_redash_01_2_65,I'm gonna vomit.
d_ex_redash_01_2_66,?!
d_ex_redash_01_2_67,"N-no, don't! If you do, you'll need to drink it all over again!"
d_ex_redash_01_2_68,Blurgh...

d_ex_redash_01_3_2,"I don't know when it started,"
d_ex_redash_01_3_3,but Saintess stopped looking me in the eye.
d_ex_redash_01_3_4,More medicine?
d_ex_redash_01_3_5,Huh?
d_ex_redash_01_3_6,What are you so startled for?
d_ex_redash_01_3_7,I'm asking if I have to take more medicine.
d_ex_redash_01_3_8,Oh... yes. Yes.
d_ex_redash_01_3_9,...
d_ex_redash_01_3_10,"Come to think of it, you stopped taking blood samples."
d_ex_redash_01_3_11,You couldn't get enough of them before.
d_ex_redash_01_3_12,That... that's because I know how painful it is for you when I do them.
d_ex_redash_01_3_13,Are you sure it's not because
d_ex_redash_01_3_14,you don't need my data anymore?
d_ex_redash_01_3_15,!!
d_ex_redash_01_3_16,N-no!
d_ex_redash_01_3_17,Of course we need it.
d_ex_redash_01_3_18,"I just wanted to give you a little break from it,"
d_ex_redash_01_3_19,that's all.
d_ex_redash_01_3_20,Even now...
d_ex_redash_01_3_21,Is V.T.C. making any progress?
d_ex_redash_01_3_22,Hmm?
d_ex_redash_01_3_23,"Well, they're continuing their research on the treatment, but..."
d_ex_redash_01_3_24,progress has been slow...
d_ex_redash_01_3_25,She can't look me in the eye.
d_ex_redash_01_3_26,...
d_ex_redash_01_3_27,Saintess.
d_ex_redash_01_3_28,This medicine...
d_ex_redash_01_3_29,Yes?
d_ex_redash_01_3_30,Is it really a treatment for corruption?
d_ex_redash_01_3_31,...
d_ex_redash_01_3_32,"Lately, it tastes more like vitamins than anything else."
d_ex_redash_01_3_33,Is there something wrong with the medicine?
d_ex_redash_01_3_34,"There have also been whole stacks of research papers on her desk,"
d_ex_redash_01_3_35,Is the smell bothering you again?
d_ex_redash_01_3_36,and she hasn't mentioned anything new about the development of an antidote.
d_ex_redash_01_3_37,I've tried to make it less offensive than before...
d_ex_redash_01_3_38,I can see the hope fading from her eyes.
d_ex_redash_01_3_39,... Rapunzel.
d_ex_redash_01_3_40,Huh?
d_ex_redash_01_3_41,Am I going to make it?
d_ex_redash_01_3_42,Wh-why are you using my real name?
d_ex_redash_01_3_43,Can you still say
d_ex_redash_01_3_44,that this corruption is treatable?
d_ex_redash_01_3_45,Red Hood?
d_ex_redash_01_3_46,It's nothing.
d_ex_redash_01_3_47,I just haven't called you by your name in a long time.
d_ex_redash_01_3_48,This medicine is still hideous looking.
d_ex_redash_01_3_49,Shouldn't they have been able to find a way to make it easier on the eyes by now?
d_ex_redash_01_3_50,...
d_ex_redash_01_3_51,Her hands are trembling ever so slightly.
d_ex_redash_01_3_52,She gazes at me anxiously.
d_ex_redash_01_3_53,The corner of her mouth furrows hesitantly.
d_ex_redash_01_3_54,The air is filled with a sense of regret and sorrow.
d_ex_redash_01_3_55,I already know the answer.
d_ex_redash_01_3_56,It's not possible.
d_ex_redash_01_3_57,Things haven't felt right
d_ex_redash_01_3_58,for a while now.
d_ex_redash_01_3_59,There's no cure.
d_ex_redash_01_3_60,What are you saying?
d_ex_redash_01_3_61,I guess I don't have much of a choice.
d_ex_redash_01_3_62,"Hehe, another day..."
d_ex_redash_01_3_63,and another dose of this disgusting medicine.

d_ex_redash_02_1_8,With that sword?
d_ex_redash_02_1_9,"No thanks. I'm not in the mood, and I don't want to get my clothes dirty."
d_ex_redash_02_1_10,I've been trying hard to keep them clean for the past few days.
d_ex_redash_02_1_11,Even better.
d_ex_redash_02_1_12,I shall see to it that your garments are soiled through and through.
d_ex_redash_02_1_13,Have you ever listened to yourself speak? You sound uncouth and uneducated.
d_ex_redash_02_1_14,"Since thou dost accuse me of these crimes every day, 'tis only appropriate for me to act the part."
d_ex_redash_02_1_15,"Whenever Scarlet and Dorothy meet,"
d_ex_redash_02_1_16,they are immediately at each other's throats like two wild dogs.
d_ex_redash_02_1_17,There are few words in the English language that can accurately describe the animosity between these two.
d_ex_redash_02_1_18,Try and block this.

d_ex_redash_02_1_29,Regardless!
d_ex_redash_02_1_30,I'm getting tired of having to clean up after you two every time you get into a tussle.
d_ex_redash_02_1_31,"Oh, so it's you who's always cleaning up the mess?"
d_ex_redash_02_1_32,I was wondering.
d_ex_redash_02_1_33,"Forsooth, I believed twas Dorothy, for she is so obsessed with cleanliness."
d_ex_redash_02_1_34,So you've been pawning off your responsibilities to Snow White?
d_ex_redash_02_1_35,Give me a break.
d_ex_redash_02_1_36,I did no such thing.
d_ex_redash_02_1_37,"Moreover,"
d_ex_redash_02_1_38,you never even considered cleaning up after yourself for a single second.
d_ex_redash_02_1_39,Steady thy tongue.
d_ex_redash_02_1_40,"So long as what I require is within reach, tis enough for mine sensibilities."
d_ex_redash_02_1_41,What need is there to spend time frivolously faffing about with this and that?
d_ex_redash_02_1_42,"You're a real slob, you know what?"
d_ex_redash_02_1_43,What did you call me?
d_ex_redash_02_1_44,"This impertinent tongue waggling against me is because ye have little notion of what a true ""slob"" actually constitutes."
d_ex_redash_02_1_45,Scarlet! Dorothy!
d_ex_redash_02_1_46,Would you two please cut it out?

d_ex_redash_02_2_7,"I've done all I can to try and keep them apart,"

d_ex_redash_02_2_9,I'm sorry.
d_ex_redash_02_2_10,Why are you apologizing?
d_ex_redash_02_2_11,They're the ones responsible for this.
d_ex_redash_02_2_12,Where are they now?

d_ex_redash_02_2_19,utterly lacking in all etiquette.
d_ex_redash_02_2_20,A total brute who is always spoiling for a fight.
d_ex_redash_02_2_21,"She insists on sparring with me, even when she can't win."
d_ex_redash_02_2_22,"Not to mention how she never cleans up after herself,"
d_ex_redash_02_2_23,and her room has all those animal pelts lying around everywhere.

d_ex_redash_02_2_31,Meanwhile.
d_ex_redash_02_2_32,...
d_ex_redash_02_2_33,"Such bluster, such haughtiness she has. I failed in taking the wind from her sails."
d_ex_redash_02_2_34,Tis rather peculiar.
d_ex_redash_02_2_35,"I was convinced I could break her, given her fixation on cleanliness."
d_ex_redash_02_2_36,I hardly expected our skirmish to last for so long.
d_ex_redash_02_2_37,Hmm...

d_ex_redash_02_2_41,"And perhaps most egregiously of all, she looked down upon the path of the sword."
d_ex_redash_02_2_42,"I will break her yet, and I will do so through direct confrontation."
d_ex_redash_02_2_43,"Yes, I will make it so."
d_ex_redash_02_2_44,...
d_ex_redash_02_2_45,"But first, before that,"
d_ex_redash_02_2_46,I believe I must convalesce for a moment...

d_ex_redash_02_3_3,Dorothy is heading to her favorite place
d_ex_redash_02_3_4,where she always takes her afternoon tea.
d_ex_redash_02_3_5,A place with breathtaking scenery and where gorgeous flowers abound.
d_ex_redash_02_3_6,A place she can call home.
d_ex_redash_02_3_7,But...
d_ex_redash_02_3_8,!
d_ex_redash_02_3_9,Hmm?
d_ex_redash_02_3_10,"Pray tell, what brings thee here of all places?"
d_ex_redash_02_3_11,I was about to ask you
d_ex_redash_02_3_12,the very same thing.
d_ex_redash_02_3_13,This is where I always drink my...
d_ex_redash_02_3_14,...
d_ex_redash_02_3_15,"Not wanting to reveal how much this place means to her,"
d_ex_redash_02_3_16,Dorothy stops herself.
d_ex_redash_02_3_17,"Instead, she fixates her gaze on a certain something in Scarlet's hands."
d_ex_redash_02_3_18,What are you drinking?
d_ex_redash_02_3_19,"Oh, this?"
d_ex_redash_02_3_20,Some floral tea.
d_ex_redash_02_3_21,"The scenery here is rather breathtaking, so I venture here from time to time to enjoy a cup of tea."
d_ex_redash_02_3_22,...
d_ex_redash_02_3_23,You're telling me you drink floral tea?
d_ex_redash_02_3_24,Doth my words fall on deaf ears?
d_ex_redash_02_3_25,Would you perchance like to try? 'Tis made from goldenrod.
d_ex_redash_02_3_26,"Scarlet hands the cup over to Dorothy, who hesitates for a moment after receiving it."
d_ex_redash_02_3_27,"The aroma is undeniably alluring, however, and she finds herself almost subconsciously taking a sip."
d_ex_redash_02_3_28,Mmm?
d_ex_redash_02_3_29,This is Marigold.
d_ex_redash_02_3_30,The sweet aftertaste is divine.
d_ex_redash_02_3_31,Where did you get this?
d_ex_redash_02_3_32,I brewed it myself.
d_ex_redash_02_3_33,What?
d_ex_redash_02_3_34,You brewed this tea?
d_ex_redash_02_3_35,The entire thing? All by yourself?
d_ex_redash_02_3_36,"I beg thee, avert thy gaze."
d_ex_redash_02_3_37,Do not regard me as if I were a freak of nature.
d_ex_redash_02_3_38,My interest in herbal tea is long-established.
d_ex_redash_02_3_39,Many horticultural samples are festooned around my chambers. Have you not seen them?
d_ex_redash_02_3_40,No. I've never been able to get past all the animal skins.
d_ex_redash_02_3_41,The flowers are most diminutive. Perhaps that explains why thine eyes did not chance upon them.
d_ex_redash_02_3_42,"At any rate, to be able to recognize which strain thou art imbibing from merely one sip is impressive."
d_ex_redash_02_3_43,It doth seem thou art most erudite on the subject of tea.
d_ex_redash_02_3_44,"Well, if I'm being honest,"
d_ex_redash_02_3_45,this is a place I come often to enjoy a cup of tea.
d_ex_redash_02_3_46,"Oh, just like me."
d_ex_redash_02_3_47,You have good taste.
d_ex_redash_02_3_48,Well... in that regard at least... I suppose you do as well.
d_ex_redash_02_3_49,"And I must admit,"
d_ex_redash_02_3_50,this tea is superb.

d_ex_redash_02_3_56,Ye are more than welcome to come and partake along with me.
d_ex_redash_02_3_57,I'll think about it.
d_ex_redash_02_3_58,*Shaaaaaaaa*
d_ex_redash_02_3_59,"Might I ask, why thou dost hold the cup in such a peculiar fashion?"
d_ex_redash_02_3_60,What do you mean?
d_ex_redash_02_3_61,Thy pinky is protruding outwards when you take a sip.
d_ex_redash_02_3_62,Perhaps thy digit is afflicted with an ailment of some sort?
d_ex_redash_02_3_63,You pay attention to the smallest things.
d_ex_redash_02_3_64,"Call me crazy, but I've felt for some time now that you are particularly interested in me."
d_ex_redash_02_3_65,Interest?
d_ex_redash_02_3_66,"Forsooth, perhaps thou could say so."
d_ex_redash_02_3_67,Perseverance ensures success.
d_ex_redash_02_3_68,Huh?
d_ex_redash_02_3_69,It is as thou hast claimed. I have always been observing you.
d_ex_redash_02_3_70,So you've been stalking me?! In what world is that acceptable behavior?
d_ex_redash_02_3_71,We both have finished our tea. Let us go for another round.
d_ex_redash_02_3_72,No. I don't want to get my clothes dirty.
d_ex_redash_02_3_73,They are already soiled as is. A bit more grime would be of nugatory importance.
d_ex_redash_02_3_74,I really can't stand you.
d_ex_redash_02_3_75,"Hmm? Where are thou going, Dorothy?"
d_ex_redash_02_3_76,Dost thou retreat from me?

d_ex_redash_03_1_3,Looking forward to working with you all.
d_ex_redash_03_1_4,"Wow, someone else finally passed."
d_ex_redash_03_1_5,Turns out there actually are people compatible with the program.
d_ex_redash_03_1_6,"You... are a Nikke, aren't you?"
d_ex_redash_03_1_7,"I am, correct."
d_ex_redash_03_1_8,"From the outside, you're indistinguishable from a real human."
d_ex_redash_03_1_9,"Hey, aren't I a Nikke too?"
d_ex_redash_03_1_10,"Sure, but your appearance is slightly different from a human's."
d_ex_redash_03_1_11,Huh? How?
d_ex_redash_03_1_12,Mecha Dessssstructerrr!!
d_ex_redash_03_1_13,My apologies for the Commander's behavior. He sometimes goes on these nonsensical tangents.
d_ex_redash_03_1_14,"Jeez, it feels like you tore my arm out of the socket."
d_ex_redash_03_1_15,"You're fine, don't worry."
d_ex_redash_03_1_16,This... isn't quite what I imagined it would be.
d_ex_redash_03_1_17,What isn't?
d_ex_redash_03_1_18,"I thought everything would have a bit more of a... refined air to it. More noble, perhaps?"
d_ex_redash_03_1_19,Especially considering we're the last line of defense between mankind and complete annihilation.
d_ex_redash_03_1_20,Are you somehow implying that we're crass?
d_ex_redash_03_1_21,"No, I didn't mean that."
d_ex_redash_03_1_22,I just didn't expect you all to be so laid back.
d_ex_redash_03_1_23,"We get our fair share of tension on the battlefield, so we have to make the most of whatever fun we can have."
d_ex_redash_03_1_24,Did you say your name was Dorothy?
d_ex_redash_03_1_25,Yes.
d_ex_redash_03_1_26,What's your battle experience?
d_ex_redash_03_1_27,None.
d_ex_redash_03_1_28,Have you ever fired a weapon?
d_ex_redash_03_1_29,Negative.
d_ex_redash_03_1_30,Not even in a simulation?
d_ex_redash_03_1_31,No.
d_ex_redash_03_1_32,How in the world are we going to find a use for you...
d_ex_redash_03_1_33,"I can be of use, I assure you. I have everything I need to know up here, in my head."
d_ex_redash_03_1_34,"Ah, so you're another one of those types."
d_ex_redash_03_1_35,"In lieu of practical experience, you've got an all-compassing knowledge of various theories and stratagems, and so you believe you can be deployed straight away."
d_ex_redash_03_1_36,You know what all these kinds of people have in common?
d_ex_redash_03_1_37,They get killed.
d_ex_redash_03_1_38,Sucks for them.
d_ex_redash_03_1_39,Are you even listening to what I'm saying?
d_ex_redash_03_1_40,"Dorothy, at this point,"
d_ex_redash_03_1_41,"we can't put much faith in your professed skills,"
d_ex_redash_03_1_42,"so, if it's okay with you, I'd like to conduct a test."
d_ex_redash_03_1_43,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_44,"If I'm being honest, I'm a bit offended. I realize we've only just met, but to say that you don't trust me straight to my face?"
d_ex_redash_03_1_45,We just don't want any of our members getting killed.
d_ex_redash_03_1_46,"So if you think someone won't last long on the field, you won't accept them to begin with?"
d_ex_redash_03_1_47,"It might sound harsh, but yes."
d_ex_redash_03_1_48,"It's up to you. You can refuse the test, but if you do, you won't be able to join the team."
d_ex_redash_03_1_49,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_50,Let's get this over with.
d_ex_redash_03_1_51,One hour later.
d_ex_redash_03_1_52,Are we done?
d_ex_redash_03_1_53,Any other tests?
d_ex_redash_03_1_54,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_55,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_56,Were the results no good?
d_ex_redash_03_1_57,"I personally thought I did well, but maybe I didn't meet your standards..."
d_ex_redash_03_1_58,"Welcome to the Goddess Squad, Dorothy."
d_ex_redash_03_1_59,You did amazing. I think you even broke a few records. Are you sure you're new to all this?
d_ex_redash_03_1_60,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_61,"All right, it's party time!"
d_ex_redash_03_1_62,"We were given an allowance to hold some festivities, but were told we couldn't spend it all between just the two of us. If we don't use it by tomorrow, we'll have to return the funds."
d_ex_redash_03_1_63,"Finally, we got to have a party!"
d_ex_redash_03_1_64,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_65,Sounds fun.
d_ex_redash_03_1_66,"Ah, there is something I'd like to ask you, just for the record."
d_ex_redash_03_1_67,Go ahead.
d_ex_redash_03_1_68,What was your reason for becoming a Nikke?
d_ex_redash_03_1_69,...
d_ex_redash_03_1_70,I wanted to go back. To the past.
d_ex_redash_03_1_71,"If I defeat all of these infernal creatures, I believe things can go back to how they used to be."
d_ex_redash_03_1_72,Hmm. Okay. I understand.
d_ex_redash_03_1_73,You can't go back to the past.
d_ex_redash_03_1_74,Commander!
d_ex_redash_03_1_75,"No matter what the outcome of this battle is, the past that you're longing for is gone."
d_ex_redash_03_1_76,However.
d_ex_redash_03_1_77,You can unleash your frustrations
d_ex_redash_03_1_78,on those things that ruined your life and made it part of a past that can never be reclaimed.

d_ex_redash_03_2_4,... What exactly are you?
d_ex_redash_03_2_5,She looks like a nun.
d_ex_redash_03_2_6,Is that what you are?
d_ex_redash_03_2_7,Yes.
d_ex_redash_03_2_8,Where did you say you came from?
d_ex_redash_03_2_9,I'm from V.T.C.
d_ex_redash_03_2_10,"When you say V.T.C., do you mean the medical center operated by the church group?"
d_ex_redash_03_2_11,Yes. That's correct.
d_ex_redash_03_2_12,"Now that I think about it, your face looks kind of familiar."
d_ex_redash_03_2_13,Weren't you the leading candidate to assume the papacy?
d_ex_redash_03_2_14,I left all that behind.
d_ex_redash_03_2_15,Why? You had such a bright future ahead of you.
d_ex_redash_03_2_16,I couldn't bear to sit back watching all the suffering in this world and not do anything about it.
d_ex_redash_03_2_17,"Yet, despite my desire to stand up and do something, I found myself in an environment where human dignity had perished, and base survival was the driving force behind all decisions. I was powerless to do anything."
d_ex_redash_03_2_18,That's when I heard about all of you.
d_ex_redash_03_2_19,Stories circulated about how you all were a beacon of light bringing hope back into the world.
d_ex_redash_03_2_20,I wanted to be part of that.
d_ex_redash_03_2_21,That's why I'm here. I wish to become a Goddess of Victory.
d_ex_redash_03_2_22,Faith alone will not get us through this trial. The time has come for us to take up arms.
d_ex_redash_03_2_23,That is why I was determined to be eligible for this program.
d_ex_redash_03_2_24,You speak like a Saint.
d_ex_redash_03_2_25,Truly.
d_ex_redash_03_2_26,A holy warrior.
d_ex_redash_03_2_27,I'm looking forward to working with all of you.
d_ex_redash_03_2_28,As are we.
d_ex_redash_03_2_29,May I ask what kind of skills you have?
d_ex_redash_03_2_30,"Ah, yes."
d_ex_redash_03_2_31,"I'm quite adept at praying. Once, I prayed continuously for three entire days without any rest."
d_ex_redash_03_2_32,I've also garnered praise for my preaching and public speaking engagements.
d_ex_redash_03_2_33,I even participated in the church choir.
d_ex_redash_03_2_34,Er...
d_ex_redash_03_2_35,I was referring more to your skills in battle.
d_ex_redash_03_2_36,"Oh, my apologies."
d_ex_redash_03_2_37,The staff that I use has the power to regenerate Goddesium.
d_ex_redash_03_2_38,Goddesium?
d_ex_redash_03_2_39,Remind me what that is again?
d_ex_redash_03_2_40,It's what our bodies are all composed of.
d_ex_redash_03_2_41,I knew that! I was just testing to make sure you knew.
d_ex_redash_03_2_42,Sure you were.
d_ex_redash_03_2_43,"Anyway, how is regenerating Goddesium out of thin air even possible?"
d_ex_redash_03_2_44,"To be more precise, I can replenish small amounts of Goddesium particles in damaged areas."
d_ex_redash_03_2_45,"For example,"
d_ex_redash_03_2_46,I would be able to undo the damage done by a gunshot.
d_ex_redash_03_2_47,So it's like filling up a hole? Wouldn't that negatively affect certain functions?
d_ex_redash_03_2_48,Not at all. I'm well versed in our internal structures.
d_ex_redash_03_2_49,This knowledge was imparted to me during the process of becoming a Nikke.
d_ex_redash_03_2_50,I therefore know precisely what each individual part of our body requires in order to function normally.
d_ex_redash_03_2_51,So you're a healer as well?
d_ex_redash_03_2_52,A woman of many talents.
d_ex_redash_03_2_53,Indeed.
d_ex_redash_03_2_54,"So long as we've got you on our team, we can fight without a care in the world."
d_ex_redash_03_2_55,"I would still urge you all to exercise caution in battle. I can heal certain injuries up to a point, but if the wounds are too severe, my powers won't be of much use."
d_ex_redash_03_2_56,"I also have a beam distortion ability, and my hair also acts as a scrambler for certain electronics."
d_ex_redash_03_2_57,"Although my physical prowess may not measure up to the rest of you,"
d_ex_redash_03_2_58,I'll be able to provide you with adequate support and allow you to focus on the fight.
d_ex_redash_03_2_59,Are you able to heal humans as well?
d_ex_redash_03_2_60,I'm afraid not.
d_ex_redash_03_2_61,Oh. That's too bad.
d_ex_redash_03_2_62,Why do you ask?
d_ex_redash_03_2_63,The commander is the one who's always getting hurt.
d_ex_redash_03_2_64,...
d_ex_redash_03_2_65,"Humans are such frail creatures, so I find it mystifying why he insists on standing at the very front in battle."
d_ex_redash_03_2_66,"Hey, I'm nothing to sneeze at! It's just that you all are so freakishly strong."
d_ex_redash_03_2_67,"Anyway, once you get unpacked,"
d_ex_redash_03_2_68,I'll give you a tour of the airship's interior.
d_ex_redash_03_2_69,"Wait, did you not bring any luggage with you?"
d_ex_redash_03_2_70,"No, I brought a few th..."
d_ex_redash_03_2_71,Wait...
d_ex_redash_03_2_72,...
d_ex_redash_03_2_73,"Oh dear. I was in such a rush, that I must have forgotten to bring my things."
d_ex_redash_03_2_74,What should I do now?
d_ex_redash_03_2_75,We're quite a ways away from V.T.C...
d_ex_redash_03_2_76,"They don't deliver here, do they?"
d_ex_redash_03_2_77,"She's a bit absent-minded, that's for sure."

d_ex_redash_03_3_6,All of our weapons are malfunctioning.
d_ex_redash_03_3_7,"My scrambler isn't working either, nor is my staff."
d_ex_redash_03_3_8,This is bad...
d_ex_redash_03_3_9,We'll have to take the fight close to them.
d_ex_redash_03_3_10,"Stay behind us, Commander."
d_ex_redash_03_3_11,"We're about to engage in close-quarters combat, and we won't be able to protect you."
d_ex_redash_03_3_12,"Have you all gone mad? You're all specialized in firearms, not CQC. I'm ordering a retreat."
d_ex_redash_03_3_13,But if we're unable to defend this place...
d_ex_redash_03_3_14,I know. We'll lose one of our biggest weapons depositories.
d_ex_redash_03_3_15,But none of our assets here are even close to being as valuable as you all are.
d_ex_redash_03_3_16,"Losing you would be a far more devastating blow. So, I'm telling you, retreat."
d_ex_redash_03_3_17,"... Everyone, prepare to retreat."
d_ex_redash_03_3_18,E-excuse me! Can I check the weapons real quick?
d_ex_redash_03_3_19,What's a kid doing in a place like this?
d_ex_redash_03_3_20,Who are you?
d_ex_redash_03_3_21,"I-I'm Snow White, Grimms Model No. 4."
d_ex_redash_03_3_22,"I wanted to give a proper self-introduction, but considering how desperate the situation is, we'll have to skip the formalities for the moment."
d_ex_redash_03_3_23,!!
d_ex_redash_03_3_24,Snow White!
d_ex_redash_03_3_25,"There's no time. Hand over your weapons to me, and I'll fix them."
d_ex_redash_03_3_26,"No, we have to retreat."
d_ex_redash_03_3_27,We've got to fall back.
d_ex_redash_03_3_28,Just give me a minute! I can fix it!
d_ex_redash_03_3_29,"Liliweiss, can you hold out for one more minute?"
d_ex_redash_03_3_30,For Snow White? Of course I can.
d_ex_redash_03_3_31,"You heard that, Snow White. You've got one minute."
d_ex_redash_03_3_32,Understood!
d_ex_redash_03_3_33,A moment later.
d_ex_redash_03_3_34,All clear.
d_ex_redash_03_3_35,"Nicely done, everyone."
d_ex_redash_03_3_36,Good job.
d_ex_redash_03_3_37,Phew... that got a bit hairy.
d_ex_redash_03_3_38,...
d_ex_redash_03_3_39,You said your name was Snow White?
d_ex_redash_03_3_40,Yes.
d_ex_redash_03_3_41,Thank you. You really saved our skins back there.
d_ex_redash_03_3_42,D-don't mention it.
d_ex_redash_03_3_43,How did you do that? You repaired all our weapons in one minute flat.
d_ex_redash_03_3_44,Maybe she just blew some air into the chambers?
d_ex_redash_03_3_45,"Yes... I mean, no!"
d_ex_redash_03_3_46,It wasn't that simple.
d_ex_redash_03_3_47,"Commander, for goodness' sake..."
d_ex_redash_03_3_48,What? It was just a little joke.
d_ex_redash_03_3_49,Look at her. She's practically a child.
d_ex_redash_03_3_50,"Okay, okay. Sorry."
d_ex_redash_03_3_51,"No, it's okay."
d_ex_redash_03_3_52,Liliweiss pats Snow White on the shoulder.
d_ex_redash_03_3_53,Thanks for saving us.
d_ex_redash_03_3_54,"I'm just glad that you're safe, Lilith."
d_ex_redash_03_3_55,You two know each other?
d_ex_redash_03_3_56,"Hehe, yeah. We've met before."
d_ex_redash_03_3_57,??
d_ex_redash_03_3_58,??
d_ex_redash_03_3_59,"As soon as my transformation was complete, I was assigned to the Goddess Squad."
d_ex_redash_03_3_60,"But I wasn't confident enough,"
d_ex_redash_03_3_61,so I stayed shut in my room and focused only on crafting weapons.
d_ex_redash_03_3_62,"Eventually though, Lilith helped get me out of my shell, and I mustered up the courage to join your squad properly."
d_ex_redash_03_3_63,I'm glad to finally be a part of the team.
d_ex_redash_03_3_64,"If your weapon is ever damaged or if you want to upgrade it, just give Snow White a ring."
d_ex_redash_03_3_65,"As you can see, she's a real prodigy when it comes to weapons."
d_ex_redash_03_3_66,Oh jeez... it's embarrassing when you put it like that...
d_ex_redash_03_3_67,...

d_ex_redash_03_4_3,"Hmm? Did you order something, Commander?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_4,No.
d_ex_redash_03_4_5,It looks to me like there could be a person inside.
d_ex_redash_03_4_6,Should we open it?
d_ex_redash_03_4_7,Absolutely not. What if it's been rigged with explosives?
d_ex_redash_03_4_8,"Even if that ends up being true, you'd be the one in danger, not us."
d_ex_redash_03_4_9,... Then can someone stand in front of me?
d_ex_redash_03_4_10,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_11,What? What's so wrong about me valuing my own life?
d_ex_redash_03_4_12,"There's nothing wrong with it, it's just... you don't exactly instill confidence when you say things like that."
d_ex_redash_03_4_13,Who cares about making others feel good when your own life is at stake?!
d_ex_redash_03_4_14,"Fine. Rapunzel, you come to stand in front of me. And be sure to turn on that scrambler of yours."
d_ex_redash_03_4_15,... Very well.
d_ex_redash_03_4_16,"Where is Snow White, by the way?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_17,"She's in the workshop. Apparently, she had something urgent she needed to take care of."
d_ex_redash_03_4_18,Running away from danger... such cowardice.
d_ex_redash_03_4_19,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_03_4_20,"Should I open it, then?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_21,"Wait, let me catch my breath first."

d_ex_redash_03_4_28,Nothing's happening.
d_ex_redash_03_4_29,S-surprise!
d_ex_redash_03_4_30,Ow... my legs've fallen asleep...
d_ex_redash_03_4_31,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_32,What in the world...?
d_ex_redash_03_4_33,How in the world did my legs fall asleep? I'm a Nikke...
d_ex_redash_03_4_34,Who are you?
d_ex_redash_03_4_35,"Give me a second, will ya? Let me stretch my legs first."
d_ex_redash_03_4_36,Red Hood struggles to stand up.
d_ex_redash_03_4_37,Oof...
d_ex_redash_03_4_38,"Phew, that's better."
d_ex_redash_03_4_39,"Commander, I think this is..."
d_ex_redash_03_4_40,Yes. I believe she's our new member who's supposed to arrive today.
d_ex_redash_03_4_41,"Ah, so you all are the Goddess Squad?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_42,The name's Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_03_4_43,Any chance any of you like old music?
d_ex_redash_03_4_44,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_45,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_46,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_47,...
d_ex_redash_03_4_48,No one? Then get a load of this. One listen and you'll never be able to get enough.
d_ex_redash_03_4_49,"Who did you say you were, again?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_50,Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_03_4_51,I've been assigned to the Goddess Squad.
d_ex_redash_03_4_52,"I think they said I was the Grimms Model No. 5, or something like that."
d_ex_redash_03_4_53,"If you ask me though,"
d_ex_redash_03_4_54,I should clearly be number one.
d_ex_redash_03_4_55,... Could you perhaps explain what you were doing in that box?
d_ex_redash_03_4_56,"Well, it'd be a bit boring if I just walked in, wouldn't it?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_57,"I wanted to give you all a little surprise, but you all sure took your sweet time."
d_ex_redash_03_4_58,"It's good to be cautious, but you should have a little consideration for the person stuffed inside the box."
d_ex_redash_03_4_59,... I don't think many people tend to think that way.
d_ex_redash_03_4_60,*Tap*
d_ex_redash_03_4_61,Red Hood clambers out of the box.
d_ex_redash_03_4_62,So you all live in this airship? The views are to die for.
d_ex_redash_03_4_63,Bit stuffy in here though. Can I crack open a window?
d_ex_redash_03_4_64,I don't think that's a good idea.
d_ex_redash_03_4_65,"No? Fine then, where's my room?"
d_ex_redash_03_4_66,I'd prefer one with a nice view.
d_ex_redash_03_4_67,"Oh, and does anyone have a spare charger? I was in a bit of a hurry getting here, and forgot mine."
d_ex_redash_03_4_68,How do I put this...
d_ex_redash_03_4_69,She comes on a bit strong.
d_ex_redash_03_4_70,I agree.
d_ex_redash_03_4_71,"Still, it's nice to have someone with a bit of energy."

d_ex_redash_03_5_2,... What a mess.
d_ex_redash_03_5_3,Do you think anyone is alive?
d_ex_redash_03_5_4,Highly doubtful.
d_ex_redash_03_5_5,You said this was an internal conflict amongst the mass-produced Nikkes?
d_ex_redash_03_5_6,Sounds like we're dealing with a civil war.
d_ex_redash_03_5_7,Reports are that inner skirmishes have occurred amongst one of the specialized units.
d_ex_redash_03_5_8,The offending unit in question is comprised of mass-produced Nikkes who specialize in melee combat.
d_ex_redash_03_5_9,"Considering the state this place is in, I'd say their skills are beyond reproach."
d_ex_redash_03_5_10,... Do you happen to know if that unit uses swords?
d_ex_redash_03_5_11,"Yes, they do. How did you know that? This is supposed to be classified information."
d_ex_redash_03_5_12,"I couldn't find any bullet holes or remnants from any explosions. All I see are slash marks, which indicate that something sharp was used."
d_ex_redash_03_5_13,Using a sword against a Rapture? Is that even possible?
d_ex_redash_03_5_14,"I'd say they achieved something, even if it's nothing to write home about."
d_ex_redash_03_5_15,"Anyway, I don't think there's much point in searching for survivors."
d_ex_redash_03_5_16,But let's look all the same.
d_ex_redash_03_5_17,Rapunzel and I will check the right.
d_ex_redash_03_5_18,Snow and I will take the front.
d_ex_redash_03_5_19,"I guess that leaves the left for you and me, Commander."
d_ex_redash_03_5_20,You lead the way.
d_ex_redash_03_5_21,Okay.
d_ex_redash_03_5_22,"No one move,"
d_ex_redash_03_5_23,or I'll slash you where you stand.
d_ex_redash_03_5_24,What's a sword master doing here?
d_ex_redash_03_5_25,"Are you a survivor? Wait, let me check you to se..."
d_ex_redash_03_5_26,I told you to stay put.
d_ex_redash_03_5_27,...?
d_ex_redash_03_5_28,Are you a survivor from the specialized units?
d_ex_redash_03_5_29,Survivor?
d_ex_redash_03_5_30,Dost I look like I depend on the mercy of others to survive?
d_ex_redash_03_5_31,Are you saying...
d_ex_redash_03_5_32,... Are you responsible for all this?
d_ex_redash_03_5_33,...
d_ex_redash_03_5_34,Leave this place. Do not desecrate my friend's battlefield.
d_ex_redash_03_5_35,And if we refuse?
d_ex_redash_03_5_36,Then prepare to meet the business end of my blade.
d_ex_redash_03_5_37,...
d_ex_redash_03_5_38,"Who the hell do you think you are, threatening us?!"
d_ex_redash_03_5_39,I'd like to see you try and use that sword on me!
d_ex_redash_03_5_40,*Tap tap tap*
d_ex_redash_03_5_41,Red Hood starts to juke left and right.
d_ex_redash_03_5_42,You see how quickly I move? What are you gonna do now?
d_ex_redash_03_5_43,"Come on, just try and hit me with that kitchen knife of yours."
d_ex_redash_03_5_44,Ah...
d_ex_redash_03_5_45,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_03_5_46,...!
d_ex_redash_03_5_47,Scarlet rushes forward in a sudden gust of wind and quickly closes in on Red Hood.
d_ex_redash_03_5_48,"With startling speed, she swings her sword, and just as the blade is about to touch Red Hood's neck..."
d_ex_redash_03_5_49,*Clank*
d_ex_redash_03_5_50,Red Hood raises her rifle to block the strike.
d_ex_redash_03_5_51,!!
d_ex_redash_03_5_52,What the...?!
d_ex_redash_03_5_53,You actually took a swing at me?! Have you lost your mind?

d_ex_redash_03_5_55,"Red Hood and Scarlet start trading blows, descending into a flurry of punches and kicks."
d_ex_redash_03_5_56,You're a pretty good scrapper. Do you fight a lot?
d_ex_redash_03_5_57,What dost thou think?
d_ex_redash_03_5_58,"Forsooth, mine thoughts doth come up empty-handed!"
d_ex_redash_03_5_59,One of Red Hood's kicks lands square on Scarlet's stomach.
d_ex_redash_03_5_60,*Pow*
d_ex_redash_03_5_61,Argh!
d_ex_redash_03_5_62,Scarlet smacks Red Hood in the ribs with the blunt end of her sword.

d_ex_redash_03_5_64,Argh!
d_ex_redash_03_5_65,Shouldn't we stop them?
d_ex_redash_03_5_66,Probably should.
d_ex_redash_03_5_67,Liliweiss darts in between the two dueling Nikkes.
d_ex_redash_03_5_68,So fast...
d_ex_redash_03_5_69,"Hey, don't get in our way!"
d_ex_redash_03_5_70,What's your name?
d_ex_redash_03_5_71,Red Hood?
d_ex_redash_03_5_72,Not you.
d_ex_redash_03_5_73,Why dost thou inquire as to my name?
d_ex_redash_03_5_74,I want to recruit you.
d_ex_redash_03_5_75,... What?
d_ex_redash_03_5_76,Huh?
d_ex_redash_03_5_77,You were clearly holding back just now. Is it because you didn't want to kill your opponent?
d_ex_redash_03_5_78,You're good.
d_ex_redash_03_5_79,Holding back? What're you talking about?
d_ex_redash_03_5_80,...
d_ex_redash_03_5_81,We are the Goddess Squad. I'm sure you've heard of us.
d_ex_redash_03_5_82,... I'm familiar.
d_ex_redash_03_5_83,"Then join us, and we can fight together."
d_ex_redash_03_5_84,"If you think I'm gonna be on the same team as this Neanderthal, you're dreaming."
d_ex_redash_03_5_85,"Come now, Red Hood, you don't have to pretend. We know she's just your cup of tea."
d_ex_redash_03_5_86,...
d_ex_redash_03_5_87,How about it? Do you want to work together?
d_ex_redash_03_5_88,Dost thou ask if I want to be thy comrade?
d_ex_redash_03_5_89,"Yes, we need people like you."
d_ex_redash_03_5_90,Tsk.
d_ex_redash_03_5_91,"If you defeat me, I will accept."
d_ex_redash_03_5_92,*Pow*
d_ex_redash_03_5_93,"Liliweiss takes one swing, and Scarlet is slammed onto the ground."
d_ex_redash_03_5_94,...
d_ex_redash_03_5_95,You knocked her out cold.
d_ex_redash_03_5_96,I'd say the recruitment has been a success.

d_ex_redash_04_1_12,"Anyway, what's all this about calling me a busybody?"
d_ex_redash_04_1_13,Lilith occasionally calls me that too.
d_ex_redash_04_1_14,Is that supposed to be my new nickname or something?
d_ex_redash_04_1_15,Do you really not see why we'd call you that?
d_ex_redash_04_1_16,"No, I don't."

d_ex_redash_04_1_18,Like what?

d_ex_redash_04_1_20,If you put this here...
d_ex_redash_04_1_21,"Hmm, maybe not."
d_ex_redash_04_1_22,I don't think that's gonna work.
d_ex_redash_04_1_23,Gah! You surprised me. What do you want?
d_ex_redash_04_1_24,"Yeesh, not the warmest welcome I've ever gotten."

d_ex_redash_04_1_26,...
d_ex_redash_04_1_27,What seems to be the problem?
d_ex_redash_04_1_28,Need any help with the modifications?
d_ex_redash_04_1_29,I used to be pretty good at assembling stuff back in my day.
d_ex_redash_04_1_30,I'm sure that skill would extend to modifications as well.
d_ex_redash_04_1_31,When you say you assembled things... I assume you're referring to plastic models?
d_ex_redash_04_1_32,Yep!
d_ex_redash_04_1_33,*Sigh*
d_ex_redash_04_1_34,I knew it.
d_ex_redash_04_1_35,"You can't even properly maintain your own weapons,"

d_ex_redash_04_1_40,Let me go!
d_ex_redash_04_1_41,You know what I think? I think you underestimate me.
d_ex_redash_04_1_42,I mean what I say.
d_ex_redash_04_1_43,"Fine, then why don't you give it a try?"
d_ex_redash_04_1_44,I'd love to. Hand it over.
d_ex_redash_04_1_45,...
d_ex_redash_04_1_46,Here.
d_ex_redash_04_1_47,Snow White tentatively hands the weapon to Red Hood with a distrusting expression.

d_ex_redash_04_2_47,How'd you do that?
d_ex_redash_04_2_48,"So long as one's hand is steady as thy slashes, a challenge it is most certainly not."

d_ex_redash_04_2_54,Now try it on the tree log! If it's even possible.
d_ex_redash_04_2_55,Of course it is possible.
d_ex_redash_04_2_56,Red Hood proceeds to pick larger and larger objects for Scarlet to cleave.
d_ex_redash_04_2_57,"Okay, this is the final test."
d_ex_redash_04_2_58,"Pray tell, whyever dost thou make mountains of molehills for this final trial?"
d_ex_redash_04_2_59,Because I want you to handle... this!
d_ex_redash_04_2_60,*Thud*
d_ex_redash_04_2_61,Red Hood places a huge fuel tank in front of Scarlet.
d_ex_redash_04_2_62,"If you can pull this off, I'll concede, without contest, that you're the finest swordsman there ever was."
d_ex_redash_04_2_63,"Forsooth, this will be a most challenging trial."

d_ex_redash_04_2_68,"Unfortunately, you left a pretty obvious mark on it."
d_ex_redash_04_2_69,"Tis due to the enormity of the object, as well as its composition."
d_ex_redash_04_2_70,"An easy task, it is most certainly not."
d_ex_redash_04_2_71,Don't tell me you're giving up already?
d_ex_redash_04_2_72,Aren't you supposed to be the world's best swordsman?
d_ex_redash_04_2_73,"If you throw in the towel now, that title might as well be null and void."
d_ex_redash_04_2_74,...
d_ex_redash_04_2_75,Not a chance.
d_ex_redash_04_2_76,"I will press on, until I succeed!"

d_ex_redash_04_3_5,"You're bang-on about that, Miss."
d_ex_redash_04_3_6,You're looking quite fetching today as well.
d_ex_redash_04_3_7,"Thank you for the compliment, but I've told you not to call me that."
d_ex_redash_04_3_8,How can I not? You practically exude elegance hauling around that parasol.
d_ex_redash_04_3_9,I've told you just as many times not to be self-conscious about me addressing you that way.
d_ex_redash_04_3_10,"You always need to have the final word, don't you?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_11,"I can't stand losing. If I lose, I can't sleep at night."
d_ex_redash_04_3_12,It's the same for me.
d_ex_redash_04_3_13,You don't say?
d_ex_redash_04_3_14,We're practically birds of a feather.
d_ex_redash_04_3_15,That we are.
d_ex_redash_04_3_16,Would you like to join me for a walk?
d_ex_redash_04_3_17,There's somewhere I want to show you.
d_ex_redash_04_3_18,Oh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
d_ex_redash_04_3_19,May I be so bold as to accompany such a lovely lady on an afternoon stroll?
d_ex_redash_04_3_20,... You may.
d_ex_redash_04_3_21,"After all that sweet talk back there, and this is how you're going to treat me?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_22,What are you talking about?
d_ex_redash_04_3_23,This.
d_ex_redash_04_3_24,Red Hood gestures toward Dorothy's parasol.
d_ex_redash_04_3_25,You're hogging it all to yourself.
d_ex_redash_04_3_26,It's meant for one person.
d_ex_redash_04_3_27,"Also, be warned:"
d_ex_redash_04_3_28,don't even think about trying to sneak up on me like you do with Snow White.
d_ex_redash_04_3_29,"Ouch, how can you say such cruel things?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_30,I have no intention of doing any such thing.
d_ex_redash_04_3_31,I know perfectly well how much you hate that kind of stuff.
d_ex_redash_04_3_32,Good.
d_ex_redash_04_3_33,Although hearing you confirm it kinda makes me want to do it even more.
d_ex_redash_04_3_34,...
d_ex_redash_04_3_35,"Anyway, is this the place you were talking about?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_36,It sure is pretty.
d_ex_redash_04_3_37,But that cliff looks a bit danger... Ah!
d_ex_redash_04_3_38,What are you doing?!
d_ex_redash_04_3_39,"Darn, I miscalculated."
d_ex_redash_04_3_40,I was hoping I could nudge you over the edge
d_ex_redash_04_3_41,with my parasol while you were distracted.
d_ex_redash_04_3_42,"Like I told you, I can't stand losing either."
d_ex_redash_04_3_43,Wait!
d_ex_redash_04_3_44,"You're just having fun, right? This is all a big joke?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_45,"Let's use our words, okay?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_46,Are you going to keep calling me Miss?
d_ex_redash_04_3_47,"Okay, okay! I won't call you that anymore. Just stop aiming that thing at me."
d_ex_redash_04_3_48,Very well.
d_ex_redash_04_3_49,Red Hood lets out a sigh of relief as Dorothy withdraws her parasol.
d_ex_redash_04_3_50,"You weren't actually serious, were you?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_51,Half and half.
d_ex_redash_04_3_52,"However, you did say that you'd stop calling me Miss, so..."
d_ex_redash_04_3_53,"Sure, for today."
d_ex_redash_04_3_54,??
d_ex_redash_04_3_55,I didn't say until when.
d_ex_redash_04_3_56,"So, for today, and today only, I won't call you Miss."
d_ex_redash_04_3_57,You tricked me.
d_ex_redash_04_3_58,"Tricked is a bit of a strong word, don't you think?"
d_ex_redash_04_3_59,I was only joking... hey! Hey!

d_ex_redash_05_2_19,What?
d_ex_redash_05_2_20,You're always in a funk whenever you come back from this place.
d_ex_redash_05_2_21,That's no way for a squad leader to act.
d_ex_redash_05_2_22,"So I'm not allowed to feel sadness, is that it?"

d_ex_redash_05_2_26,"If you come here and speak into the void, do those you have lost talk back to you?"
d_ex_redash_05_2_27,Don't call her that.
d_ex_redash_05_2_28,That's what she is. She's dead. Out of commission.
d_ex_redash_05_2_29,Don't treat her death so flippantly.
d_ex_redash_05_2_30,You haven't answered my question. Why do you come here?
d_ex_redash_05_2_31,The fact that she's dead is due to no fault of your own.
d_ex_redash_05_2_32,... Part of it is my fault.
d_ex_redash_05_2_33,"The first Grimms model was created based on a prototype,"
d_ex_redash_05_2_34,which was you.
d_ex_redash_05_2_35,"The proper adjustments weren't made during her creation, and she couldn't handle the physical strain, leading to her death."
d_ex_redash_05_2_36,"The lessons learned from that mistake mean that all subsequent models did not have this defect, and thus were safe from harm."
d_ex_redash_05_2_37,Where in that equation are you remotely at fault?
d_ex_redash_05_2_38,...
d_ex_redash_05_2_39,"Besides, this is not even her final resting place."

d_ex_redash_05_2_42,And...
d_ex_redash_05_2_43,The Liliweiss flower blooms here as well.
d_ex_redash_05_2_44,...
d_ex_redash_05_2_45,"Even now, only one lone flower has bloomed. I felt there was somehow a significance to that."
d_ex_redash_05_2_46,There's no greater meaning behind it whatsoever.
d_ex_redash_05_2_47,"Under the right conditions, the flowers can bloom just about anywhere."
d_ex_redash_05_2_48,Don't go trying to attach meaning to something when there's none.
d_ex_redash_05_2_49,"I see you have no intention of comforting me, then."
d_ex_redash_05_2_50,Glad you got the hint.

d_ex_redash_05_2_54,Okay.
d_ex_redash_05_2_55,I'll admit that I've been weak.
d_ex_redash_05_2_56,"She was someone very close to me, and I was too attached, so I haven't gotten over it just yet."
d_ex_redash_05_2_57,"I will not come back here. Truth be told, I knew from the start that this place wouldn't assuage my sorrow."
d_ex_redash_05_2_58,"I'll simply keep her here, in my mind."
d_ex_redash_05_2_59,Good. Then let's burn it.
d_ex_redash_05_2_60,"No, don't."
d_ex_redash_05_2_61,Why not? You'll only come back again.
d_ex_redash_05_2_62,I won't.
d_ex_redash_05_2_63,Can you promise me?
d_ex_redash_05_2_64,Yes. I promise.
d_ex_redash_05_2_65,But you have to promise me something in return.
d_ex_redash_05_2_66,What is it?
d_ex_redash_05_2_67,"When we die,"
d_ex_redash_05_2_68,please don't do what I did.
d_ex_redash_05_2_69,"If you all die, I'll more than likely have perished along with you."
d_ex_redash_05_2_70,"But if you don't, promise me that..."
d_ex_redash_05_2_71,No.
d_ex_redash_05_2_72,"When you die, I'll visit your graves every year,"
d_ex_redash_05_2_73,and I'll cry my eyes out.
d_ex_redash_05_2_74,... Please don't do that.
d_ex_redash_05_2_75,"If you don't want that to happen, then don't die on me."

d_ex_redash_06_1_3,Rapunzel rummages through the drawer.
d_ex_redash_06_1_4,*Click*
d_ex_redash_06_1_5,A videotape?
d_ex_redash_06_1_6,Rapunzel grabs the videotape from inside the drawer.
d_ex_redash_06_1_7,Body Talk?
d_ex_redash_06_1_8,This must be it.
d_ex_redash_06_1_9,"How do I play it... Ah, here it is."

d_ex_redash_06_1_21,Good God! How is that even physically possible?
d_ex_redash_06_1_22,!!
d_ex_redash_06_1_23,No! I can't watch any more of this!
d_ex_redash_06_1_24,I should be studying instead of watching such obscene footage.
d_ex_redash_06_1_25,But... is this not studying as well?
d_ex_redash_06_1_26,Studying the human body?
d_ex_redash_06_1_27,...

d_ex_redash_06_1_36,"Yes, I need to educate myself on these matters."

d_ex_redash_06_1_57,N-never mind.

d_ex_redash_06_2_12,...
d_ex_redash_06_2_13,Something so obscene should remain hidden away so that it can't corrupt any more people!

d_ex_redash_07_2_4,Hello guys.
d_ex_redash_07_2_5,I arranged for this video to be automatically transmitted to you when my life signal goes out.
d_ex_redash_07_2_6,"I hate having to use this term,"
d_ex_redash_07_2_7,but I suppose you could consider this my last will and testament.
d_ex_redash_07_2_8,... Anyways.
d_ex_redash_07_2_9,"We came in contact with each other, and the world around us, without knowing much about either."
d_ex_redash_07_2_10,"We fought, laughed, cried,"
d_ex_redash_07_2_11,and went through a lot together.
d_ex_redash_07_2_12,"We met the commander and fought for humanity, becoming a shining beacon of hope."
d_ex_redash_07_2_13,"We bid farewell to some dear friends, and saw the world crumble around us."
d_ex_redash_07_2_14,There were times when you wanted to give up. I know because I felt that way too.
d_ex_redash_07_2_15,"But, please,"
d_ex_redash_07_2_16,never forget everything that you've overcome.
d_ex_redash_07_2_17,You've kept the entire human race safe.
d_ex_redash_07_2_18,You saved this world.
d_ex_redash_07_2_19,"Whatever you do, and wherever you go, nothing will ever change that."

d_ex_redash_07_2_21,...

d_ex_library_07_3,Didn't imagine I'd see you at the Library.
d_ex_library_07_4,Hmm? What do you mean?
d_ex_library_07_5,I come here all the time.
d_ex_library_07_6,You do?
d_ex_library_07_7,"Of course! Any survival expert worth their salt knows that reading books is a must for building up your knowledge,"
d_ex_library_07_8,so I do it regularly.
d_ex_library_07_9,So cool! You really are a survival expert.
d_ex_library_07_10,"Hehe, I appreciate the compliment."
d_ex_library_07_11,Glad to see that you're finally starting to appreciate me.
d_ex_library_07_12,I didn't say anything just now...
d_ex_library_07_13,... Huh?
d_ex_library_07_14,Who was that then?
d_ex_library_07_15,Me.
d_ex_library_07_16,"Nice to meet you, Tove."
d_ex_library_07_17,"Hey, Teacher."
d_ex_library_07_18,Naga? What are you doing on your own?
d_ex_library_07_19,Where's Tia?
d_ex_library_07_20,"Yeesh, what are we, glued at the hip?"
d_ex_library_07_21,"I'm perfectly capable of studying on my own, which is what I've come here for today."
d_ex_library_07_22,"And I'm glad that I did,"
d_ex_library_07_23,"cause I got the chance to see you, Tove!"
d_ex_library_07_24,Why are you so excited about seeing me?
d_ex_library_07_25,I'm a big fan of the Unlimited Squad.
d_ex_library_07_26,Meeting you is like meeting one of my heroes!
d_ex_library_07_27,"Hehe, you remind me of myself back in the day."
d_ex_library_07_28,"I used to be crazy about Unlimited. A real fangirl, I was."
d_ex_library_07_29,"All I would think about was how I could join them one day,"
d_ex_library_07_30,and stand shoulder to shoulder with those Nikkes as they rescued those in need without breaking a sweat.
d_ex_library_07_31,Totally!
d_ex_library_07_32,They're on a completely different level from the rest of us Nikkes.
d_ex_library_07_33,"The way you describe it sounds kinda strange, though."
d_ex_library_07_34,Hmm? Why?
d_ex_library_07_35,"You're a member of that squad now,"
d_ex_library_07_36,yet you make it sound like you're a complete outsider.
d_ex_library_07_37,"Oh, eh... you've got me there."
d_ex_library_07_38,"I'm a new member, and I haven't managed to distinguish myself just yet."
d_ex_library_07_39,No marvelous deeds or anything of note worth bragging about.
d_ex_library_07_40,"I feel like I'm an impostor, a normie amongst true masters."
d_ex_library_07_41,You should have heard yourself
d_ex_library_07_42,when you were talking about survival experts having to be well-read on all sorts of topics.
d_ex_library_07_43,You sounded super cool!
d_ex_library_07_44,...
d_ex_library_07_45,I... I did?
d_ex_library_07_46,So you oughta be proud of being a member of the Unlimited Squad.
d_ex_library_07_47,"No matter what happens,"
d_ex_library_07_48,you can always count on me being your fan.
d_ex_library_07_49,Naga fetches the book she was looking for and leaves.
d_ex_library_07_50,...
d_ex_library_07_51,Tove?
d_ex_library_07_52,Heh-heh-heh.
d_ex_library_07_53,"Can I be real with you for a moment, Survivalist?"
d_ex_library_07_54,I never was completely convinced that reading books is as useful as I make it out to be.
d_ex_library_07_55,"Sometimes, I'd find myself seriously doubting"
d_ex_library_07_56,whether it actually helped any in actual combat.
d_ex_library_07_57,"But after hearing what Naga had to say, I've made up my mind:"
d_ex_library_07_58,"I will continue to learn as much as I can, so that I can be the best survival expert I can be!"
d_ex_library_07_59,"I am a proud member of Unlimited,"
d_ex_library_07_60,and I must live up to the precedent set by my predecessors.
d_ex_library_07_61,"Mark my words, Survivalist,"
d_ex_library_07_62,I will continue to work harder than ever!

d_ex_powerplant_06_4,Wow... this must be the central control room of the Generator.
d_ex_powerplant_06_5,That's right.
d_ex_powerplant_06_6,But... is it even possible?
d_ex_powerplant_06_7,That killer of devices...
d_ex_powerplant_06_8,Are you intending to make a machine that can withstand Ludmilla's touch?
d_ex_powerplant_06_9,"Yeah, it may take some time,"
d_ex_powerplant_06_10,but I'll succeed one of these days.
d_ex_powerplant_06_11,I admire your determination.
d_ex_powerplant_06_12,Thanks. May I have a look around?
d_ex_powerplant_06_13,Be my guest.
d_ex_powerplant_06_14,Thanks!
d_ex_powerplant_06_15,"I have to say, this isn't at all what I expected the Generator to look like."
d_ex_powerplant_06_16,Interesting...
d_ex_powerplant_06_17,So this is how the wires are interconnected...
d_ex_powerplant_06_18,Hmm... I must learn this technique.
d_ex_powerplant_06_19,"What's going on here, Cutey?"
d_ex_powerplant_06_20,She seems abnormally intrigued by mechanics.
d_ex_powerplant_06_21,She's a dedicated survival expert.
d_ex_powerplant_06_22,She's a dedicated gearhead.
d_ex_powerplant_06_23,"Ah, that explains it. She certainly has the temperament for it."
d_ex_powerplant_06_24,You see how her eyes sparkle?
d_ex_powerplant_06_25,That shows me that she has an insatiable thirst for knowledge.
d_ex_powerplant_06_26,That's not something you see very often.
d_ex_powerplant_06_27,You seem to be basing this off personal experience.
d_ex_powerplant_06_28,Indeed I am.
d_ex_powerplant_06_29,That's an expression you'd never see on any of those dunderheads from my squad.
d_ex_powerplant_06_30,"Hero, coming in hot!"
d_ex_powerplant_06_31,Hyyyahhh!
d_ex_powerplant_06_32,What are you all doing sneaking around here?
d_ex_powerplant_06_33,"Apparently, even fools love a bit of attention."
d_ex_powerplant_06_34,"Say their name, and they come running."
d_ex_powerplant_06_35,"Anyway, feel free to look around."
d_ex_powerplant_06_36,"As for you two, beat it!"
d_ex_powerplant_06_37,"Hey, what's the big idea? What're you getting rid of me for?"
d_ex_powerplant_06_38,This is awfully suspicious!
d_ex_powerplant_06_39,Very suspicious indeed!
d_ex_powerplant_06_40,What are you all looking at? I wanna see it too.
d_ex_powerplant_06_41,Would you please keep it down?!
d_ex_powerplant_06_42,Maxwell leads Laplace and Drake away.
d_ex_powerplant_06_43,How's the investigation going?
d_ex_powerplant_06_44,Yes!
d_ex_powerplant_06_45,It's going well.
d_ex_powerplant_06_46,Thanks for asking.
d_ex_powerplant_06_47,"Thanks to you, I've been able to probe around unimpeded."
d_ex_powerplant_06_48,I think I'll have a machine that can withstand Ludmilla's touch soon enough!
d_ex_powerplant_06_49,"That'll give everyone something to cheer about,"
d_ex_powerplant_06_50,and it'll make our squad stronger.
d_ex_powerplant_06_51,Not to mention that my position in Unlimited will be well and truly consolidated.
d_ex_powerplant_06_52,"Just imagine,"
d_ex_powerplant_06_53,"I may end up going from a newcomer, to someone indispensable!"
d_ex_powerplant_06_54,"The other members will all say,"

d_ex_powerplant_06_56,"Oh boy, what should I say to them then?"
d_ex_powerplant_06_57,So that's why you're doing this?
d_ex_powerplant_06_58,N-no!
d_ex_powerplant_06_59,"I just went off on a small tangent, that's all."
d_ex_powerplant_06_60,It's nice daydreaming for a little while.
d_ex_powerplant_06_61,"At any rate, I've got to keep at it."
d_ex_powerplant_06_62,I've got to get this machine made!
d_ex_powerplant_06_63,Failure is not an option.
d_ex_powerplant_06_64,Best of luck.

d_ex_workshop_07_6,Why don't you try it then?
d_ex_workshop_07_7,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_07_8,Wouldn't that be a bit out of line?

d_ex_workshop_07_11,Yeah...
d_ex_workshop_07_12,I'll cover for you. Do what you need to do.
d_ex_workshop_07_13,You will?
d_ex_workshop_07_14,"All right then, I'll get started!"

d_ex_workshop_07_26,She's out.
d_ex_workshop_07_27,"Well, that's no good."
d_ex_workshop_07_28,I've got an urgent order.
d_ex_workshop_07_29,Why don't you tell Tove about it?
d_ex_workshop_07_30,She's good at crafting all sorts of stuff.
d_ex_workshop_07_31,W-what are you talking about?
d_ex_workshop_07_32,"I mean, it's nice to be complimented, but..."
d_ex_workshop_07_33,"... Fine, I'll bite."
d_ex_workshop_07_34,"If Client recommends you, it's worth a shot, I suppose."
d_ex_workshop_07_35,Here's the design I'm after. Can you do it?
d_ex_workshop_07_36,Tove scrutinizes the blueprints that Dolla hands her.
d_ex_workshop_07_37,Let's see...
d_ex_workshop_07_38,"Okay, no problem."
d_ex_workshop_07_39,I can make this in an hour or so.
d_ex_workshop_07_40,An hour?
d_ex_workshop_07_41,That's all?
d_ex_workshop_07_42,Yep!
d_ex_workshop_07_43,"Well, I'll let you get to it then."
d_ex_workshop_07_44,Okay!
d_ex_workshop_07_45,Tove's words have barely left her mouth when she springs into action.
d_ex_workshop_07_46,About an hour later.
d_ex_workshop_07_47,All finished!
d_ex_workshop_07_48,!
d_ex_workshop_07_49,Dolla takes the object from Tove and examines it carefully.
d_ex_workshop_07_50,...
d_ex_workshop_07_51,You actually pulled it off.
d_ex_workshop_07_52,Your craftsmanship is no joke!
d_ex_workshop_07_53,Would you ever consider working for me?
d_ex_workshop_07_54,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_07_55,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm working with the Unlimited Squad now."
d_ex_workshop_07_56,I know that.
d_ex_workshop_07_57,I mean do you want a part-time job?
d_ex_workshop_07_58,A part-time job? I never considered that...
d_ex_workshop_07_59,*Zing*
d_ex_workshop_07_60,"Liter, are you in there?"
d_ex_workshop_07_61,Huh?! What in the world?
d_ex_workshop_07_62,How come there are so many customers?
d_ex_workshop_07_63,Because you're late.
d_ex_workshop_07_64,"Yan,"
d_ex_workshop_07_65,I've got a sample of that thing you wanted.
d_ex_workshop_07_66,Already?
d_ex_workshop_07_67,You're kidding.
d_ex_workshop_07_68,I was told it'd take at least three hours to complete.
d_ex_workshop_07_69,Liter really is something.
d_ex_workshop_07_70,It wasn't Liter who made it.
d_ex_workshop_07_71,Huh? What did you say?
d_ex_workshop_07_72,Who else could accomplish this so quickly?
d_ex_workshop_07_73,"It wasn't Centi, was it?"
d_ex_workshop_07_74,Um... I did.
d_ex_workshop_07_75,What the... who are you?
d_ex_workshop_07_76,Turns out we've got a bona fide prodigy amongst us!
d_ex_workshop_07_77,"Hey, do you want to come work with me?"
d_ex_workshop_07_78,I'll pay you well.
d_ex_workshop_07_79,"Save it, Yan."
d_ex_workshop_07_80,I already gave her an offer.
d_ex_workshop_07_81,"Bah, I should have known you'd try and undercut me."
d_ex_workshop_07_82,Please don't fight...
d_ex_workshop_07_83,"At any rate, I'm not interested in any part-time work."
d_ex_workshop_07_84,Unbelievable!
d_ex_workshop_07_85,How dare you make such a scene in the sacred Workshop?
d_ex_workshop_07_86,"I'm gone for five minutes, and you still manage to kick up a commotion."
d_ex_workshop_07_87,Forget about that. Look at this.
d_ex_workshop_07_88,"She made this within an hour, all according to the specifications as well."
d_ex_workshop_07_89,Surely you'd want someone with that kind of talent on your team as well?
d_ex_workshop_07_90,What is this?
d_ex_workshop_07_91,Let me see.
d_ex_workshop_07_92,...
d_ex_workshop_07_93,*Bang*
d_ex_workshop_07_94,*Collapse*
d_ex_workshop_07_95,Apparently all that glitters is not gold.
d_ex_workshop_07_96,I can't believe you all were fooled by this hunk of junk.
d_ex_workshop_07_97,It's no better than a child's toy.
d_ex_workshop_07_98,"If she wants to be a true master, she's got a whole lot of training left to do."
d_ex_workshop_07_99,Survivalist...
d_ex_workshop_07_100,I think now is where we run.
d_ex_workshop_07_101,Wait up!
d_ex_workshop_07_102,"Hey, stop right there!"
d_ex_workshop_07_103,"Tove and I hurriedly flee the Workshop,"
d_ex_workshop_07_104,leaving the furious Dolla and Yan yelling behind us.
d_ex_cafe_07_title,Successful Menu Revamp?
d_ex_cafe_07_1,"Hey, Pal! You got here just in time!"
d_ex_cafe_07_2,"Finally, someone I can trust."
d_ex_cafe_07_3,Sit here.
d_ex_cafe_07_4,"Hiya, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_cafe_07_5,I was wondering who's at the door.
d_ex_cafe_07_6,Come on in.
d_ex_cafe_07_7,Mica? Ludmilla?
d_ex_cafe_07_8,Why are you dressed like that?
d_ex_cafe_07_9,Cafe Sweety asked us to come dressed like this.
d_ex_cafe_07_10,"Apparently, they're changing the cafe's concept."
d_ex_cafe_07_11,"That's right, we're in a real pickle at the moment."
d_ex_cafe_07_12,Customer numbers and overall sales are both through the floor.
d_ex_cafe_07_13,"So, we're thinking of revitalizing the cafe ambiance and adding new items to our menu."
d_ex_cafe_07_14,"Then, we'll be officially unveiling the NEW Cafe."
d_ex_cafe_07_15,"From the looks of it,"
d_ex_cafe_07_16,this new menu is going to be tea-centric?
d_ex_cafe_07_17,That's right.
d_ex_cafe_07_18,"Ludmilla is a veritable encyclopedia when it comes to tea,"
d_ex_cafe_07_19,and she was kind enough to fill us in on a few secrets.
d_ex_cafe_07_20,"Hehe... Well, you all were fantastic listeners."
d_ex_cafe_07_21,I had an absolute blast teaching you.
d_ex_cafe_07_22,"Will you be making tea as well, Mica?"
d_ex_cafe_07_23,"Hehe, nope."
d_ex_cafe_07_24,I'm just gonna help with serving!
d_ex_cafe_07_25,Um... What did they tell me again?
d_ex_cafe_07_26,"If the servers here wear special outfits like they do at the Maid Cafe,"
d_ex_cafe_07_27,it'll amp up the customers' enjoyment.
d_ex_cafe_07_28,Business image.
d_ex_cafe_07_29,"Yeah, exactly!"
d_ex_cafe_07_30,So that's why I'm here dressed like this. Hehe.
d_ex_cafe_07_31,"I've only really worn this before at Snowfield Hot Spring, so I feel a bit self-conscious wearing it here..."
d_ex_cafe_07_32,I hope everyone likes it...
d_ex_cafe_07_33,Smiles. Healing power. Great.
d_ex_cafe_07_34,So are you all ready to relaunch the business?
d_ex_cafe_07_35,Not just yet.
d_ex_cafe_07_36,"Lastly, I'd appreciate if you and Ludmilla could help us test a few things."
d_ex_cafe_07_37,What'll we be testing?
d_ex_cafe_07_38,"The food, the service quality, and all that jazz."
d_ex_cafe_07_39,"After experiencing it firsthand, you can give it all a rating on this tablet."
d_ex_cafe_07_40,"Well then, I'll leave it to you!"
d_ex_cafe_07_41,Look forward. A lot.
d_ex_cafe_07_42,I shall look forward to your menu and service.
d_ex_cafe_07_43,I-I'll do my best!
d_ex_cafe_07_44,All of Cafe Sweety's squad members takes their position at the counter.
d_ex_cafe_07_45,"All right, everyone, let's get to work!"
d_ex_cafe_07_46,Y-yes!
d_ex_cafe_07_47,Um...
d_ex_cafe_07_48,"W-welcome, Old-Timer and Ludmilla... Er, I mean, distinguished guests!"
d_ex_cafe_07_49,L-let me show you to your table!
d_ex_cafe_07_50,Ludmilla and I settle into the seats that Mica led us to.
d_ex_cafe_07_51,What would you like to order?
d_ex_cafe_07_52,"As I flip through the menu,"
d_ex_cafe_07_53,my eyes skim through the usual selection of various coffees.
d_ex_cafe_07_54,"Before I know it, I catch sight of a brand-new Tea section in big, bold letters."
d_ex_cafe_07_55,It looks there aren't any tea options listed on the menu.
d_ex_cafe_07_56,Wh-wha? That can't be!
d_ex_cafe_07_57,I'm positive that I wrote them all down earlier!
d_ex_cafe_07_58,M-may I see the menu for a moment?
d_ex_cafe_07_59,Here.
d_ex_cafe_07_60,...
d_ex_cafe_07_61,Oh my goodness!
d_ex_cafe_07_62,I must have brought you an unfinished menu by mistake.
d_ex_cafe_07_63,... *Sob* ... I'm sorry.
d_ex_cafe_07_64,It's okay.
d_ex_cafe_07_65,I'll just have a cup of tea. Any type is fine.
d_ex_cafe_07_66,W-wait a sec!
d_ex_cafe_07_67,Let me think about the menu for a moment!
d_ex_cafe_07_68,"We definitely have black tea, green tea, and..."
d_ex_cafe_07_69,The rest are... Um... I...
d_ex_cafe_07_70,Mica.
d_ex_cafe_07_71,You're psyching yourself out. Take a moment to collect yourself.
d_ex_cafe_07_72,Remember all the training we've done on
d_ex_cafe_07_73,how to deal with unexpected situations.
d_ex_cafe_07_74,"Oh, right!"
d_ex_cafe_07_75,Let's see...
d_ex_cafe_07_76,W-would you be interested in trying our Signature Tea?
d_ex_cafe_07_77,"Yes, I'd love to try that."
d_ex_cafe_07_78,I'll have the same.
d_ex_cafe_07_79,"Hehe, all right!"
d_ex_cafe_07_80,Mica heads to the counter and submits our order.
d_ex_cafe_07_81,I'm quite intrigued to know what exactly this Signature Tea is.
d_ex_cafe_07_82,"You won't be disappointed, Servant, I can assure you."
d_ex_cafe_07_83,"It's a special, yet simple, recipe that I shared with them."
d_ex_cafe_07_84,"The aroma and the taste are sublime and subtle,"
d_ex_cafe_07_85,and I've never known anyone to not enjoy it.
d_ex_cafe_07_86,"Cool, hearing that makes me even more interested."
d_ex_cafe_07_87,Here are your Signature Teas.
d_ex_cafe_07_88,Thanks.
d_ex_cafe_07_89,*Gulp*
d_ex_cafe_07_90,"As I savored the sip of tea, an indescribable taste spreads throughout my mouth."
d_ex_cafe_07_91,Pfff--
d_ex_cafe_07_92,"Ah, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_cafe_07_93,"Are you okay? Here, wipe yourself with this handkerchief!"
d_ex_cafe_07_94,"What's wrong, Servant?"
d_ex_cafe_07_95,Did you not enjoy it?
d_ex_cafe_07_96,*Gulp*
d_ex_cafe_07_97,...!
d_ex_cafe_07_98,Who made this tea?
d_ex_cafe_07_99,"Me, why?"
d_ex_cafe_07_100,What did you add to the tea?
d_ex_cafe_07_101,Made it just like you told me to.
d_ex_cafe_07_102,"But it was missing that sweet kick, so I threw in some sugar."
d_ex_cafe_07_103,"No, there's more to this tea than a mere sweetness of sugar."
d_ex_cafe_07_104,"Well, I thought it lacked a certain smoothness, so I added milk."
d_ex_cafe_07_105,Cream. Added.
d_ex_cafe_07_106,What? You guys added stuff too?
d_ex_cafe_07_107,"Then, who's cashing in on this?"
d_ex_cafe_07_108,Me.
d_ex_cafe_07_109,"You were over there sawing logs while Ludmilla was teaching us, you lazy oaf!"
d_ex_cafe_07_110,"Besides, I'm the one who came up with this whole idea, so it's only fair that I get the money."
d_ex_cafe_07_111,"What, just because you added some milk and cream?"
d_ex_cafe_07_112,"Everyone, just simmer down."
d_ex_cafe_07_113,Ludmilla stands up and attempts to mediate the argument within the Cafe Sweety.
d_ex_cafe_07_114,O-Old-Timer?
d_ex_cafe_07_115,Would you like to try this?
d_ex_cafe_07_116,What's this?
d_ex_cafe_07_117,"I made you a new drink, hehe."
d_ex_cafe_07_118,"I've never done this before, so the taste might not be amazing... But if it's all right with you..."
d_ex_cafe_07_119,*Gulp*
d_ex_cafe_07_120,What do you think...?
d_ex_cafe_07_121,"Instead of replying, I enter my rating on the tablet."

d_ex_command_07_title,The Dangerous Cookies
d_ex_command_07_1,"We're here, Commander."
d_ex_command_07_2,"Heya, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_command_07_3,Have you eaten yet?
d_ex_command_07_4,"Yes, I have."
d_ex_command_07_5,"No, not yet."
d_ex_command_07_6,"Aw man, you've already eaten?"
d_ex_command_07_7,"Oh, no worries at all!"
d_ex_command_07_8,We've got some yummy desserts with us too.
d_ex_command_07_9,"Phew, that's a relief!"
d_ex_command_07_10,"We brought you some tasty treats, hehe."
d_ex_command_07_11,"It's dessert though, so it might not be the most filling thing."
d_ex_command_07_12,What made you decide to bring me dessert?
d_ex_command_07_13,Well...
d_ex_command_07_14,*Rustle*
d_ex_command_07_15,"Emma was teaching me how to bake cookies,"
d_ex_command_07_16,"but I'm not great at it,"
d_ex_command_07_17,so I'm not entirely confident how good they are.
d_ex_command_07_18,"But... I still really, really wanted to share them with you, so I brought some!"
d_ex_command_07_19,"Thanks, I'll enjoy them."
d_ex_command_07_20,"Hehe, no problem!"
d_ex_command_07_21,Isn't Mica a cutie-pie?
d_ex_command_07_22,"Oh, and also..."
d_ex_command_07_23,*Rustle*
d_ex_command_07_24,"Here, a little something from me."
d_ex_command_07_25,"While I was teaching her, I made some of my own as well."
d_ex_command_07_26,...
d_ex_command_07_27,Er... Thanks...
d_ex_command_07_28,"Give them a try! They're fresh from the oven, so they should still be warm."
d_ex_command_07_29,And they taste even better that way!
d_ex_command_07_30,Mica and Emma both look at me expectantly.
d_ex_command_07_31,"Um... All right, then."
d_ex_command_07_32,*Rustle*
d_ex_command_07_33,"I've got an idea, Commander."
d_ex_command_07_34,How about we spice things up a bit?
d_ex_command_07_35,*Pour*
d_ex_command_07_36,Emma mixes the cookies she baked with Mica's.
d_ex_command_07_37,??
d_ex_command_07_38,"This way, you won't be sure which ones are baked by whom."
d_ex_command_07_39,It'll add a bit of excitement.
d_ex_command_07_40,"We used different ingredients, so you'll be able to tell the difference right away!"
d_ex_command_07_41,Wow! That's like a quiz or something!
d_ex_command_07_42,"Sounds super fun, hehe."
d_ex_command_07_43,"I know, right?"
d_ex_command_07_44,"Which one would you like to try first, Old-Timer?"
d_ex_command_07_45,Mica hands me two cookies.
d_ex_command_07_46,I'll...
d_ex_command_07_47,Eat the left cookie.
d_ex_command_07_48,Eat the right cookie.
d_ex_command_07_49,I nervously pick up the left cookie and pop it into my mouth.
d_ex_command_07_50,*Crunch*
d_ex_command_07_51,...
d_ex_command_07_52,...!
d_ex_command_07_53,It tastes... sour?
d_ex_command_07_54,"Oh, I think that's the cookie I made!"
d_ex_command_07_55,I added a splash of lemon juice for that extra zing.
d_ex_command_07_56,How is it?
d_ex_command_07_57,It's delicious.
d_ex_command_07_58,"Whoa, really?"
d_ex_command_07_59,I'm glad you like it!
d_ex_command_07_60,I nervously pick up the right cookie and pop it into my mouth.
d_ex_command_07_61,*Crunch*
d_ex_command_07_62,...
d_ex_command_07_63,...
d_ex_command_07_64,... mander... Commander?
d_ex_command_07_65,Huh?
d_ex_command_07_66,"Are you okay, Old-Timer?"
d_ex_command_07_67,You suddenly passed out and gave us quite a scare!
d_ex_command_07_68,... Something tells me I just ate the cookie Emma made.
d_ex_command_07_69,"Well, you look awfully exhausted,"
d_ex_command_07_70,so I added some ingredients into the cookies to help relieve your fatigue.
d_ex_command_07_71,"Go on, take another bite, I promise it'll do wonders!"
d_ex_command_07_72,Which one would you like to try next?
d_ex_command_07_73,I'll try...
d_ex_command_07_74,*Zing*
d_ex_command_07_75,"Hello, Commander!"
d_ex_command_07_76,"Sorry for being late! I was caught up finishing some tasks, and..."
d_ex_command_07_77,... Gasp!
d_ex_command_07_78,Gah!
d_ex_command_07_79,Look at all these bugs!
d_ex_command_07_80,"G-get away from there, Commander!"
d_ex_command_07_81,Let me take care of this!
d_ex_command_07_82,"T-take this, you pesky creepy crawlies!"
d_ex_command_07_83,*Pow pow pow*
d_ex_command_07_84,*Crack crunch*
d_ex_command_07_85,"Before any of us has a chance to stop her, Quiry swiftly pulverizes the cookies on the desk into a fine powder."
d_ex_command_07_86,Mission complete!
d_ex_command_07_87,No! The cookies!
d_ex_command_07_88,Oh dear...
d_ex_command_07_89,"Quiry, those were cookies, not bugs."
d_ex_command_07_90,What? That's impossible!
d_ex_command_07_91,Those were 100% bugs. I saw it clear as day.
d_ex_command_07_92,Wait a...
d_ex_command_07_93,They really were cookies!
d_ex_command_07_94,I-I'm so sorry!
d_ex_command_07_95,"Quiry frantically apologizes to Mica and Emma,"
d_ex_command_07_96,as I find myself inwardly thanking her for decimating those heinous cookies.

d_ex_toyshop_07_3,"H-hey there,"
d_ex_toyshop_07_4,Old-Timer!
d_ex_toyshop_07_5,"As soon as I enter the store, strings of shiny lights festooned around an enormous tree catch my eye."
d_ex_toyshop_07_6,You've redecorated for winter?
d_ex_toyshop_07_7,"I knew you'd catch on so quickly, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_8,"Hehe, absolutely! And guess what? We've got some winter-exclusive toys too!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_9,There are lots of cute things in stock right now.
d_ex_toyshop_07_10,Wanna come see?
d_ex_toyshop_07_11,Sure.

d_ex_toyshop_07_13,While Belorta and Mica displays the new winter limited-edition toys on the counter...
d_ex_toyshop_07_14,*Ding*
d_ex_toyshop_07_15,P-Pit Boss?
d_ex_toyshop_07_16,"Oh? Hey there, Pit Boss!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_17,What are you doing here?
d_ex_toyshop_07_18,Waiting for the two of you.
d_ex_toyshop_07_19,Browsing the new toys they have in stock.
d_ex_toyshop_07_20,!!
d_ex_toyshop_07_21,Holy moly!
d_ex_toyshop_07_22,What a coincidence!
d_ex_toyshop_07_23,What makes you say that?
d_ex_toyshop_07_24,W-we had a feeling that you'd be here for some reason...
d_ex_toyshop_07_25,Looks like we just hit the jackpot!
d_ex_toyshop_07_26,Ah! It's the same for us!
d_ex_toyshop_07_27,"I-I'm here with Blanc... to buy some toys, too."
d_ex_toyshop_07_28,Hmm? More customers?
d_ex_toyshop_07_29,W-welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_07_30,"Hey, isn't that what you wore back at Snowfield Hot Spring?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_31,"I still think it looks fantastic. Don't you agree, Noir?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_32,"Yeah, it's super cute."
d_ex_toyshop_07_33,Thanks!
d_ex_toyshop_07_34,You said you wanted to buy a toy? What exactly do you have in mind?
d_ex_toyshop_07_35,We're looking for something to jazz up our stage!
d_ex_toyshop_07_36,Something that'll not only surprise but truly wow the audience!
d_ex_toyshop_07_37,Have you got anything that fits the bill?
d_ex_toyshop_07_38,It'd be even better if they're related to winter!
d_ex_toyshop_07_39,Hmm... something to decorate the stage...
d_ex_toyshop_07_40,This is a toughie...
d_ex_toyshop_07_41,Why don't you check out our winter selection?
d_ex_toyshop_07_42,I was just about to bring some out to show Old-Timer.
d_ex_toyshop_07_43,You may just find something that catches your eye.
d_ex_toyshop_07_44,Sounds good!
d_ex_toyshop_07_45,"Winter selection, you say? Sounds intriguing!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_46,"All right, then. They're right here."
d_ex_toyshop_07_47,Mica points at the counter.
d_ex_toyshop_07_48,"Wow, that's a lot more than I expected!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_49,... They're all so cute and interesting.
d_ex_toyshop_07_50,"I know, right? Mica and I picked them out together!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_51,I guarantee they'll add an extra dose of excitement to your performances!

d_ex_toyshop_07_53,What's this tree-shaped plushie?
d_ex_toyshop_07_54,"Oh, that one? When you press the button on the back..."
d_ex_toyshop_07_55,Beebeebeep♪ Beebeebeep♪ Beebeebeepbeebeep♪
d_ex_toyshop_07_56,"As music starts playing through a small hidden speaker, the tree begins to dance energetically."
d_ex_toyshop_07_57,"Hahaha, that's so adorable!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_58,I'm sure the audience would love this.
d_ex_toyshop_07_59,"Yeah, I think so too! We'll take two of them, then!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_60,"Mind helping us pick something too, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_61,Something that would make the stage really pop.
d_ex_toyshop_07_62,How about this?
d_ex_toyshop_07_63,A light bulb that's brimming with Christmas vibes.
d_ex_toyshop_07_64,A rabbit figurine with a winter-themed cape.
d_ex_toyshop_07_65,Wow!
d_ex_toyshop_07_66,The colors are incredibly vibrant and lovely!
d_ex_toyshop_07_67,So pretty
d_ex_toyshop_07_68,and eye-catching too!
d_ex_toyshop_07_69,I think it'll look quite nice up on the stage.
d_ex_toyshop_07_70,"Thank you, Pit Boss!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_71,That figurine looks so much like you two!
d_ex_toyshop_07_72,How so?
d_ex_toyshop_07_73,Just look at how cute it is!
d_ex_toyshop_07_74,"Naw, thanks!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_75,"We'll take this as well, then."
d_ex_toyshop_07_76,"Thanks, Mica!"
d_ex_toyshop_07_77,"But, what's the deal with that red box in the corner?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_78,I've been curious about it since earlier!
d_ex_toyshop_07_79,"Oh, that?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_80,I've actually never seen this box before...
d_ex_toyshop_07_81,Mica opens the red box lying in the corner.
d_ex_toyshop_07_82,*Pow powow*
d_ex_toyshop_07_83,Gah!
d_ex_toyshop_07_84,"With a burst of noise, something white shoots up into the sky."
d_ex_toyshop_07_85,"After an explosion,"
d_ex_toyshop_07_86,a gentle snowfall of white flakes began to flutter through the air.
d_ex_toyshop_07_87,Whoa!
d_ex_toyshop_07_88,How pretty!
d_ex_toyshop_07_89,Surprise!
d_ex_toyshop_07_90,Do you like the gift I prepared for you?
d_ex_toyshop_07_91,"Didn't see that coming, did you?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_92,... *Sob* That was so mean!
d_ex_toyshop_07_93,Y-you really startled me!
d_ex_toyshop_07_94,"What's this snow made of, anyway? Cotton?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_95,What's your point?
d_ex_toyshop_07_96,"Whether it's snow or cotton, it's all pretty, isn't it?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_97,When will I ever find the time to clean all this up...
d_ex_toyshop_07_98,But...
d_ex_toyshop_07_99,"It's really pretty, though."
d_ex_toyshop_07_100,You see?
d_ex_toyshop_07_101,Do you have any more of these toy boxes?
d_ex_toyshop_07_102,"Hmm? Yeah, I do. Why?"
d_ex_toyshop_07_103,These toys would be perfect for the grand finale of our show!
d_ex_toyshop_07_104,Everyone wouldn't be able to take their eyes off of it.
d_ex_toyshop_07_105,We'll take all that you've got.
d_ex_toyshop_07_106,Sure thing!
d_ex_toyshop_07_107,"Noir and Blanc purchases every last toy box in stock,"
d_ex_toyshop_07_108,setting the highest one-day sales record since the toy store's opening.
d_ex_hotel_07_title,Perfect Service
d_ex_hotel_07_1,Welcome.
d_ex_hotel_07_2,"I'm deeply grateful for the invitation, Servant."
d_ex_hotel_07_3,"Ever since I started running Snowfield Hot Spring, my desire has been to enhance the standards of our services."
d_ex_hotel_07_4,"In order to accomplish that, I'm trying to get experiences in all manner of different services."
d_ex_hotel_07_5,"You said this hotel has exceptional service, right?"
d_ex_hotel_07_6,That's right.
d_ex_hotel_07_7,They pride themselves on having the best service in the Outpost.
d_ex_hotel_07_8,That only heightens my anticipation.
d_ex_hotel_07_9,Hmm?
d_ex_hotel_07_10,"This hotel is rather intriguing, but"
d_ex_hotel_07_11,shouldn't there be employees in the lobby?
d_ex_hotel_07_12,"No, there aren't any."
d_ex_hotel_07_13,It's difficult to fathom how they have the best service.
d_ex_hotel_07_14,But I doubt you brought me here to deceive me.
d_ex_hotel_07_15,"So, I shall leave it to you to guide me."
d_ex_hotel_07_16,I lead Ludmilla to the guest room.
d_ex_hotel_07_17,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_07_18,The room is undeniably impeccably organized.
d_ex_hotel_07_19,It's truly immaculate with not a single speck of dust in sight.
d_ex_hotel_07_20,"There must be someone overseeing this place,"
d_ex_hotel_07_21,yet we've not run into any employees this entire time.
d_ex_hotel_07_22,Interesting.
d_ex_hotel_07_23,Does this place offer room service?
d_ex_hotel_07_24,Of course.
d_ex_hotel_07_25,How do we use it?
d_ex_hotel_07_26,*Knock knock*
d_ex_hotel_07_27,Hmmm?
d_ex_hotel_07_28,I think someone's at the door.
d_ex_hotel_07_29,*Swing*
d_ex_hotel_07_30,"There's no one outside,"
d_ex_hotel_07_31,but something's been delivered.
d_ex_hotel_07_32,On the trolley lie several plates covered with silver cloches.
d_ex_hotel_07_33,"As the cloches are lifted, a lavish spread of exquisitely arranged dishes comes into view."
d_ex_hotel_07_34,"Here's a steak with a salad on the side,"
d_ex_hotel_07_35,and even a delightful dessert served with tea for a digestif.
d_ex_hotel_07_36,I presume this is the room service you spoke of.
d_ex_hotel_07_37,"Yes, it is."
d_ex_hotel_07_38,The quality is outstanding.
d_ex_hotel_07_39,They seem to have made it with great care. Shall we have a taste?
d_ex_hotel_07_40,Sure.
d_ex_hotel_07_41,A moment later.
d_ex_hotel_07_42,"Goodness gracious, I'm truly astonished."
d_ex_hotel_07_43,This is absolutely remarkable.
d_ex_hotel_07_44,*Gulp*
d_ex_hotel_07_45,Even the tea has been perfectly prepared.
d_ex_hotel_07_46,I'd love to know exactly what tea leaves were used.
d_ex_hotel_07_47,"Hehe, I find myself growing more pleased with this place."
d_ex_hotel_07_48,"After finishing our meal, Ludmilla proceeds to inspect the bathroom."
d_ex_hotel_07_49,"I thought nothing could surpass the bath products we use at Snowfield,"
d_ex_hotel_07_50,but the ones they have here smell absolutely divine.
d_ex_hotel_07_51,This is a place that you really need to luxuriate in.
d_ex_hotel_07_52,I'll have to bring my squad members here next time.
d_ex_hotel_07_53,It would be unjust for me alone to enjoy such splendid service.
d_ex_hotel_07_54,Are you satisfied with this place?
d_ex_hotel_07_55,Extremely.
d_ex_hotel_07_56,"This hotel spares no effort in catering to its esteemed guests, attending to every detail with unmatched precision."
d_ex_hotel_07_57,I can't tell how pleasant my stay here has been.
d_ex_hotel_07_58,This is a wonderful lesson that I can use for the future.
d_ex_hotel_07_59,I'll see to it that Snowfield Hot Spring brings even greater joy to its visitors.
d_ex_hotel_07_60,Would it be possible to meet the owner of this establishment?
d_ex_hotel_07_61,Hmm... That might be difficult.
d_ex_hotel_07_62,The owner is a very busy individual.
d_ex_hotel_07_63,That's a shame.
d_ex_hotel_07_64,Then can you pass along this for me?
d_ex_hotel_07_65,Ludmilla hands me two small boxes which have been neatly wrapped.
d_ex_hotel_07_66,What's this?
d_ex_hotel_07_67,Bath products and tea leaves used at Snowfield.
d_ex_hotel_07_68,"One is a gift for you, Servant, for spending time with me like this."
d_ex_hotel_07_69,"The other is a gift for the owner, who bestows joy upon all who stays here."
d_ex_hotel_07_70,It wouldn't be polite of me to come here empty-handed.
d_ex_hotel_07_71,"Thanks, I'll pass it along."
d_ex_hotel_07_72,"All right, then. I'll see you next time."
d_ex_hotel_07_73,"Thank you again for today, Servant."
d_ex_hotel_07_74,Ludmilla leaves the room.
d_ex_hotel_07_75,Thank you for such wonderful service.
d_ex_hotel_07_76,"After leaving a note on the tablet in the room along with the gift box, I take my leave."
d_ex_hotel_07_77,A moment later.
d_ex_hotel_07_78,...
d_ex_hotel_07_79,I see they've left behind some useless trinkets...
d_ex_hotel_07_80,...
d_ex_hotel_07_81,*Swish*
d_ex_hotel_07_82,"Before anyone can see her, D snatches the gift and promptly scurries off."
d_ex_tower_07_title,Final Boss
d_ex_tower_07_1,Get 'em! Get 'em!
d_ex_tower_07_2,Take out the final boss!
d_ex_tower_07_3,I receive a string of strange messages from Exia.
d_ex_tower_07_4,She goes on about something called a Coordinated Operation and asks me to go to the Radio Tower ASAP.
d_ex_tower_07_5,"She says it's an emergency, so I drop everything and head straight over."
d_ex_tower_07_6,"Hello there, Survivalist."
d_ex_tower_07_7,Commander? What are you doing here?
d_ex_tower_07_8,"He's a member of our party, that's why."
d_ex_tower_07_9,"Now get 'em, you fools!"
d_ex_tower_07_10,Take down the final boss!
d_ex_tower_07_11,The ensuing events are a bit of a blur.
d_ex_tower_07_12,...
d_ex_tower_07_13,The reason why I was summoned here also remains a mystery.
d_ex_tower_07_14,What exactly did you mean by Coordinated Operation?
d_ex_tower_07_15,This!
d_ex_tower_07_16,Tove hands me a slip of paper.
d_ex_tower_07_17,"The note is faintly redolent of engine oil, and there are a few lines written on it."
d_ex_tower_07_18,The Outpost is in danger.
d_ex_tower_07_19,Target Name: Midas is going to pay a visit.
d_ex_tower_07_20,All personnel are to gather at the Outpost.
d_ex_tower_07_21,Midas?
d_ex_tower_07_22,"Hee hee, the day has finally come."
d_ex_tower_07_23,What are you talking about?
d_ex_tower_07_24,"The day, I, Tove, will finally be recognized by my superiors!"
d_ex_tower_07_25,"Sit back and watch, Survivalist."
d_ex_tower_07_26,"Come and witness the glorious victory of Tove, the one-of-a-kind newbie!"
d_ex_tower_07_27,"Hehe, everyone's gonna be so proud of me."
d_ex_tower_07_28,"Hee hee, hee hee hee..."
d_ex_tower_07_29,Tove starts to fiddle excitedly with the machine next to her.
d_ex_tower_07_30,A tangle of cables protrudes from the machine and runs to a nearby TV and game console.
d_ex_tower_07_31,What is all this?
d_ex_tower_07_32,Th-this is...
d_ex_tower_07_33,our secret weapon.
d_ex_tower_07_34,"With this,"
d_ex_tower_07_35,we no longer...
d_ex_tower_07_36,need to worry about the TV cutting out
d_ex_tower_07_37,and us missing out on our programs.
d_ex_tower_07_38,That's somehow oddly inspiring.
d_ex_tower_07_39,I feel the same way myself.
d_ex_tower_07_40,We've had our heads held under the water for too long.
d_ex_tower_07_41,Now is the time when we rise and unleash all the pent-up rage inside us!
d_ex_tower_07_42,Console failures and other tragedies will now be a thing of the past!
d_ex_tower_07_43,"Now, get 'em, get 'em!"
d_ex_tower_07_44,Defeat the final boss! Defeat the Hands of Minus!
d_ex_tower_07_45,...
d_ex_tower_07_46,I'm starting to see why the Radio Tower has been equipped with such sophisticated machinery.
d_ex_tower_07_47,"Just then, a message comes on."
d_ex_tower_07_48,Incoming message from Maiden...
d_ex_tower_07_49,Wha...?! The Toy Store has been breached!
d_ex_tower_07_50,Amazing! She makes it look so easy.
d_ex_tower_07_51,Let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet.
d_ex_tower_07_52,The Workshop has been taken as well.
d_ex_tower_07_53,Centi is complaining.
d_ex_tower_07_54,Amazing! She makes it look so easy.
d_ex_tower_07_55,Let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet.
d_ex_tower_07_56,Next up is...
d_ex_tower_07_57,The Radio Tower!
d_ex_tower_07_58,Alert! Alert! The final boss has appeared!
d_ex_tower_07_59,It's now or never! We'll fight until our last dying breath!
d_ex_tower_07_60,"Tove starts to operate the machinery, causing various lights on the TV and console to glow. Then..."
d_ex_tower_07_61,Tove? I was looking for you.
d_ex_tower_07_62,Huh? What's this?
d_ex_tower_07_63,... The lights go out.
d_ex_tower_07_64,...
d_ex_tower_07_65,...
d_ex_tower_07_66,...
d_ex_tower_07_67,"After all the build-up, what a let-down."
d_ex_tower_07_68,What are you talking about?
d_ex_tower_07_69,I was cleaning Snowfield Hot Spring when I got a message from Tove. I came over as fast as I could.
d_ex_tower_07_70,Never mind.
d_ex_tower_07_71,...
d_ex_tower_07_72,It's nothing.
d_ex_tower_07_73,Ludmilla quietly looks inside the Radio Tower.
d_ex_tower_07_74,Tove is staring at the machine blankly.
d_ex_tower_07_75,Signal is dejectedly pressing the power button on the TV over and over.
d_ex_tower_07_76,"Meanwhile, Exia is cradling the gaming console with a look of abject terror on her face."
d_ex_tower_07_77,"After taking a survey of her surroundings, Ludmilla sighs."
d_ex_tower_07_78,Is this why you asked me to come?
d_ex_tower_07_79,I was worried that something bad had happened.
d_ex_tower_07_80,"Fortunately, it wasn't anything major."
d_ex_tower_07_81,"Maxwell, all our dreams..."
d_ex_tower_07_82,our hopes... our sweat and toil... they were all in vain.
d_ex_tower_07_83,...
d_ex_tower_07_84,Amazing! You make it look so easy.
d_ex_tower_07_85,Let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet.
d_ex_tower_07_86,A lot is being left unsaid here.
d_ex_tower_07_87,"Game over, man."
d_ex_tower_07_88,But today is the final episode...
d_ex_tower_07_89,We'll have to talk about it another time.
d_ex_tower_07_90,Ludmilla pats Exia and Signal on the back.
d_ex_tower_07_91,"Thus, the Coordinated Operation ended in the alliance's ignominious defeat."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_title,Racing with Timi
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_1,"As I'm walking by the Goddess of Victory statue,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_2,I see Sugar and Epinel standing in the middle of the park.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_3,"Yo, Partner."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_4,Perfect timing.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_5,We need a referee.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_6,A referee? For what?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_7,We're having a race.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_8,"Although, let's be fair, Black Typhoon will win by a country mile."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_9,I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_10,My new board just got an overhaul and it runs faster than ever.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_11,"Also, someone new is throwing their hat in the ring today."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_12,I turn my head to where Epinel and Sugar are staring.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_13,Timi and Leona are walking toward us.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_14,"Oh, hello, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_15,"I can see why Sugar and Epinel would be racing, but Leona?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_16,"Oh,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_17,"I'm not the one racing, it's Timi."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_18,Graul!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_19,I was out for a walk with Timi and stumbled upon these two.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_20,"Once they got a look at Timi, they said they wanted to race him."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_21,"Lions aren't really known for their speed, so I'm not sure if he'll make for a good competitor,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_22,but this is a rare chance for Timi to go full sprint.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_23,That's why we need you to act as a referee.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_24,"Okay, got it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_25,"You've got this, Black Typhoon, just do your thing."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_26,We're gonna leave this newcomer in the dust!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_27,Oh boy...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_28,I can't believe I'm gonna race a lion.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_29,"I'm kinda nervous now, actually."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_30,"Have fun out there, Timi."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_31,Roar!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_32,Ready...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_33,Set...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_34,Go!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_35,Vrooom vrooom!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_36,Off we go!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_37,Roar?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_38,Sugar and Epinel blast off into the distance...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_39,But Timi remains still on the starting line.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_40,Hmm?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_41,"Do you not want to run, Timi?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_42,Roar!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_43,Timi plops down on the ground.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_44,"What do you think the deal is, Zoo Keeper?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_45,"Timi did just have dinner, so maybe he's not up for a lot of physical exertion."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_46,"To be honest, lions tend not to be overly active unless they're hunting."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_47,I feel like we let down Sugar and Epinel just a bit.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_48,It'll be fine. You can explain everything to them when they get back.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_49,Yeah.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_50,After a while.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_51,"The sound of rubber rubbing against gravel slowly swells,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_52,"and before long, Sugar and Epinel appear in unison."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_53,Phew!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_54,Ha...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_55,*Crunch*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_56,Good game.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_57,Looks like I won.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_58,"That was a good race,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_59,but I clearly crossed the finish line first.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_60,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_61,"Partner, you're the referee."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_62,Who got here first?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_63,Both of them look at me expectantly.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_64,"As I dawdle and attempt to buy myself some time to formulate a proper answer,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_65,"Sugar's eyes suddenly dart over to Timi, who is lying on the ground behind me."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_66,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_67,Wait a minute.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_68,Hmm?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_69,No wonder I never saw you!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_70,You...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_71,Graul?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_72,He...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_73,You got here way before us!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_74,This big guy is a real speedster.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_75,"I thought the reason we never saw you was because you were too slow,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_76,"but apparently, it was the other way around."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_77,"Dang, apex predators are no joke."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_78,Graul?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_79,"Hey, Leona."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_80,Yes?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_81,Waddya say we hold more races here?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_82,"Black Typhoon won't accept defeat lying down, and it'll be restless for a while."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_83,I think that's a good idea.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_84,Timi just set a new benchmark for us to strive towards.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_85,"Well, it's just that..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_86,Er...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_87,Timi can only run once a month.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_88,Makes sense.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_89,"If you run at that speed too often, you could end up hurting yourself."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_90,Once a month?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_91,"So we happened to run into him on his racing day, is that it?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_92,Um...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_93,"sure, yeah. Something like that."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_94,"Well, if today's the only day he can race, there's not much we can do."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_95,Can you at least humor us for a while longer today?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_96,Please?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_97,"Haha, sure."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_98,"The three participants kept racing until dark,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_07_99,"but despite the numerous attempts, Sugar and Epinel never won a single time."
d_ex_police_07_title,Judge by Touching
d_ex_police_07_1,*Beep*
d_ex_police_07_2,"Oh, hi, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_police_07_3,??
d_ex_police_07_4,What are you doing here?
d_ex_police_07_5,"Poli said we got another complaint about the shelter, so here I am."
d_ex_police_07_6,"Not long after I got here though, she had to run off to handle some kind of emergency."
d_ex_police_07_7,"In the meantime, something interesting happened while I was waiting."
d_ex_police_07_8,What would that be?
d_ex_police_07_9,I turn to where Leona is pointing.
d_ex_police_07_10,Oh my goodness.
d_ex_police_07_11,When did Poli get so big?
d_ex_police_07_12,Graul?
d_ex_police_07_13,Your hair...
d_ex_police_07_14,You seem to have much more of it than before.
d_ex_police_07_15,Graul?
d_ex_police_07_16,How come all you've been doing is growling?
d_ex_police_07_17,Ah!
d_ex_police_07_18,I think I know why.
d_ex_police_07_19,"You let your hair grow wild,"
d_ex_police_07_20,and now it's suffocating you!
d_ex_police_07_21,"Have no fear,"
d_ex_police_07_22,"I'll save you, Poli!"
d_ex_police_07_23,Quiry rushes over to Timi.
d_ex_police_07_24,Graul!!
d_ex_police_07_25,"Okay, that's far enough."
d_ex_police_07_26,Leona catches Quiry.
d_ex_police_07_27,Huh?
d_ex_police_07_28,"Hello, Quiry."
d_ex_police_07_29,... Leona?
d_ex_police_07_30,"That's Timi, not Poli."
d_ex_police_07_31,Wha... oh my gosh!
d_ex_police_07_32,"I'm so sorry, Timi!"
d_ex_police_07_33,Your fur is just so white and soft like Poli's hair.
d_ex_police_07_34,"Your eyes really are shot, aren't they?"
d_ex_police_07_35,"Yeah,"
d_ex_police_07_36,so I tend to have little mishaps like this.
d_ex_police_07_37,Hmm...
d_ex_police_07_38,Perhaps that means your other senses are more acute.
d_ex_police_07_39,Can you show me your hand?
d_ex_police_07_40,Huh? Okay...
d_ex_police_07_41,Quiry extends her hand to Leona.
d_ex_police_07_42,"Here, feel it."
d_ex_police_07_43,Leona takes Quiry's hand and puts it on Timi's fur.
d_ex_police_07_44,Give it a rub.
d_ex_police_07_45,O-okay!
d_ex_police_07_46,Quiry gently caresses Timi's fur.
d_ex_police_07_47,Wow...
d_ex_police_07_48,Thoughts?
d_ex_police_07_49,It's more coarse than I imagined. But still soft!
d_ex_police_07_50,*Rub*
d_ex_police_07_51,Graul!
d_ex_police_07_52,Timi stretches with no small amount of pride.
d_ex_police_07_53,"Do you want to try, Commander?"
d_ex_police_07_54,"Yeah, come and have a feel, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_police_07_55,Graul!
d_ex_police_07_56,Timi turns his body to my side.
d_ex_police_07_57,...
d_ex_police_07_58,I gently pet Timi's fur.
d_ex_police_07_59,"It is much thicker than I expected, and remarkably soft."
d_ex_police_07_60,This is even softer than Poli's hair.
d_ex_police_07_61,Poli's hair is fluffier.
d_ex_police_07_62,Graul!
d_ex_police_07_63,Timi seems proud.
d_ex_police_07_64,Graul?
d_ex_police_07_65,Timi seems put off.
d_ex_police_07_66,You think so?
d_ex_police_07_67,You should follow Zoo Keeper's lead.
d_ex_police_07_68,"Make sure to get a good feel this time around,"
d_ex_police_07_69,"that way, you won't confuse Timi and Poli again."
d_ex_police_07_70,But...
d_ex_police_07_71,doesn't that mean I'll have to touch Poli's head as well?
d_ex_police_07_72,Yep.
d_ex_police_07_73,Er...
d_ex_police_07_74,Do you think she'll let me do that?
d_ex_police_07_75,Hmm...
d_ex_police_07_76,...
d_ex_police_07_77,...
d_ex_police_07_78,She may get mad.
d_ex_police_07_79,That's what I was thinking.
d_ex_police_07_80,How about distracting her with something that she likes?
d_ex_police_07_81,Let me think...
d_ex_police_07_82,Hmm...
d_ex_police_07_83,"Oh, Commander!"
d_ex_police_07_84,Yes?
d_ex_police_07_85,"No, I mean what she likes is the Commander."
d_ex_police_07_86,I'm sure she'll let you touch her hair.
d_ex_police_07_87,"Great, sounds like a plan."
d_ex_police_07_88,Zoo Keeper can act as our honeypot.
d_ex_police_07_89,Me?
d_ex_police_07_90,"While you draw Poli's attention,"
d_ex_police_07_91,Quiry can get a good feel of her dome.
d_ex_police_07_92,This is a foolproof plan when dealing with skittish critters.
d_ex_police_07_93,Trust me.
d_ex_police_07_94,"Poli isn't an animal, you know..."
d_ex_police_07_95,This is a great idea!
d_ex_police_07_96,"With the Commander helping, I'm sure we can pull this off."
d_ex_police_07_97,Let's do a few practice runs.
d_ex_police_07_98,Timi and I will help you.
d_ex_police_07_99,Graul!
d_ex_police_07_100,"Oh, really? Thanks!"
d_ex_police_07_101,...
d_ex_police_07_102,The motley crew runs a few practice drills until Poli returns back to the Police Station.
d_ex_police_07_103,"When Quiry attempts to pet Poli, however, she evades Quiry's touch with remarkable agility."
d_ex_police_07_104,"Not only does Quiry fail to touch Poli's head, but she also gets an earful from Poli."
d_ex_theater_07_title,Sonata for the Lion
d_ex_theater_07_1,"After receiving a message from Julia, whom I have not heard from in some time, I come to the Theater."
d_ex_theater_07_2,Inside...
d_ex_theater_07_3,Graul!
d_ex_theater_07_4,Leona and Timi are sitting.
d_ex_theater_07_5,??
d_ex_theater_07_6,"Hey, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_theater_07_7,What are you guys doing here?
d_ex_theater_07_8,"Nothing, we are just hanging around."
d_ex_theater_07_9,I can't take Timi to any concerts or theatrical performances back in the Ark.
d_ex_theater_07_10,"So, whenever we want to experience a bit of culture,"
d_ex_theater_07_11,we come over to the Outpost.
d_ex_theater_07_12,"Even though there aren't any shows being put on,"
d_ex_theater_07_13,it's still a nice change of scenery.
d_ex_theater_07_14,... I see.
d_ex_theater_07_15,You don't need to feel sorry for us.
d_ex_theater_07_16,"Sure, it's a shame we don't get to see an actual performance,"
d_ex_theater_07_17,but we've got the entire Theater to ourselves!
d_ex_theater_07_18,We're happy.
d_ex_theater_07_19,"Actually, you might be able to see a performance today."
d_ex_theater_07_20,What?
d_ex_theater_07_21,How?
d_ex_theater_07_22,Hmm?
d_ex_theater_07_23,"I didn't know you'd bring friends,"
d_ex_theater_07_24,Conductor.
d_ex_theater_07_25,Graul?
d_ex_theater_07_26,"Hi, Julia."
d_ex_theater_07_27,"Long time no see, Conductor."
d_ex_theater_07_28,You're as charming as ever.
d_ex_theater_07_29,And who is your friend here with the bestial voice?
d_ex_theater_07_30,"Hey there, my name's Leona."
d_ex_theater_07_31,This big fella over here is Timi.
d_ex_theater_07_32,Graul.
d_ex_theater_07_33,"My my, what a bold and sonorous voice you have."
d_ex_theater_07_34,"Greetings,"
d_ex_theater_07_35,I am Julia.
d_ex_theater_07_36,"Are you here to listen to me bare my soul, like Conductor?"
d_ex_theater_07_37,I don't know about souls and all that. We're just here to appreciate the Theater.
d_ex_theater_07_38,I see. Then I believe our encounter today was predestined.
d_ex_theater_07_39,Maybe so.
d_ex_theater_07_40,How wonderful!
d_ex_theater_07_41,I shall take this joy I am feeling and give it a voice through my music.
d_ex_theater_07_42,Your music?
d_ex_theater_07_43,Are you a musician?
d_ex_theater_07_44,Yes. I give voice to my soul through the violin.
d_ex_theater_07_45,"Wow, cool!"
d_ex_theater_07_46,"Actually,"
d_ex_theater_07_47,Timi has never seen a recital or anything before.
d_ex_theater_07_48,Would it be possible for you to play a song for us?
d_ex_theater_07_49,Of course.
d_ex_theater_07_50,I would be honored to play for an intrepid lion such as him.
d_ex_theater_07_51,Do you have any preference?
d_ex_theater_07_52,Anything will do.
d_ex_theater_07_53,"What about you, Conductor?"
d_ex_theater_07_54,I'll leave it up to you.
d_ex_theater_07_55,Very well. I hope my pleasure of meeting you all shines through in my melody.
d_ex_theater_07_56,A concerto...
d_ex_theater_07_57,Julia picks up her violin.
d_ex_theater_07_58,for the intrepid lion.
d_ex_theater_07_59,Graul!
d_ex_theater_07_60,Julia closes her eyes and begins to play.
d_ex_theater_07_61,"The dulcet tones produced by the strings resonate sonorously through the Theater, much like the stentorian roar of a lion."
d_ex_theater_07_62,"Once the final note has faded, Julia puts down her violin."
d_ex_theater_07_63,Graul!
d_ex_theater_07_64,"Timi roars at Julia, as if applauding her performance."
d_ex_theater_07_65,Looks like Timi enjoyed it.
d_ex_theater_07_66,And that makes two of us. I've never heard such a powerful piece of music!
d_ex_theater_07_67,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
d_ex_theater_07_68,How about another?
d_ex_theater_07_69,Graul!
d_ex_theater_07_70,Sure!
d_ex_theater_07_71,"Julia launches into another piece, this time a sonata,"
d_ex_theater_07_72,"and the sounds of the violin, dedicated to the lion, echo throughout the Theater."
d_ex_modernbar_06_title,What Makes a Good Drink?
d_ex_modernbar_06_1,*Ring*
d_ex_modernbar_06_2,"Hello, Mister."
d_ex_modernbar_06_3,"Hey, Cadet!"
d_ex_modernbar_06_4,What brings you here?
d_ex_modernbar_06_5,Why else would he be here?
d_ex_modernbar_06_6,To have a drink.
d_ex_modernbar_06_7,"Are you two here to grab some, too?"
d_ex_modernbar_06_8,"Yeah, Rosanna invited us."
d_ex_modernbar_06_9,She tried the drink I was having
d_ex_modernbar_06_10,"and said I should be having something better,"
d_ex_modernbar_06_11,so she's whipping me up something personally.
d_ex_modernbar_06_12,I didn't expect Rosanna to care about me so much!
d_ex_modernbar_06_13,That's not why I'm making you a drink.
d_ex_modernbar_06_14,Huh? It's not?
d_ex_modernbar_06_15,"Of course not,"
d_ex_modernbar_06_16,you nincompoop.
d_ex_modernbar_06_17,"It's simply that as an alcohol connoisseur, I couldn't stand and watch you drink such mop water."
d_ex_modernbar_06_18,"I felt embarrassed for you,"
d_ex_modernbar_06_19,so I wanted to show you what real drinks should taste like.
d_ex_modernbar_06_20,"Would you like to try some too, Mister?"
d_ex_modernbar_06_21,I like to consider myself an amateur mixologist.
d_ex_modernbar_06_22,"Sure, I'll try some."
d_ex_modernbar_06_23,Rosanna begins to mix the drinks with a series of flamboyant hand motions.
d_ex_modernbar_06_24,"Wow, she really takes this seriously."
d_ex_modernbar_06_25,So professional.
d_ex_modernbar_06_26,It's certainly fascinating to watch.
d_ex_modernbar_06_27,*Tap*
d_ex_modernbar_06_28,"Here, you try yours first, Mister."
d_ex_modernbar_06_29,"In front of me, Rosanna places a cocktail glass containing a dark brown liquid."
d_ex_modernbar_06_30,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_31,What do you think?
d_ex_modernbar_06_32,It's a bit bitter...
d_ex_modernbar_06_33,It has a very refined taste.
d_ex_modernbar_06_34,Really?
d_ex_modernbar_06_35,You seem to prefer less bold flavors.
d_ex_modernbar_06_36,Duly noted.
d_ex_modernbar_06_37,That's precisely what I was going for.
d_ex_modernbar_06_38,I knew you'd have good taste.
d_ex_modernbar_06_39,A quality cocktail like this isn't wasted on you.
d_ex_modernbar_06_40,*Tap*
d_ex_modernbar_06_41,This one's for you.
d_ex_modernbar_06_42,Thanks!
d_ex_modernbar_06_43,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_44,Poooooooooooooof!!
d_ex_modernbar_06_45,*Cough cough*
d_ex_modernbar_06_46,What is this? It tastes awful!
d_ex_modernbar_06_47,What?
d_ex_modernbar_06_48,Are your taste buds broken or something?
d_ex_modernbar_06_49,It's bitter as all get out.
d_ex_modernbar_06_50,Why would anyone drink this?
d_ex_modernbar_06_51,"Let me try yours, Cadet."
d_ex_modernbar_06_52,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_53,Pooooof!
d_ex_modernbar_06_54,This one's terrible too!
d_ex_modernbar_06_55,"That's it, step aside."
d_ex_modernbar_06_56,Moran pushes Rosanna to the side and steps behind the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_06_57,Don't tell me you're planning on making your own?
d_ex_modernbar_06_58,You bet your behind I am!
d_ex_modernbar_06_59,And it's gonna be delicious.
d_ex_modernbar_06_60,It better be.
d_ex_modernbar_06_61,"Moran samples the different alcohols and mixers that are available, and then starts mixing them."
d_ex_modernbar_06_62,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_63,"Blech, so sour."
d_ex_modernbar_06_64,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_65,That's more like it!
d_ex_modernbar_06_66,*Tap*
d_ex_modernbar_06_67,"All done, have a try."
d_ex_modernbar_06_68,The drink Moran slides our way has a vivid color.
d_ex_modernbar_06_69,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_70,Well?
d_ex_modernbar_06_71,It's very sweet and fruity.
d_ex_modernbar_06_72,It's almost cloyingly sweet...
d_ex_modernbar_06_73,As it should.
d_ex_modernbar_06_74,I made it by mixing all the different fruit-flavored liqueurs together.
d_ex_modernbar_06_75,This kind of flavor is more my speed.
d_ex_modernbar_06_76,Really?
d_ex_modernbar_06_77,Maybe I should have used more bitter liqueurs.
d_ex_modernbar_06_78,I tried to make a drink that I knew I'd like.
d_ex_modernbar_06_79,Hmm...
d_ex_modernbar_06_80,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_81,Blech!
d_ex_modernbar_06_82,Hey! What are you spitting it out for?
d_ex_modernbar_06_83,I knew this would happen.
d_ex_modernbar_06_84,This tastes like a kid's drink.
d_ex_modernbar_06_85,Who in the world would want something this sugary when they want a stiff drink?
d_ex_modernbar_06_86,There's not an ounce of depth to this thing.
d_ex_modernbar_06_87,Now beat it.
d_ex_modernbar_06_88,Rosanna yanks Moran out from behind the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_06_89,"I'll mix another drink, just wait."
d_ex_modernbar_06_90,"As the hours go on, the two continue their cocktail confrontation."
d_ex_modernbar_06_91,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_92,Blech! It's still so bitter!
d_ex_modernbar_06_93,How do you expect anyone to ever drink this?
d_ex_modernbar_06_94,*Gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_06_95,This tastes like I'm gargling with sugar water!
d_ex_modernbar_06_96,It's an insult to the very concept of alcohol.
d_ex_modernbar_06_97,...
d_ex_modernbar_06_98,I decide to leave these two to their drink-based battle and head out.
d_ex_court_06_title,Uh-huh
d_ex_court_06_1,"My work is done for the day, and I'm heading back to my room."
d_ex_court_06_2,I'll tell you one thing. The Peony Association would never engage in any thuggish behavior.
d_ex_court_06_3,That's why I take such pride in my line of work.
d_ex_court_06_4,We're different from ordinary no-good delinquents.
d_ex_court_06_5,Uh-huh.
d_ex_court_06_6,"On the way, I see Admi and Moran talking."
d_ex_court_06_7,"Or rather, I see Moran talking at Admi."
d_ex_court_06_8,And...
d_ex_court_06_9,I like the Courthouse.
d_ex_court_06_10,Wanna know why?
d_ex_court_06_11,...
d_ex_court_06_12,Admi's eyes are glazed over.
d_ex_court_06_13,"If I get involved, I might end up getting stuck listening to Moran's long-winded story as well."
d_ex_court_06_14,Should I stay back for the moment?
d_ex_court_06_15,The Courthouse is the last bastion of justice and righteousness.
d_ex_court_06_16,"During my time working in the underworld, I've decided there are some lines that I will never cross."
d_ex_court_06_17,Do you want to know what one of them is?
d_ex_court_06_18,To not do anything in flagrant disregard of the law.
d_ex_court_06_19,Only by doing that can you lead a respectable life. That's what I believe.
d_ex_court_06_20,Uh-huh.
d_ex_court_06_21,Isn't it hard to work at the Courthouse?
d_ex_court_06_22,"It is nice, but working there seems tough!"
d_ex_court_06_23,I heard that Rosanna had come here a few days ago.
d_ex_court_06_24,"What was it for again... defamation, maybe?"
d_ex_court_06_25,??
d_ex_court_06_26,Uh-huh.
d_ex_court_06_27,???
d_ex_court_06_28,"At any rate, working at the Courthouse seems like a sweet gig."
d_ex_court_06_29,Only the best of the best can work here.
d_ex_court_06_30,"Oooh, that reminds me."
d_ex_court_06_31,Has there ever been a case where someone sued their own squad?
d_ex_court_06_32,Is that something you can do at the Courthouse? Or do you have to do that at the Police Station?
d_ex_court_06_33,Uh-huh.
d_ex_court_06_34,What?
d_ex_court_06_35,Oh! Er... sorry.
d_ex_court_06_36,What did you say?
d_ex_court_06_37,I was thinking of something else.
d_ex_court_06_38,"It's okay, that can happen!"
d_ex_court_06_39,"I was asking if you wanted to sue a member of your squad, where would you go?"
d_ex_court_06_40,Would that be under the Courthouse's jurisdiction?
d_ex_court_06_41,"One of my squad members is always giving me a hard time, and I want to scare her a bit."
d_ex_court_06_42,"Um, I think you'd have to direct that type of question to Yulha and Privaty..."
d_ex_court_06_43,"Okay, then I'll come back later."
d_ex_court_06_44,...
d_ex_court_06_45,"I may be imagining things, but Admi's complexion seems to grow slightly more ashen at this."
d_ex_court_06_46,"Thanks, Admi."
d_ex_court_06_47,"Anyway, I've gotta go back to work."
d_ex_court_06_48,"I just popped in since I had some spare time, but I've gotta get back. This was fun!"
d_ex_court_06_49,See ya.
d_ex_court_06_50,"Uh, yeah... bye."
d_ex_court_06_51,"Moran leaves the Courthouse, looking elated."
d_ex_court_06_52,Phew...
d_ex_court_06_53,"Finally, it's over... what was that, 5 hours?"
d_ex_court_06_54,"Exhausted from Moran's non-stop talking, Admi collapses over her desk."
d_ex_court_06_55,Are you okay?
d_ex_court_06_56,!!
d_ex_court_06_57,Commander?
d_ex_court_06_58,When did you get here?
d_ex_court_06_59,I passed by and saw you talking to Moran.
d_ex_court_06_60,Uh-huh.
d_ex_court_06_61,...
d_ex_court_06_62,"Oh, sorry. I've been saying nothing but ""Uh-huh"" for the past few hours... guess I can't shake it."
d_ex_court_06_63,It's okay.
d_ex_court_06_64,Is Moran usually that chatty?
d_ex_court_06_65,"It was fun when we first started talking,"
d_ex_court_06_66,but then I realized she wasn't ever going to stop.
d_ex_court_06_67,"Even when I tried to wrap up the conversation, she'd just bring up something new to talk about."
d_ex_court_06_68,"At this point, I even know what color underwear she wears."
d_ex_court_06_69,I've never seen someone so loquacious in my life.
d_ex_court_06_70,...
d_ex_court_06_71,I listen to Admi vent for a while longer.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_title,Dogs' Loyalty
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_1,"If someone tried to lure you away from Biscuit with treats,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_2,what would you do?

d_ex_wingofvictory_07_4,Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_5,"Hehe, they said they wouldn't think about leaving me for a second."

d_ex_wingofvictory_07_11,"Hey, you two."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_12,"Hey, Trainer."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_13,What brings you here?
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_14,I just went out for a little walk.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_15,"Hey, Cadet."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_16,Same here. I was taking a walk when I ran into Biscuit and her furry friends.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_17,I was testing how loyal they are.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_18,"Loyalty training, you could call it."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_19,I didn't realize such training existed.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_20,"Thanks to Moran, my doggies are more trustworthy than ever."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_21,Glad to help!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_22,"Actually,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_23,I was just about to move onto practical training.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_24,"Any chance you could give me a hand, Cadet?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_25,How can I help?
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_26,Moran comes up to me and whispers into my ear.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_27,Use these sweet potato treats
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_28,to tempt the dogs.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_29,"If they stay by Biscuit, then they pass."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_30,"If they come to you, then they fail."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_31,I'm willing to bet they'll make a beeline straight for me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_32,And I say they'll stick by Biscuit.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_33,Dogs are extremely loyal animals.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_34,Give it a shot.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_35,Okay.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_36,"I approach the dogs, who are playing with Biscuit."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_37,"Hey fellas, look at this."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_38,"Come over here, and I'll give you a nice little treat."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_39,I shake the sweet potato-flavored treats in an attempt to entice the dogs.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_40,Grrrr...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_41,"Max sits down and glares at me, not budging an inch."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_42,Very nice! Max is as loyal as they come.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_43,... Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_44,*Tadadak*
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_45,!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_46,The other dogs all make a mad rush for me and the treat I'm holding...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_47,... as does Biscuit.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_48,"Biscuit, what are you doing?!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_49,"Oh, s-sorry."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_50,I kinda lost myself there for a second.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_51,This can't be!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_52,Guess these guys need a few more lessons on loyalty.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_53,Nobody can resist sweet potato treats.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_54,These fellas are still puppies. They might be too young for all this.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_55,"Max didn't move at all, though! Hehe."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_56,I refrain from asking Biscuit
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_57,why she herself wasn't able to resist.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_58,"No, we can do this."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_59,This only happened because it was our first attempt.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_60,Let's start from the beginning and go over the training again.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_61,"Loyalty is an important attribute to have, both for animals and humans alike."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_62,Moran continues to teach the puppies about loyalty.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_63,A few hours later...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_64,"Okay, give it another shot, Cadet."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_65,"Moran looks at me, brimming with confidence."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_66,Okay.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_67,I approach Biscuit and the dogs.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_68,*Swish swish*
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_69,"Hey fellas, check this out."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_70,"If you come here, I've got three treats for each of you."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_71,I once again tempt the dogs with the sweet potato treats.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_72,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_73,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_74,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_75,"In stark contrast to the previous effort, both the dogs and Biscuit remain firmly in place."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_76,"They are all, however, drooling quite heavily."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_77,"Three minutes later,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_78,"all the dogs are still in their original spots, firmly beside Biscuit."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_79,Amazing.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_80,Told you!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_81,Nothing is impossible.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_82,"Very good, everyone. You've officially passed the test."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_83,"You've all earned your sweet potato treats, so help yourselves."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_84,Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_85,Bark bark!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_86,The dogs rush towards the treats that I'm holding.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_87,"Hehe, delicious."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_88,... Biscuit included.
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_89,"No matter what happens, you must never allow your loyalty to waver, okay?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_90,"You have to protect your master, Biscuit."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_91,Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_92,Bark bark!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_93,"The same goes for you too, Biscuit. You're their owner and you need to protect them as well."
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_94,Got it!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_95,"Now, for the last time, let me hear you say ""loyalty""!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_96,Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_97,Woof woof! Woof woof! Woof woof!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_98,Loyalty! Woof! Loyalty! Woof! Hehehe!
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_99,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_07_100,"Biscuit, the dogs, and Moran all eat the treats while chanting ""loyalty"" for an inordinately long time."
d_ex_court_07_title,Privaty's Responsibilities
d_ex_court_07_1,*Knock knock*
d_ex_court_07_2,"Admi, handle the third sheet of the file I sent."
d_ex_court_07_3,Okay.
d_ex_court_07_4,*Knock knock*
d_ex_court_07_5,"I just sent you a file, Newbie. Take a look when you get a chance."
d_ex_court_07_6,"It's an event log, which I've organized in chronological order."
d_ex_court_07_7,Got it.
d_ex_court_07_8,"Don't forget, the trial starts in two hours..."
d_ex_court_07_9,*Bang*
d_ex_court_07_10,"Hold up,"
d_ex_court_07_11,"what's all this about, Yulha?"
d_ex_court_07_12,"What else, if not work?"
d_ex_court_07_13,"I can see that,"
d_ex_court_07_14,but why is Master doing my job for me?
d_ex_court_07_15,...
d_ex_court_07_16,...
d_ex_court_07_17,...
d_ex_court_07_18,Wh-what?
d_ex_court_07_19,Why are you all looking at me like that?
d_ex_court_07_20,I can hardly believe my own ears.
d_ex_court_07_21,What did I say?
d_ex_court_07_22,Er...
d_ex_court_07_23,"... You said ""Master""."
d_ex_court_07_24,!!!
d_ex_court_07_25,O-oh my gosh!
d_ex_court_07_26,Did I?
d_ex_court_07_27,H-how could I possibly...!
d_ex_court_07_28,Allow me to make things clear.
d_ex_court_07_29,This trial does not require a maid.
d_ex_court_07_30,"Newbie also informed me that you'd be at the cafe during the trial,"
d_ex_court_07_31,so my hands are tied.
d_ex_court_07_32,"Oh... Um, I guess..."
d_ex_court_07_33,"I can notify the cafe and leave for a bit, no problem!"
d_ex_court_07_34,What difference does that make?
d_ex_court_07_35,... What?
d_ex_court_07_36,"You wouldn't have time to pore over the files with that cafe job,"
d_ex_court_07_37,or even concentrate on anything at the cafe when your mind's all tangled up in the trial.
d_ex_court_07_38,"And once the trial began, thoughts of unfinished tasks at the cafe would hinder your concentration."
d_ex_court_07_39,It's impossible to juggle both at the same time.
d_ex_court_07_40,...
d_ex_court_07_41,"We're well aware of how hard you've been working, Privaty,"
d_ex_court_07_42,so we didn't want to trouble you with this.
d_ex_court_07_43,"Given the relatively small scale of the trial, we decided to seek the Commander's assistance."
d_ex_court_07_44,But...!
d_ex_court_07_45,You just concentrate on handling things over at the cafe.
d_ex_court_07_46,"Once you've got everything sorted out over there, you can come back here."
d_ex_court_07_47,!!
d_ex_court_07_48,... Okay.
d_ex_court_07_49,I got it.
d_ex_court_07_50,Master!!
d_ex_court_07_51,Yes?
d_ex_court_07_52,"I can't say I completely trust you, but..."
d_ex_court_07_53,just try not to
d_ex_court_07_54,"tarnish Triangle's reputation during this trial, okay?"
d_ex_court_07_55,"Otherwise, I'll add extra chili sauce to your omurice!"
d_ex_court_07_56,*Bang*
d_ex_court_07_57,"It seems she's holding her own at the cafe,"
d_ex_court_07_58,wouldn't you say?
d_ex_court_07_59,...
d_ex_court_07_60,Back to the trial.
d_ex_court_07_61,"It's set to start in two hours, so everybody get ready."
d_ex_court_07_62,Yes.
d_ex_court_07_63,Got it.
d_ex_court_07_64,"We successfully concluded the trial, and the remainder of the day proceeded smoothly."
d_ex_court_07_65,"Later that day, my omurice is fortunately topped with ketchup, not chili sauce."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_title,Ketchup Training!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_1,"Cocoa, Privaty, and I arrive at the park where the Goddess of Victory statue is located."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_2,We are here to carry out some ketchup training for Privaty.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_3,I came ready for today's training.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_4,Look what I've got: watery ketchup!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_5,Watery ketchup?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_6,"Yeah, I poured some water into this bottle."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_7,"So, if you give it a little squeeze..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_8,*Whoosh*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_9,Water's gonna come out just like that.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_10,You can use it to doodle on the ground.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_11,"The water dries up quickly, so there're lots of places to draw."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_12,Aren't I brilliant?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_13,"Does this even count as training, though?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_14,"I mean, this feels completely different from ketchup, doesn't it?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_15,Only poor craftsmen blame their tools.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_16,"Yeah, but... they're kind of different, you know..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_17,Fine.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_18,I'll do my best.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_19,Very well!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_20,"All righty then, Master, when I give the signal, go ahead and swipe the tablet screen to reveal a word."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_21,"Then, Privaty, you gotta draw that word on the ground."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_22,"Fine, I get it..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_23,Okay!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_24,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_25,Tip number one to painting with ketchup:
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_26,Be as fast as the wind!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_27,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_28,"C'mon, repeat after me!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_29,B-be as fast as the wind!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_30,"Cocoa gives me a signal,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_31,and I swipe the tablet screen to reveal a word.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_32,"I'm gonna count to 10, and you have to write that word all pretty-like, got it?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_33,G-got it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_34,Ready...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_35,Go!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_36,"With a dramatic flourish, Privaty vigorously shakes the ketchup bottle filled with water."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_37,"As she squirts the water onto the ground, dark watermarks start to gather and coalesce."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_38,... Time's up!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_39,Please stop!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_40,Phew...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_41,"I'd say that was pretty speedy, wouldn't you?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_42,Um...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_43,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_44,What's on the ground is an incomprehensible scribble.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_45,Er...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_46,"I-it's a word, in case you didn't notice!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_47,This darn water just keeps spreading and makes it impossible to make anything out.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_48,It'd look a lot better if I were drawing a simple pattern or something.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_49,If you say so.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_50,"All right, Master, onto the next one."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_51,All right.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_52,I swipe on the tablet
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_53,to reveal an image of an adorable kitten.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_54,Tip number two to painting with ketchup:
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_55,Keep it simple and cute!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_56,Keep it simple and cute!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_57,"Maids should be able to draw a variety of cute and simple images,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_58,"like this kitty here, to keep the masters happy."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_59,... Isn't it enough to just look at the character and draw?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_60,What kind of person would want us to replicate a real-life photo with ketchup?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_61,Don't think like that!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_62,"If you just keep drawing cute images while looking at the characters all the time, you won't get any better, you know?!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_63,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_64,"Fine, I'll give it a shot."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_65,That's the spirit!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_66,"Ready, set..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_67,Go!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_68,"Privaty does her best to create a pleasing image with the ketchup bottle,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_69,"but she struggles with controlling it, and all she manages to produce are disagreeable blots and spots."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_70,"Before I know it, the entire park floor is covered in water stains."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_71,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_72,Hmm...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_73,I knew it's not something we can accomplish in one shot.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_74,Let's call it a day and continue another time.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_75,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_76,Let me do it one last time.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_77,"Looking at the increasingly desperate Privaty,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_78,I carefully switch off the tablet.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_79,"Forget about this picture, Privaty,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_80,and draw a cat the way you want to.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_81,But that defeats the entire point of this training!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_82,"Forget it,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_83,just draw whatever you want since it's the last one.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_84,Just do it slow.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_85,... Okay.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_86,Phew...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_87,"Privaty shakes the bottle, then proceeds to carefully squeeze out the water little by little."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_88,"Although her speed is noticeably slower than before, an exquisite drawing begins to take shape on the ground."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_89,Mmm...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_90,Done!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_91,Hmm...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_92,Let's not worry about the end result for now.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_93,The thing is that you took waaay too long.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_94,"At this rate, most masters would lose their patience and leave by now."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_95,Man... I guess I'm just not cut out for this stuff.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_96,Not so fast.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_97,Take a good look.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_98,"The cat you drew is positively adorable, and even resembles you in many ways."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_99,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_100,"What do you think, Master?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_101,"A cat is drawn on the ground, exuding a fiery personality. Its cute appearance is accentuated by smooth lines."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_102,"Very cute, and pleasing to the eye."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_103,R-really?!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_104,You bet!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_105,"If you were just a tad faster, it would've been perfect!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_106,"All right, that concludes today's training!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_107,Ah...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_108,"It wasn't a bad time, I suppose."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_109,"I mean, it's probably because I'm just naturally good at it."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_110,Can you draw this cat on my omurice when we head back to the cafe?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_111,Ahem... I guess there's no helping it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_112,"If that's what you want, Master."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_113,"On our way back, we stopped by the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_114,"Although it took a while,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_08_115,I got to enjoy some omurice with Privaty's unique cat drawn on it.
d_ex_trainstation_07_title,The Competent Maid
d_ex_trainstation_07_1,I arrive at the train station at Diesel's call.
d_ex_trainstation_07_2,"Ah! Welcome, Commander!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_3,Over here.
d_ex_trainstation_07_4,Sorry to call you so suddenly.
d_ex_trainstation_07_5,No worries. What's up?
d_ex_trainstation_07_6,Um... We're planning to clean up the AZX and the station.
d_ex_trainstation_07_7,"It's gonna be a lot of work, so..."
d_ex_trainstation_07_8,"I know it's a bit much, but, could you possibly lend us a hand?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_9,"Sure, but it depends on the workload."
d_ex_trainstation_07_10,"Besides cleaning the AZX's interior, we've also got to clean the wheels!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_11,Is this reasonable?
d_ex_trainstation_07_12,Is all that cleaning really necessary?
d_ex_trainstation_07_13,I don't really see why we have to do it either.
d_ex_trainstation_07_14,"We just heard that someone higher up wanted to inspect the AZX,"
d_ex_trainstation_07_15,"so we got orders to clean it up real nice, and make it look brand new."
d_ex_trainstation_07_16,Can we manage it on our own?
d_ex_trainstation_07_17,"Brid is busy with other repairs, so that's why I called in the cleaning master!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_18,"Hehe! Great idea, Soline!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_19,Hehe.
d_ex_trainstation_07_20,Cleaning master?
d_ex_trainstation_07_21,Yep!
d_ex_trainstation_07_22,Speak of the devil...
d_ex_trainstation_07_23,*Click clack*
d_ex_trainstation_07_24,Here she comes.
d_ex_trainstation_07_25,A familiar silhouette draws near from a distance.
d_ex_trainstation_07_26,It is none other than a certain someone from Maid For You.
d_ex_trainstation_07_27,Hmm?
d_ex_trainstation_07_28,Huh?
d_ex_trainstation_07_29,"Oh, um..."
d_ex_trainstation_07_30,"Hello, ladies!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_31,"I-I'm Privaty, and I'll be your maid for the day!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_32,"Whether it's cooking or cleaning, I can do i..."
d_ex_trainstation_07_33,Huh?!
d_ex_trainstation_07_34,...
d_ex_trainstation_07_35,M-Master?
d_ex_trainstation_07_36,What are you doing here?
d_ex_trainstation_07_37,They roped me in to help with cleaning as well.
d_ex_trainstation_07_38,Good grief.
d_ex_trainstation_07_39,"We asked for a cleaning master, but they sent Privaty of all people?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_40,"I gotta admit the outfit looks really good on you, hehe."
d_ex_trainstation_07_41,My goodness...
d_ex_trainstation_07_42,"You're a maid now, Privaty?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_43,Y-yeah!
d_ex_trainstation_07_44,You got a problem with that?!
d_ex_trainstation_07_45,There's no need to get so upset!
d_ex_trainstation_07_46,"I was just a little caught off guard, that's all."
d_ex_trainstation_07_47,So... are you any good at cleaning?
d_ex_trainstation_07_48,"Hmph, of course!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_49,... I'm not convinced.
d_ex_trainstation_07_50,Come again?
d_ex_trainstation_07_51,"Look, let's be real here."
d_ex_trainstation_07_52,"We specifically asked for a cleaning master, and out of nowhere, you showed up."
d_ex_trainstation_07_53,"You don't exactly scream cleaning master, do you?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_54,Hey!
d_ex_trainstation_07_55,You better think again.
d_ex_trainstation_07_56,I'll show you just how skilled I am at cleaning.
d_ex_trainstation_07_57,You want this place to be immaculate? You got it!
d_ex_trainstation_07_58,Privaty strides off with her cleaning tools.
d_ex_trainstation_07_59,"What's all the fuss about, seriously?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_60,Did I say anything wrong?
d_ex_trainstation_07_61,Not at all.
d_ex_trainstation_07_62,"Anyway, it looks like she's started cleaning. Should we join her?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_63,Sure.
d_ex_trainstation_07_64,Let's dive right in!
d_ex_trainstation_07_65,"By divvying up the cleaning duties,"
d_ex_trainstation_07_66,we end up finishing earlier than expected.
d_ex_trainstation_07_67,"Phew, finally done!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_68,"Thanks a bunch, everyone!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_69,Big shoutout to Privaty for extra effort!
d_ex_trainstation_07_70,*Huff huff*
d_ex_trainstation_07_71,Huh? Me?
d_ex_trainstation_07_72,"I mean, you practically cleaned the entire AZX all by yourself."
d_ex_trainstation_07_73,"So, I can't thank you enough!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_74,"Oh, that?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_75,Piece of cake.
d_ex_trainstation_07_76,I was wondering if we could trouble you with the next cleaning as well?
d_ex_trainstation_07_77,"Wait, what?"
d_ex_trainstation_07_78,Y-you'd want to invite me back?
d_ex_trainstation_07_79,Yeah.
d_ex_trainstation_07_80,"I didn't realize you were so good at cleaning,"
d_ex_trainstation_07_81,and such a reliable helper as well.
d_ex_trainstation_07_82,Exactly!
d_ex_trainstation_07_83,"Oh, I don't want to put any pressure on you."
d_ex_trainstation_07_84,You're more than welcome to decline. No hard feelings.
d_ex_trainstation_07_85,... I didn't say I wasn't interested.
d_ex_trainstation_07_86,I'm just glad that you all have noticed my capabilities.
d_ex_trainstation_07_87,Feel free to call me if you ever need help.
d_ex_trainstation_07_88,"After all, it's my duty as a maid to serve you."
d_ex_trainstation_07_89,That's great!
d_ex_trainstation_07_90,Thanks!
d_ex_trainstation_07_91,"Thanks for the help as well, Soline, Commander!"
d_ex_trainstation_07_92,"With that, we leave the now gleaming Train Station."
d_ex_trainstation_07_93,"Everyone's saying that whenever it's time to clean the Train Station, Privaty always comes by and pitches in without fail."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_title,A Dilemma
d_ex_clothingstore_07_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_clothingstore_07_2,Master!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_3,You're finally here!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_4,"That's great, hehe!"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_5,"Hello, Master."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_6,"I know we called you over on short notice, so thanks for coming over to help."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_7,Don't mention it.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_8,"So, what were you up to around here, anyway?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_9,We'll be hosting an event called 'Maids in Everyday Life' at the cafe next week.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_10,"On that day, we're expected to be dressed in casual outfits."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_11,"So, we've been trying to purchase suitable attire for the event."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_12,Ta-da!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_13,"The top is loose-fitting, with just the right amount of skin peeking through."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_14,"As for the bottom half, I'm going with a skirt."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_15,Do you think it'll look good on me?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_16,I think you'll look gorgeous.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_17,Hehe. Really?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_18,Ade picked them for me!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_19,"What did you get for yourself, Ade?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_20,"Actually, about that…"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_21,"Let me guess... You still haven't found the perfect outfit, right?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_22,"It's not that. Quite the opposite, in fact."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_23,"Personally, I found them quite similar,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_24,"but Soda opined that certain pieces complemented me exceptionally well, so I find myself in quite a dilemma."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_25,"So, I was hoping to seek your opinion on which one you think looks best."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_26,I see...
d_ex_clothingstore_07_27,It's true!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_28,"Anyways, I've somehow managed to narrow it down to two outfits..."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_29,but I just can't seem to decide between the two!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_30,"Help us take a look, Master!"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_31,The first outfit is a tight-fitting top with a short skirt
d_ex_clothingstore_07_32,and knee-high boots.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_33,Are you sure that goes well with Ade's image?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_34,Let me tell you something!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_35,Ade looks totally different when she lets down her hair.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_36,"So, I thought it'd be fun to show everyone a new side of Ade..."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_37,I see...
d_ex_clothingstore_07_38,The second option is a dress that shares a similar style with our current maid outfit.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_39,But the main difference lies in its much lighter color and different material.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_40,I believe sneakers would complement this beautifully.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_41,What do you think about me tying up a ponytail?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_42,Hmm…
d_ex_clothingstore_07_43,Don't you think both suit her very well?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_44,I'm getting so excited just thinking about it!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_45,Hmm...
d_ex_clothingstore_07_46,"Well, Master,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_47,which of these attires do you find more befitting for the occasion?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_48,"The first outfit really brings out an entirely different side of Ade,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_49,while the second one makes her look very elegant and refined.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_50,…
d_ex_clothingstore_07_51,The first outfit!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_52,The second outfit!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_53,"Before I decide, can you take off your glasses?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_54,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_55,It's quite the departure from my usual style. I believe our customers will find it quite refreshing.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_56,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_57,It's quite likely our customers will appreciate a more familiar appearance.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_58,Pardon?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_59,Why the sudden interest in my glasses?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_60,"We're right in the middle of picking out clothes, so why don't you choose your favorite, Master!"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_61,"With a tinge of sadness, I begin to ponder which outfit I prefer again."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_62,The first outfit.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_63,The second outfit.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_64,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_65,It's quite the departure from my usual style. I believe our customers will find it quite refreshing.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_66,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_67,It's quite likely our customers will appreciate a more familiar appearance.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_68,"It appears we're settling on this attire. Would it be acceptable to you, Soda?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_69,"Aw man… I really had my eyes on the other one,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_70,"but hey, can't really help it, right?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_71,"Well, that's a shame..."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_72,What can we do about this?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_73,Why can't you just wear both?
d_ex_clothingstore_07_74,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_75,"My goodness, you're right!"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_76,There's truly no need for me to be dressed in the same attire all day long.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_77,I can wear one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
d_ex_clothingstore_07_78,"Master,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_79,you truly are a genius!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_80,"With that, our dilemma has been resolved."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_81,"Thank you, Master."
d_ex_clothingstore_07_82,"You'll be coming to the event, won't you?"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_83,We're both looking forward to seeing you there!
d_ex_clothingstore_07_84,"After wrapping up our enjoyable shopping trip,"
d_ex_clothingstore_07_85,I find myself eagerly anticipating the Maids in Everyday Life event.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_title,Becoming a Regular
d_ex_maidcafe_08_1,"One peaceful afternoon,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_2,"I find myself spending a relaxing time at the Maid Cafe, when..."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_3,*Jingle*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_4,"So, this is the place they keep blabbering about."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_5,The one with coffee supposedly sweeter than Sugar Coffee.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_6,"This is it, all right!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_7,The place that has coffee creamier than Milk Coffee.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_8,"Welcome, Miss Sugar and Miss Milk."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_9,Please take a seat wherever you desire.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_10,An unsettling tension starts to envelop the cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_11,What brings you two here?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_12,"Our cafe's sales are in the dumps, but we heard this place is raking it in."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_13,Thought we'd swing by and see if we can learn a thing or two.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_14,"I checked the reviews, and apparently, it has a 5-star rating."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_15,"Seriously, does that even make sense?!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_16,People's preferences for even a single cup of coffee can vary greatly; whether they want sugar or milk added.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_17,Those reviews have to be fake.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_18,…
d_ex_maidcafe_08_19,"Allow me to properly introduce myself, ladies."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_20,"I'm Ade, the maid who has the pleasure of serving you today."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_21,"Wow, fancy."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_22,Wipe that smile off your face.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_23,"Now,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_24,what's a person got to do to get a menu around here?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_25,We don't have that either.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_26,"Shut it, you!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_27,"My sincere apologies for the delay in presenting the menus,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_28,as I was taking a moment to introduce myself.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_29,Well… at least you addressed the issue quickly enough.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_30,Let's see…
d_ex_maidcafe_08_31,What's good here? Is there anything you would recommend?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_32,Our most popular dish is undoubtedly the omurice.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_33,Our maids will personally drizzle ketchup atop the dish.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_34,No kidding?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_35,"All right, I'll take the omurice and a cup of coffee."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_36,I'll have the same.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_37,Certainly.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_38,Could you please wait just a moment?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_39,"If anything seems even slightly off about this place, I'm gonna leave a bad review."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_40,"Anyway,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_41,"it seems like you come here quite often, huh, Pal?"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_42,I come occasionally.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_43,"So, you're a fan as well?"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_44,I'm actually starting to really look forward to this.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_45,A short while later.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_46,Thank you for waiting.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_47,Here are your omurice and coffee.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_48,*Clang*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_49,Hmm?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_50,"Hey, Ade!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_51,Why are our coffees different color?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_52,We took great care in tailoring each cup to suit your preferences.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_53,"For Miss Sugar, we've sweetened the coffee with a touch more sugar,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_54,while yours is made creamier with the additional milk.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_55,"So, you cater to each customer's preferences? Seems like a hassle."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_56,It's no trouble at all.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_57,"Even with the same menu, I strive to create a uniquely delightful experience for both of you."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_58,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_59,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_60,Ha! You expect me to believe this is tasty?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_61,"Well, let me have a try!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_62,*Sip*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_63,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_08_64,What the heck is this? This rich milk taste...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_65,It's surprisingly delicious!
d_ex_maidcafe_08_66,I'd say 14 spoonfuls of sugar were used in mine.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_67,"That's sufficiently sweet. Quite pleasant, in fact."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_68,I'm delighted to hear that you both enjoyed it.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_69,"Hold your horses, we've not tried the omurice yet!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_70,"Who knows, it might taste horrendous!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_71,Would you like to have your omurice straight away?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_72,"If so, please allow me to garnish it with some ketchup."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_73,"For Miss Sugar, I believe a motorcycle would be most fitting."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_74,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_75,"For Miss Milk, I'll draw a mighty fist."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_76,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_77,"Voila, it's all done!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_78,"Wow, you're really good at that!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_79,It's so well-done that I'm almost tempted to give it a fist bump.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_80,"It's Black Typhoon, but… red."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_81,Very cool!
d_ex_maidcafe_08_82,Are we all set to dig in?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_83,Then...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_84,"Just a moment, ladies."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_85,Huh?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_86,You have to recite the spell with me.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_87,Come again?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_88,"Alakazam, make this sucker delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_89,"Hehe, that's a fine spell as well,"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_90,but there is one specific spell that is exclusive to the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_91,"Now, repeat after me."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_92,"Ooey gooey goodness, make this omurice delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_93,What in the world…?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_94,"Ooey gooey goodness, make this omurice delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_95,How can you just follow like that?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_96,Ugh…
d_ex_maidcafe_08_97,Do I really have to do this?
d_ex_maidcafe_08_98,"It's not mandatory, but reciting the spell would undoubtedly elevate the flavors."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_99,"Ugh, fine!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_100,"... Ooey gooey goodness, make this omurice delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_101,Incredible!
d_ex_maidcafe_08_102,You both recited the spell very nicely.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_103,"Now, please enjoy your meal."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_104,"Just you wait! If this tastes horrendous, I'm gonna give you the worst review ever!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_105,*Munch*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_106,*Munch*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_107,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_108,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_109,Thank you for dining with us.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_110,Hope to see you again soon.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_111,"Sure, everything we had today was decent, but don't celebrate just yet!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_112,"I'll be trying every dish on your menu, and if I find a flaw, you'll be in for a scathing review!"
d_ex_maidcafe_08_113,"Next time I come, I'll swap out the engine on Black Typhoon, and you can reflect that change in the ketchup doodle."
d_ex_maidcafe_08_114,*Jingle*
d_ex_maidcafe_08_115,...
d_ex_maidcafe_08_116,Ade gazes out the door with a soft smile.
d_ex_maidcafe_08_117,"Just like that, there are two more regulars at the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_modernbar_07_title,Cocktail Practice
d_ex_modernbar_07_1,"Today really took a toll on me,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_2,so I really want a drink right now.
d_ex_modernbar_07_3,*Jingle*
d_ex_modernbar_07_4,Hmm?
d_ex_modernbar_07_5,A-a customer?
d_ex_modernbar_07_6,"... Oh, it's you!"
d_ex_modernbar_07_7,"Welcome, Master."
d_ex_modernbar_07_8,"Please, sit wherever you like."
d_ex_modernbar_07_9,Are you two bartending tonight?
d_ex_modernbar_07_10,"Indeed, you are correct."
d_ex_modernbar_07_11,"Um… just Ade, really. I'm not really qualified to be called a bartender just yet."
d_ex_modernbar_07_12,"I'm supposed to bartend for the next show, but I don't know the first thing about making drinks,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_13,so I was having Ade show me the ropes...
d_ex_modernbar_07_14,"I didn't know you were good at making cocktails, Ade."
d_ex_modernbar_07_15,"Regrettably, I don't know all that many."
d_ex_modernbar_07_16,"I have acquired only some fundamentals, for the customers who enjoy the hard stuff."
d_ex_modernbar_07_17,"Given Noir's employment at Coin Rush,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_18,"she's already familiar with the alcohol types and brands, so I think she'll catch on quickly."
d_ex_modernbar_07_19,"Cocktails rely heavily on the precise ingredient ratios, so you can attain a marvelous taste by simply memorizing the recipe."
d_ex_modernbar_07_20,"In fact,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_21,"Master has arrived just in time. Would it not be fitting to make him a drink, Noir?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_22,Wh-what?!
d_ex_modernbar_07_23,That sounds nice.
d_ex_modernbar_07_24,B-but...
d_ex_modernbar_07_25,"You've devoted yourself wholeheartedly to learning today, so I am confident in you."
d_ex_modernbar_07_26,"Oh, boy…"
d_ex_modernbar_07_27,"I-is it really okay if I make it, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_28,Of course.
d_ex_modernbar_07_29,Okay…
d_ex_modernbar_07_30,I-I'll try and put what Ade taught me to good use.
d_ex_modernbar_07_31,Is there anything from the menu that you'd like?
d_ex_modernbar_07_32,Whatever you're most confident in making.
d_ex_modernbar_07_33,Whatever you find most challenging.
d_ex_modernbar_07_34,Hmm...
d_ex_modernbar_07_35,Let me think…
d_ex_modernbar_07_36,How about...
d_ex_modernbar_07_37,A Rainbow Peach?
d_ex_modernbar_07_38,"You created the cocktail effortlessly before, particularly given its short list of ingredients and straightforward ratios."
d_ex_modernbar_07_39,Okay!
d_ex_modernbar_07_40,I'll give it a try!
d_ex_modernbar_07_41,*Clank clank*
d_ex_modernbar_07_42,The highly strung Noir starts to mix the drink with a look of intense focus.
d_ex_modernbar_07_43,"After a while,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_44,she creates a sweet-looking pinkish cocktail.
d_ex_modernbar_07_45,All done!
d_ex_modernbar_07_46,Hmm...
d_ex_modernbar_07_47,Let me think…
d_ex_modernbar_07_48,How about...
d_ex_modernbar_07_49,An Aqua Shot?
d_ex_modernbar_07_50,You found that challenging earlier.
d_ex_modernbar_07_51,R-right…
d_ex_modernbar_07_52,…
d_ex_modernbar_07_53,"Okay, maybe I can use this as a chance to overcome it."
d_ex_modernbar_07_54,*Clank clank*
d_ex_modernbar_07_55,The highly strung Noir starts to mix the drink with a look of intense focus.
d_ex_modernbar_07_56,"After a while,"
d_ex_modernbar_07_57,she creates a shot with many layers.
d_ex_modernbar_07_58,"This one has a lot of ingredients, and it's difficult to layer them perfectly, so I screwed up a couple of times before…"
d_ex_modernbar_07_59,I hope you enjoy it.
d_ex_modernbar_07_60,Noir and Ade both look at me with differing amounts of nervousness.
d_ex_modernbar_07_61,I cautiously take a sip of the cocktail.
d_ex_modernbar_07_62,*Sip*
d_ex_modernbar_07_63,... It's delicious!
d_ex_modernbar_07_64,R-really?!
d_ex_modernbar_07_65,It has a harmonious blend of alcohol and fruity notes.
d_ex_modernbar_07_66,"It really is absolutely perfect, and I'm one happy camper."
d_ex_modernbar_07_67,"Well done, Noir."
d_ex_modernbar_07_68,"Would you like to have a sip, Ade?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_69,"Oh, may I?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_70,"In that case, I shall have a sip."
d_ex_modernbar_07_71,Ade accepts the glass from my hand and sips a small mouthful.
d_ex_modernbar_07_72,*Sip*
d_ex_modernbar_07_73,"Ah, truly invigorating!"
d_ex_modernbar_07_74,"You should give it a try too, Noir."
d_ex_modernbar_07_75,Er…
d_ex_modernbar_07_76,Wouldn't you be intrigued to know what your creation tastes like?
d_ex_modernbar_07_77,"I-I am, but…"
d_ex_modernbar_07_78,Okay... I'll have a sip...
d_ex_modernbar_07_79,*Sip*
d_ex_modernbar_07_80,Wow!
d_ex_modernbar_07_81,It's really delicious.
d_ex_modernbar_07_82,"This is all thanks to you, Ade."
d_ex_modernbar_07_83,Thank you!
d_ex_modernbar_07_84,"Please, we wouldn't have gotten anywhere if it weren't for your hard work."
d_ex_modernbar_07_85,"In any case, let us call it a day."
d_ex_modernbar_07_86,"Would you care for another drink, Master?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_87,"Sure, I'd hate to come and only have one."
d_ex_modernbar_07_88,"Very well then, may I have the pleasure of preparing one for you this time?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_89,"Yes, please!"
d_ex_modernbar_07_90,*Swish*
d_ex_modernbar_07_91,*Shake shake*
d_ex_modernbar_07_92,*Pour*
d_ex_modernbar_07_93,Here is your drink.
d_ex_modernbar_07_94,Ade skillfully makes a cocktail and pushes it in front of me.
d_ex_modernbar_07_95,*Sip*
d_ex_modernbar_07_96,...!
d_ex_modernbar_07_97,"To my surprise, the flavor is remarkably distinct and smooth."
d_ex_modernbar_07_98,"Judging by your widened eyes, I'm relieved to see that my choice resonates with your discerning taste."
d_ex_modernbar_07_99,"Whoa, is it good?"
d_ex_modernbar_07_100,Can I… Can I haf a sippp?
d_ex_modernbar_07_101,"Hmm? Noir, you're slurring your sentences…"
d_ex_modernbar_07_102,Huh? Meee?
d_ex_modernbar_07_103,"Oh, boy… everything's spinning…"
d_ex_modernbar_07_104,Noir begins to stagger before toppling toward Ade.
d_ex_modernbar_07_105,Oh my!
d_ex_modernbar_07_106,*Crash*
d_ex_modernbar_07_107,Ade! Noir!
d_ex_modernbar_07_108,"Fear not, I have caught her."
d_ex_modernbar_07_109,It appears that she is quite a lightweight.
d_ex_modernbar_07_110,It was no wonder she refrained from tasting any of the drinks she made.
d_ex_modernbar_07_111,I should have been more observant... It's the kind of lapse a maid should never allow.
d_ex_modernbar_07_112,Ugh… I-I'm sorryyy….
d_ex_modernbar_07_113,I'll take her back to her room.
d_ex_modernbar_07_114,"No, Master."
d_ex_modernbar_07_115,"This is entirely my oversight. Please, let me take care of this."
d_ex_modernbar_07_116,All right.
d_ex_modernbar_07_117,Very well.
d_ex_modernbar_07_118,"Noir will be acting as the bartender next week, so do take a moment to come at your convenience."
d_ex_modernbar_07_119,"As you can see, she has diligently devoted her efforts to it."
d_ex_modernbar_07_120,"As she speaks, Ade stares at Noir with a caring expression."
d_ex_modernbar_07_121,"As I leave the Trendy Bar, I check next week's schedule."
d_ex_modernbar_07_122,I must admit… I could have used another drink or two.
d_ex_workshop_08_title,BOOM Friend
d_ex_workshop_08_1,Nice!
d_ex_workshop_08_2,"You really are great at making stuff, Liter. You live up to your reputation."
d_ex_workshop_08_3,"And so detailed, too! This is gonna be a lifesaver."
d_ex_workshop_08_4,Everyone is always happy
d_ex_workshop_08_5,with Liter's work!
d_ex_workshop_08_6,Naturally.
d_ex_workshop_08_7,"Honestly, getting showered with nonstop compliments is starting to get old."
d_ex_workshop_08_8,"If you don't need anything else, then move along."
d_ex_workshop_08_9,Whatever you say!
d_ex_workshop_08_10,"Now that we've got the part we need, let's head back, Mr. Commander."
d_ex_workshop_08_11,It's unusual for you to go back so quietly.
d_ex_workshop_08_12,What do you mean?
d_ex_workshop_08_13,Normally you'd make a big commotion about installing BOOM somewh...
d_ex_workshop_08_14,"Um... Liter, this display seems to be acting up."
d_ex_workshop_08_15,All these weird monsters are swarming on screen...
d_ex_workshop_08_16,Here too! And here!
d_ex_workshop_08_17,It's happening to all the screens in the Workshop!
d_ex_workshop_08_18,What?
d_ex_workshop_08_19,...
d_ex_workshop_08_20,What do you take me for? Of course I installed it everywhere.
d_ex_workshop_08_21,I want the entire world to be able to play BOOM.
d_ex_workshop_08_22,"Centi might be fine with that, but I doubt Liter will appreciate it."
d_ex_workshop_08_23,Liter?
d_ex_workshop_08_24,Both of us nervously turn our heads and look towards Liter.
d_ex_workshop_08_25,Is that...?
d_ex_workshop_08_26,She doesn't look too good.
d_ex_workshop_08_27,You think she's mad at me?
d_ex_workshop_08_28,Most likely.
d_ex_workshop_08_29,Uh oh. Abort installation! Abort!
d_ex_workshop_08_30,Isn't this BOOM?
d_ex_workshop_08_31,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_08_32,You know what this is?
d_ex_workshop_08_33,Of course I do.
d_ex_workshop_08_34,It's BOOM. A classic FPS.
d_ex_workshop_08_35,"I used to play it back in the day, but only casually."
d_ex_workshop_08_36,"Even by the standards back then, it was pretty archaic. Not something you would want to play for too long."
d_ex_workshop_08_37,I wonder if I should pick it back up again...
d_ex_workshop_08_38,...
d_ex_workshop_08_39,No way!
d_ex_workshop_08_40,You know about BOOM?
d_ex_workshop_08_41,And you've actually tried it a long time ago?!
d_ex_workshop_08_42,When did you first play it?
d_ex_workshop_08_43,What's your favorite BOOM Guy line?
d_ex_workshop_08_44,Gah! Don't sneak up on me like that.
d_ex_workshop_08_45,And stop screaming in my ear.
d_ex_workshop_08_46,Sorry! I got a little excited...
d_ex_workshop_08_47,S-so...
d_ex_workshop_08_48,When did you first play BOOM?
d_ex_workshop_08_49,I don't quite remember.
d_ex_workshop_08_50,"Video games are usually tough and make me dizzy, so I wasn't a huge fan."
d_ex_workshop_08_51,"However, I do remember the controls of BOOM being nice and smooth. Very simple as well, perhaps because it was made so long ago."
d_ex_workshop_08_52,"Like I said, I only dabbled in it a few times."
d_ex_workshop_08_53,It's nice seeing it again after all this time.
d_ex_workshop_08_54,Wow...
d_ex_workshop_08_55,This is amazing. Just amazing.
d_ex_workshop_08_56,I don't see what you're so excited about.
d_ex_workshop_08_57,"Anyway, I assume you're the one behind this?"
d_ex_workshop_08_58,Hmm...
d_ex_workshop_08_59,Having it installed on every device is overkill. Just leave it installed on my personal tablet.
d_ex_workshop_08_60,Maybe I can relive some old memories next time I get bored.
d_ex_workshop_08_61,Wow! Really?!
d_ex_workshop_08_62,I'll add a couple of new modes for you. You're gonna love 'em!
d_ex_workshop_08_63,Do as you please.
d_ex_workshop_08_64,Wow.
d_ex_workshop_08_65,This is the first time I've seen Liter interested in something like this.
d_ex_workshop_08_66,I know. I'm a little taken aback myself.
d_ex_workshop_08_67,"It's been a while since she had any real fun, so it'll be nice for her to blow off some steam."
d_ex_workshop_08_68,"Elegg doesn't seem to have any intention of going back for a while,"
d_ex_workshop_08_69,so I decide to leave the Workshop by myself.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_title,Elegg's Mountain
d_ex_clothingstore_09_1,*Ring*
d_ex_clothingstore_09_2,Welcome.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_3,"Oh, you are..."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_4,"Hey there,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_5,Ludmilla!
d_ex_clothingstore_09_6,The Commander said I'd have an opportunity to meet you if I came here.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_7,I'm quite flattered that you'd make a trip expressly to see me.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_8,Do you know each other?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_9,Of course.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_10,"Ludmilla, in a word..."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_11,Is a mountain to overcome.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_12,Come again?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_13,"Haha, such grandiose praise."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_14,"Then again, considering how all machines go haywire once I touch them, I can see how that would impress you."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_15,"I've been trying to wrap my head around it for ages, and all I can come up with is that it must be an electrical issue."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_16,Could you try holding this for me?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_17,All right.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_18,Elegg hands Ludmilla a square-shaped device.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_19,What is it?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_20,A mobile phone that only requires very small amounts of energy to operate.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_21,It's a recent invention. Very innovative.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_22,Hmm...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_23,"Well, it doesn't seem to have broken down yet."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_24,I don't sense any electrical surges either.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_25,Ooh! Is that right?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_26,Did I finally find something Ludmilla-proof?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_27,However...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_28,the screen isn't turning on.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_29,Huh? That can't be...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_30,Elegg takes the phone from Ludmilla and fiddles with it.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_31,Holy crap.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_32,It's completely shot.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_33,There isn't a bit of juice left in it. It went kaput without a sound...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_34,"Hehe, seems like you haven't surmounted this body of mine just yet."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_35,"On another note, I wanted to thank you."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_36,"Thanks to that voice recognition device you installed,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_37,I'm able to communicate with others relatively smoothly.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_38,"At first, I just wanted to help you,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_39,but now it's become a point of pride!
d_ex_clothingstore_09_40,"I don't care how incompatible you are with electronics,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_41,I will find a solution if it's the last thing I do!
d_ex_clothingstore_09_42,You can count on that.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_43,"Elegg extends her hand to Ludmilla,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_44,who grins and shakes it.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_45,"Hehe, I hope you succeed."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_46,Whoa...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_47,Hmm?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_48,...?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_49,What the...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_50,Wh-what just happened?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_51,"The instant you touched my hand,"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_52,I felt all the energy drain from my body. It felt amazing.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_53,"If you don't mind, could we do it again?"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_54,Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_55,Let's see...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_56,Let's start by gently caressing the fingertips...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_57,"Oh yeah, that's the stuff..."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_58,Why is this happening?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_59,I have no idea.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_60,Whenever I hold your hand... how should I put it...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_61,it feels like my whole body loosens.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_62,"Wait, that's it!"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_63,Maybe...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_64,Did you figure something out?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_65,Is this what machines feel when you touch them...?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_66,"If that's the case, it would make sense why they break down."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_67,What?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_68,This is uncharted territory.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_69,"A brand new feeling, wholly distinct from how you feel when electricity is coursing through you."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_70,I have to look into this.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_71,See you two next time.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_72,*Ring*
d_ex_clothingstore_09_73,...
d_ex_clothingstore_09_74,"Servant, is that what you feel when you touch me?"
d_ex_clothingstore_09_75,Not at all.
d_ex_clothingstore_09_76,Really...?
d_ex_clothingstore_09_77,"Hmm, I really can't figure it out."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_78,"Both of us stand there, lost in thought as we ruminate on the growing number of questions."
d_ex_clothingstore_09_79,It seems that we can only wait for the results of Elegg's next research.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_title,Silent Club
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_1,*Ring*
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_2,Is this the place
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_3,you mentioned?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_4,It is.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_5,*Inhale*
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_6,Pheeeww...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_7,"Now that I've installed BOOM just about everywhere in the Outpost,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_8,and we're finally here! The last location where I haven't installed it.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_9,Even the air here feels different.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_10,I won't let a single screen out of my grasp.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_11,*Creak*
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_12,But it doesn't seem like anyone is taking care of this place.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_13,I doubt there's anyone here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_14,"Yeah, seems abandoned."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_15,Hmm...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_16,Your expression tells me you have a lot of stories to tell about this place.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_17,"I won't press, though."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_18,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_19,Oh!
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_20,Looks like this place has a basement.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_21,Let's check it out.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_22,"Wait, that's..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_23,"Dang, it's pitch black in here."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_24,*Shake*
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_25,I swear I hear something inside.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_26,I wonder what's hidden here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_27,"Oh, here's something."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_28,*Crack*
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_29,Huh...?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_30,Gah!
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_31,Wh-who is it?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_32,Soda?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_33,Master?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_34,Elegg?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_35,Phew... what a relief.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_36,"I was told that there was no one here, so when I started hearing voices, I was startled."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_37,"We were told the same thing, so imagine our surprise to find you here."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_38,We came to install BOOM.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_39,BOOM?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_40,Interesting.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_41,What are you doing here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_42,Someone sent me here to clean up this place.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_43,Who?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_44,"It was an anonymous request that came to the Maid Cafe, so I don't really know."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_45,I see.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_46,There are all sorts of strange things down here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_47,"Whips, latex, restraints..."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_48,Looks to me like someone was tortured in here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_49,T-tortured?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_50,Yes.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_51,"That, or someone had some rather unique preferences."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_52,This entire place has a fascinating layout.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_53,"The first floor is a standard pub,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_54,"while the basement feels like a storage space of some kind, like a warehouse."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_55,In fact...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_56,This would be perfect for turning into an arcade!
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_57,An arcade?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_58,Yeah.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_59,"We can place all the arcade cabinets down here in the basement,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_60,and offer delicious refreshments up on the first floor.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_61,"What do you think, Mr. Commander?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_62,Elegg fixes me with a puppy dog look of such intensity that I feel slightly uncomfortable.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_63,No.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_64,"Aw, c'mon!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_65,Don't you think you're being a just bit too harsh?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_66,Fine.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_67,I guess I'll just have to do it myself.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_68,"That's fine, but you still can't do it here."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_69,"Ugh, fine."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_70,First order of business: Find a suitable place for an arcade.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_71,Uh...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_72,Is it okay if we just leave all the stuff here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_73,"They're pretty large, and would be difficult to dispose of. Plus everything's already neatly stored away."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_74,"Considering how much of a mess the rest of this place is,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_75,the fact that these items are relatively clean tells me someone must get a lot out of them.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_76,"It doesn't seem like they need all that much rearranging, so I suppose we can just leave them as is."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_77,I guess so...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_78,"Well shoot, I guess that means I'm done cleaning!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_79,I'm nearly done installing BOOM as well.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_80,"There are still some unused screens hiding here and there, so it may take me a minute."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_81,Give me a second.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_82,Sure.
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_83,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_84,"Once Elegg finishes installing BOOM, we leave the club."
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_85,"I'm not sure when I will be back,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_06_86,but I think it will be a good idea to leave these items alone for the time being.
d_ex_observationpost_07_title,Sound Showdown
d_ex_observationpost_07_1,...
d_ex_observationpost_07_2,...
d_ex_observationpost_07_3,"Exia wears Signal's headset, seemingly lost in thought."
d_ex_observationpost_07_4,Well...
d_ex_observationpost_07_5,Exia?
d_ex_observationpost_07_6,Hmm...
d_ex_observationpost_07_7,Um...
d_ex_observationpost_07_8,You look kinda serious. What are you listening to?
d_ex_observationpost_07_9,Is there something wrong with my headset?
d_ex_observationpost_07_10,Sssh.
d_ex_observationpost_07_11,"Silence, if you will. I'm not ready to give a review yet."
d_ex_observationpost_07_12,"Oh, okay..."
d_ex_observationpost_07_13,Signal hastily puts her hand over her mouth.
d_ex_observationpost_07_14,What are you two up to?
d_ex_observationpost_07_15,"Hey, Commander!"
d_ex_observationpost_07_16,"Noob,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_17,you won't believe what I just found out.
d_ex_observationpost_07_18,What is it?
d_ex_observationpost_07_19,I've realized...
d_ex_observationpost_07_20,Elysion's equipment is way better than Missilis'.
d_ex_observationpost_07_21,What do you mean?
d_ex_observationpost_07_22,"Ever since she got her hands on my headset,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_23,she can't stop going on about how great our gear is.
d_ex_observationpost_07_24,"And more specifically, your military equipment."
d_ex_observationpost_07_25,Yeah.
d_ex_observationpost_07_26,I honestly never gave it that much thought until now.
d_ex_observationpost_07_27,"But one time,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_28,Novel came over and also said that Elysion's headsets were the best.
d_ex_observationpost_07_29,"Because when Signal and I were both wearing headsets, she could hear more clearly."
d_ex_observationpost_07_30,I dismissed it at the time because it was coming from someone who couldn't tell a headset from a hole in the ground.
d_ex_observationpost_07_31,Who is clueless about cell phones and runs around with paper and pen all day.
d_ex_observationpost_07_32,... Aren't you and Novel from the same squad?
d_ex_observationpost_07_33,I was going to say the same thing...
d_ex_observationpost_07_34,"However,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_35,"although I hate to admit it,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_36,she was totally right.
d_ex_observationpost_07_37,"I tried Signal's headset,"
d_ex_observationpost_07_38,and it's a thousand times better than
d_ex_observationpost_07_39,the MISY-0756WS I bought last week.
d_ex_observationpost_07_40,Is there really that much of a difference?
d_ex_observationpost_07_41,There absolutely is.
d_ex_observationpost_07_42,Do you want to have a listen?
d_ex_observationpost_07_43,"This is the MISY-0756WS, which only launched last week."
d_ex_observationpost_07_44,Exia places her new headset on my ears.
d_ex_observationpost_07_45,"There's a beeping sound, and music begins to play."
d_ex_observationpost_07_46,...!
d_ex_observationpost_07_47,Missilis' latest headset is quite remarkable. The sound quality is exquisite.
d_ex_observationpost_07_48,"All right, now Signal's."
d_ex_observationpost_07_49,Exia puts Signal's headset on me.
d_ex_observationpost_07_50,"There is a beep, just like before, and once again music starts to play."
d_ex_observationpost_07_51,?!!
d_ex_observationpost_07_52,What do you think?
d_ex_observationpost_07_53,I don't sense much of a difference.
d_ex_observationpost_07_54,"It's subtle, but Signal's headset is indeed slightly superior."
d_ex_observationpost_07_55,You don't think there's a difference?
d_ex_observationpost_07_56,Such a typical answer from you.
d_ex_observationpost_07_57,...
d_ex_observationpost_07_58,I knew you'd notice the nuances!
d_ex_observationpost_07_59,"From now on, I'll call you Noob the Audiophile!"
d_ex_observationpost_07_60,... Let's just stick with Noob.
d_ex_observationpost_07_61,"Anyway, Elysion's military equipment is the best."
d_ex_observationpost_07_62,"Missilis can stick to missiles. Tetra, however, should quit the audio business altogether."
d_ex_observationpost_07_63,"Um... thanks, I guess."
d_ex_observationpost_07_64,No. I won't let this stand.
d_ex_observationpost_07_65,I won't let Novel have the last word here.
d_ex_observationpost_07_66,Although I must say it's a joy to experience such quality.
d_ex_observationpost_07_67,It's enough to warm the cockles of my heart.
d_ex_observationpost_07_68,Well... I'm glad you enjoyed it.
d_ex_observationpost_07_69,The showdown will have to wait for later.
d_ex_observationpost_07_70,Exia leaves.
d_ex_observationpost_07_71,What did she mean by that?
d_ex_observationpost_07_72,I was wondering the same thing.
d_ex_observationpost_07_73,A few days later.
d_ex_observationpost_07_74,"All right, Signal!"
d_ex_observationpost_07_75,It's time for the final showdown!
d_ex_observationpost_07_76,Huh?
d_ex_observationpost_07_77,Final showdown?
d_ex_observationpost_07_78,That's right!
d_ex_observationpost_07_79,I won't lose again.
d_ex_observationpost_07_80,I've armed myself with the finest Elysion products:
d_ex_observationpost_07_81,"headset, hoodie, and bag."
d_ex_observationpost_07_82,I've turned my back on Tetra and gone to the dark side.
d_ex_observationpost_07_83,My heart now belongs to Elysion.
d_ex_observationpost_07_84,So that's all Elysion gear?
d_ex_observationpost_07_85,Pretty cool... Are those game symbols? All these products are new to me.
d_ex_observationpost_07_86,That's because it's a personalized outfit. The standard issue one doesn't look so great.
d_ex_observationpost_07_87,"Oh, so you customized this outfit yourself?"
d_ex_observationpost_07_88,Nice work.
d_ex_observationpost_07_89,"It took a lot of effort, I'll tell you that much."
d_ex_observationpost_07_90,Exia holds up the bag with Elysion's logo.
d_ex_observationpost_07_91,"Come on, let's fight."
d_ex_observationpost_07_92,We'll see
d_ex_observationpost_07_93,whose sound quality is superior this time.
d_ex_observationpost_07_94,Uh...
d_ex_observationpost_07_95,we can just declare you the winner.
d_ex_observationpost_07_96,No!
d_ex_observationpost_07_97,I've got to win fair and square.
d_ex_observationpost_07_98,I think I'll be going...
d_ex_observationpost_07_99,"Where do you think you're going, Noob?"
d_ex_observationpost_07_100,You're going to be the referee!
d_ex_observationpost_07_101,You can't leave!
d_ex_observationpost_07_102,...
d_ex_observationpost_07_103,*Sigh*
d_ex_observationpost_07_104,"Signal and I are then forced to try on numerous headsets and in-ear monitors until Exia's self-proclaimed ""showdown"" is over."
d_ex_hotel_08_title,Hotel Night Shift Code
d_ex_hotel_08_1,I receive a letter from an unknown sender.
d_ex_hotel_08_2,"""Need help. Come to the Hotel alone tonight."""
d_ex_hotel_08_3,"So, I arrive at the Hotel right after the sun sets..."
d_ex_hotel_08_4,...
d_ex_hotel_08_5,It's too quiet in the lobby.
d_ex_hotel_08_6,I suddenly notice there's a key card in the envelope.
d_ex_hotel_08_7,"Well, since I brought it with me..."
d_ex_hotel_08_8,The number 307 is written on the card.
d_ex_hotel_08_9,Let me go to Room 307 then.
d_ex_hotel_08_10,*Beep*
d_ex_hotel_08_11,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_08_12,... You're here.
d_ex_hotel_08_13,D? Did you send me the letter?
d_ex_hotel_08_14,"Yeah, I have a favor to ask you."
d_ex_hotel_08_15,...?
d_ex_hotel_08_16,K said that...
d_ex_hotel_08_17,there's an odd tale circulating around the Outpost lately.
d_ex_hotel_08_18,I'm talking about
d_ex_hotel_08_19,the Hotel Night Shift Code.
d_ex_hotel_08_20,Hotel Night Shift... Code?
d_ex_hotel_08_21,That sounds pretty normal.
d_ex_hotel_08_22,... Not if you know what it's actually about.
d_ex_hotel_08_23,"Anyway, if a tale like this spreads around,"
d_ex_hotel_08_24,the hotel guests will feel anxious.
d_ex_hotel_08_25,"So, I'm gonna figure out what's really going on."
d_ex_hotel_08_26,I want this Hotel to remain as a safe zone.
d_ex_hotel_08_27,"So, I'll just help you investigate, right?"
d_ex_hotel_08_28,That's the point.
d_ex_hotel_08_29,But why are you dressed like that?
d_ex_hotel_08_30,"I can't reveal my true identity,"
d_ex_hotel_08_31,so I can only disguise myself.
d_ex_hotel_08_32,Any more questions?
d_ex_hotel_08_33,I want to start the investigation right now.
d_ex_hotel_08_34,Got it. Where do we start?
d_ex_hotel_08_35,Just wait here.
d_ex_hotel_08_36,"Rule No. 1 is about this place,"
d_ex_hotel_08_37,Room 307.
d_ex_hotel_08_38,... Can you elaborate?
d_ex_hotel_08_39,"During the night patrol, if the door to Room 307 is found open, it is imperative that you promptly secure it."
d_ex_hotel_08_40,Do not look inside the room.
d_ex_hotel_08_41,Lock it by pressing the lock button on the door's inside handle.
d_ex_hotel_08_42,"※ Room 307 is an abandoned room, so there are no key cards to this room."
d_ex_hotel_08_43,No guests shall be accommodated in this room.
d_ex_hotel_08_44,... That's rule No. 1.
d_ex_hotel_08_45,...
d_ex_hotel_08_46,We'll just sit here and wait for the door to open on its own.
d_ex_hotel_08_47,"Then, we can uncover the truth."
d_ex_hotel_08_48,"Before that, I have a question."
d_ex_hotel_08_49,Yes?
d_ex_hotel_08_50,I pass the key card to D.
d_ex_hotel_08_51,This is the key card I sent you. Is there any problem?
d_ex_hotel_08_52,Didn't you say this room has no key cards?
d_ex_hotel_08_53,...
d_ex_hotel_08_54,"As D takes the key card from me, she appears to be sorting out her thoughts."
d_ex_hotel_08_55,What is the next rule?
d_ex_hotel_08_56,The next rule is:
d_ex_hotel_08_57,"During the night patrol, if you come across a pale-skinned woman with black hair,"
d_ex_hotel_08_58,do not look into her eyes and continue the patrol.
d_ex_hotel_08_59,※ Whoever looks into her eyes or turns to leave the area
d_ex_hotel_08_60,will encounter her again.
d_ex_hotel_08_61,... That's rule No. 2.
d_ex_hotel_08_62,A pale-skinned woman... with black hair...?
d_ex_hotel_08_63,Yes.
d_ex_hotel_08_64,The pale-skinned woman with black hair before me gives a little nod.
d_ex_hotel_08_65,"What if someone finds out your real identity, D?"
d_ex_hotel_08_66,"Well, tail them for more info?"
d_ex_hotel_08_67,... Right. You'd do that.
d_ex_hotel_08_68,...
d_ex_hotel_08_69,Why don't we patrol the corridor
d_ex_hotel_08_70,to find out more about rule No.2?
d_ex_hotel_08_71,Er...  why bother?
d_ex_hotel_08_72,What do you mean?
d_ex_hotel_08_73,...
d_ex_hotel_08_74,... Ah.
d_ex_hotel_08_75,What's the next rule anyway?
d_ex_hotel_08_76,D tells me some more rules in the Code.
d_ex_hotel_08_77,"As I listen to the rules, one thing starts making more sense."
d_ex_hotel_08_78,"Now, here's the final one."
d_ex_hotel_08_79,If a woman wearing a hood that covers her face asks your name or contact information...
d_ex_hotel_08_80,This Code was made by someone who knows D.
d_ex_hotel_08_81,That's what it says...
d_ex_hotel_08_82,You look like you're onto something.
d_ex_hotel_08_83,Yeah...
d_ex_hotel_08_84,"Who told you about this tale, D?"
d_ex_hotel_08_85,K...
d_ex_hotel_08_86,... Have you perhaps...
d_ex_hotel_08_87,heard about it before?
d_ex_hotel_08_88,Not until today.
d_ex_hotel_08_89,Did it start spreading from the Outpost?
d_ex_hotel_08_90,...
d_ex_hotel_08_91,... I don't think so.
d_ex_hotel_08_92,D seems to have had a realization of sorts.
d_ex_hotel_08_93,*Knock knock*
d_ex_hotel_08_94,??
d_ex_hotel_08_95,Did you call someone over?
d_ex_hotel_08_96,No way.
d_ex_hotel_08_97,The door suddenly opens itself.
d_ex_hotel_08_98,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_08_99,!!
d_ex_hotel_08_100,"There is no one outside,"
d_ex_hotel_08_101,but a note left along with a trolley.
d_ex_hotel_08_102,A note?
d_ex_hotel_08_103,"""Thanks for working hard on the missions."""
d_ex_hotel_08_104,"""Don't worry about the fee and just have a good rest today."""
d_ex_hotel_08_105,"""Hope you have a lovely evening."""
d_ex_hotel_08_106,...
d_ex_hotel_08_107,... Huh?
d_ex_hotel_08_108,How boring.
d_ex_hotel_08_109,...
d_ex_hotel_08_110,... It seems like the investigation into the odd tale has come to an end.
d_ex_observationpost_08_title,Viewing Party
d_ex_observationpost_08_1,I come to the Observatory to observe the surface.
d_ex_observationpost_08_2,"There, Signal is watching TV."
d_ex_observationpost_08_3,Hmm...
d_ex_observationpost_08_4,"... And there's also D, who's in disguise."
d_ex_observationpost_08_5,??
d_ex_observationpost_08_6,What are you doing here?
d_ex_observationpost_08_7,C-C-C-Commander?
d_ex_observationpost_08_8,"Oh, hello."
d_ex_observationpost_08_9,I'm watching a TV series with Signal...
d_ex_observationpost_08_10,"Signal, will there be anyone else joining us?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_11,"Ah, no. Commander must have come here..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_12,for work... r-right...?
d_ex_observationpost_08_13,"Yeah, I'm here to request for surface observation..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_14,What are the coordinates of the place you wish to observe?
d_ex_observationpost_08_15,I tell Signal the coordinates.
d_ex_observationpost_08_16,"Please wait here for a moment, Diana."
d_ex_observationpost_08_17,Diana...?
d_ex_observationpost_08_18,Signal leaves to inspect the observation screen.
d_ex_observationpost_08_19,"What's this about, D?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_20,What? Are you talking to me?
d_ex_observationpost_08_21,D whispers to me.
d_ex_observationpost_08_22,(Call me Diana in front of Signal.)
d_ex_observationpost_08_23,(Is this supposed to be some disguise?)
d_ex_observationpost_08_24,"(So, Signal is your next target...?)"
d_ex_observationpost_08_25,(What are you talking about?)
d_ex_observationpost_08_26,"(Then, tell me what you're doing here...)"
d_ex_observationpost_08_27,(You just heard me.)
d_ex_observationpost_08_28,(We're watching a TV series.)
d_ex_observationpost_08_29,??
d_ex_observationpost_08_30,(What's that look supposed to mean?)
d_ex_observationpost_08_31,...
d_ex_observationpost_08_32,"(OK, you may join us as well.)"
d_ex_observationpost_08_33,(That should answer your question.)
d_ex_observationpost_08_34,C-Commander...
d_ex_observationpost_08_35,"When Signal returns to her seat,"
d_ex_observationpost_08_36,D smiles gently as if nothing has happened.
d_ex_observationpost_08_37,"Ah, here's... the information you wanted..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_38,Thank you.
d_ex_observationpost_08_39,"Uh, uh..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_40,"Heh-heh. Signal, if you're done with work, shall we get back to our TV series?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_41,"By the way, this gentleman wants to join us. Is that all right?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_42,H-huh?!
d_ex_observationpost_08_43,"Yes, is it ok if I join you?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_44,S-sure... Please have a seat.
d_ex_observationpost_08_45,"After I sit down, Signal turns on the TV."
d_ex_observationpost_08_46,It's a romance comedy series.
d_ex_observationpost_08_47,After a while.
d_ex_observationpost_08_48,H-how do you like it?
d_ex_observationpost_08_49,It was interesting.
d_ex_observationpost_08_50,"And you, Diana?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_51,I liked it.
d_ex_observationpost_08_52,The main conflict in this series is
d_ex_observationpost_08_53,"the wife finding out she's been cheated on, right?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_54,I... guess...?
d_ex_observationpost_08_55,"But her reaction was a bit off,"
d_ex_observationpost_08_56,don't you think?
d_ex_observationpost_08_57,"If it were me, I'd slap the man first."
d_ex_observationpost_08_58,"That's true! She's been cheated on, after all..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_59,"She seems too calm, so I found it a little frustrating too..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_60,I think she should be like...
d_ex_observationpost_08_61,D and the Signal begin chatting.
d_ex_observationpost_08_62,I listen silently for quite a while.
d_ex_observationpost_08_63,Their conversation revolves around the actors' lines and acting.
d_ex_observationpost_08_64,"Whew, let's wrap up today's viewing party?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_65,"Sure, I had a great time."
d_ex_observationpost_08_66,"Wait, I almost forgot... Commander is here."
d_ex_observationpost_08_67,"S-sorry, we left you out..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_68,"It's ok. I had a great time, too."
d_ex_observationpost_08_69,You did? Brilliant!
d_ex_observationpost_08_70,"Shall we go, then?"
d_ex_observationpost_08_71,Signal sees us off at the Outpost.
d_ex_observationpost_08_72,"Now, you know why"
d_ex_observationpost_08_73,I wanted to have a viewing party with Signal?
d_ex_observationpost_08_74,I guess so.
d_ex_observationpost_08_75,...
d_ex_observationpost_08_76,Acting is a necessity for some missions.
d_ex_observationpost_08_77,That's why I often study the characters while watching TV series.
d_ex_observationpost_08_78,"I also thought of gathering others' opinions,"
d_ex_observationpost_08_79,so I have viewing parties with Signal regularly.
d_ex_observationpost_08_80,That's when we talk about the characters.
d_ex_observationpost_08_81,I see.
d_ex_observationpost_08_82,"Anyway, now you know..."
d_ex_observationpost_08_83,"So, please don't come to the next one."
d_ex_observationpost_08_84,H-huh?
d_ex_observationpost_08_85,...
d_ex_observationpost_08_86,Signal can't focus with you around.
d_ex_observationpost_08_87,??
d_ex_observationpost_08_88,"The viewing party ends smoothly, yet it leaves me with new questions swirling in my mind."
d_ex_theater_08_title,"Kitten, Theater, and Lion"
d_ex_theater_08_1,Leona asks me a favor this morning.
d_ex_theater_08_2,"Can you take Timi to the Theater today, Zoo Keeper?"
d_ex_theater_08_3,A movie starring Timi has been released.
d_ex_theater_08_4,But I can't take him there as I got something urgent to take care of.
d_ex_theater_08_5,Is that ok?
d_ex_theater_08_6,With that...
d_ex_theater_08_7,Graul!
d_ex_theater_08_8,I take Timi to the Theater.
d_ex_theater_08_9,"By the way, I haven't asked"
d_ex_theater_08_10,what character you played.
d_ex_theater_08_11,Graul?
d_ex_theater_08_12,I take out the poster I got when I entered the Theater.
d_ex_theater_08_13,Super Cat's Hunting Instincts II
d_ex_theater_08_14,There are many cats on the poster.
d_ex_theater_08_15,Well... it's not surprising that a lion blends in...?
d_ex_theater_08_16,Graul!
d_ex_theater_08_17,At that moment...
d_ex_theater_08_18,!!
d_ex_theater_08_19,I feel a cold gaze from somewhere.
d_ex_theater_08_20,You are...?!
d_ex_theater_08_21,... Huh?
d_ex_theater_08_22,Please keep quiet in the Theater.
d_ex_theater_08_23,D?! What are you doing here?
d_ex_theater_08_24,D silently takes out a poster.
d_ex_theater_08_25,"You're here to see the movie, too?"
d_ex_theater_08_26,Watching movies helps improve my acting skills.
d_ex_theater_08_27,"Besides, I should be the one who's surprised."
d_ex_theater_08_28,How so?
d_ex_theater_08_29,"For one, I didn't know you were a fan of this kind of movie."
d_ex_theater_08_30,"Well, I..."
d_ex_theater_08_31,Graul!
d_ex_theater_08_32,...!!
d_ex_theater_08_33,Behind you...
d_ex_theater_08_34,"Ah, you mean Timi?"
d_ex_theater_08_35,Timi joyfully purrs as I stroke his fur.
d_ex_theater_08_36,!!
d_ex_theater_08_37,If it's okay...
d_ex_theater_08_38,"Ah, the movie has started."
d_ex_theater_08_39,Let's talk after it ends.
d_ex_theater_08_40,... Sure.
d_ex_theater_08_41,And the movie begins.
d_ex_theater_08_42,...
d_ex_theater_08_43,Graul!
d_ex_theater_08_44,Timi roars fiercely on the screen.
d_ex_theater_08_45,"After the opening,"
d_ex_theater_08_46,the story of Super Cat's Hunting Instincts II begins.
d_ex_theater_08_47,"Oh... So, that's your part in the movie."
d_ex_theater_08_48,Graul!
d_ex_theater_08_49,...!!
d_ex_theater_08_50,I feel a heated gaze coming from beside me.
d_ex_theater_08_51,I have to stay quiet now.
d_ex_theater_08_52,The movie has come to an end.
d_ex_theater_08_53,It's a movie full of cats.
d_ex_theater_08_54,It was nice.
d_ex_theater_08_55,Graul...
d_ex_theater_08_56,... Yeah.
d_ex_theater_08_57,"Huh? By the way, D, didn't you just say that"
d_ex_theater_08_58,watching movies helps with acting?
d_ex_theater_08_59,But this one was all about cats...
d_ex_theater_08_60,...
d_ex_theater_08_61,... I like cats.
d_ex_theater_08_62,...
d_ex_theater_08_63,"Please keep it a secret from K. I didn't want to get caught, so I even disguised myself."
d_ex_theater_08_64,... Sure thing.
d_ex_theater_08_65,"Also, this was what I wanted to say before the movie started..."
d_ex_theater_08_66,??
d_ex_theater_08_67,"... If it's all right, can Timi leave a footprint on my poster?"
d_ex_theater_08_68,"With that, I uncover yet another secret about D."
d_ex_cafe_08_title,The Perfect Cookie
d_ex_cafe_08_1,I promised to make cookies with Bay and Emma today.
d_ex_cafe_08_2,"Bay is almost fanatical about being punctual, so I should hurry."
d_ex_cafe_08_3,*Jingle*
d_ex_cafe_08_4,"Welcome, Commander."
d_ex_cafe_08_5,"Hey, Coach."
d_ex_cafe_08_6,"As I step into the cafe, I'm met with a warm welcome from Emma and Bay, who've already taken care of all the culinary preparations."
d_ex_cafe_08_7,"Today, we are going to make some strawberry cookies!"
d_ex_cafe_08_8,"I'm using this special recipe Ade gave me, and she swears by them."
d_ex_cafe_08_9,"Hehe, you're gonna love them!"
d_ex_cafe_08_10,"Um... You sure this is okay? It's my first time cooking, you know."
d_ex_cafe_08_11,"Don't worry,"
d_ex_cafe_08_12,Commander and I will guide you along.
d_ex_cafe_08_13,I'll... er... do what I can.
d_ex_cafe_08_14,Great!
d_ex_cafe_08_15,"Let's get started, shall we?"
d_ex_cafe_08_16,"All right, this is gonna be fun!"
d_ex_cafe_08_17,Bay proceeds to start making her first cookie.
d_ex_cafe_08_18,"Let's see... First, I need 300 grams of strawberries."
d_ex_cafe_08_19,Here you go.
d_ex_cafe_08_20,"Ooh, the red strawberries look incredibly tempting, don't they? Tee-hee!"
d_ex_cafe_08_21,Definitely.
d_ex_cafe_08_22,"As long as I stick to the recipe, I'm bound to make a killer cookie."
d_ex_cafe_08_23,"Bay starts to prepare the strawberries,"
d_ex_cafe_08_24,and then places them one by one onto a scale.
d_ex_cafe_08_25,298g...
d_ex_cafe_08_26,300g!
d_ex_cafe_08_27,Perfect.
d_ex_cafe_08_28,You're doing pretty well.
d_ex_cafe_08_29,"I think so too! It's your first time, but you haven't made any mistakes yet."
d_ex_cafe_08_30,Impressive!
d_ex_cafe_08_31,That's only because I've got you two helping me.
d_ex_cafe_08_32,"Aww, you should see your face, Bay. You're nearly as red as the strawberries."
d_ex_cafe_08_33,... What should I do next?
d_ex_cafe_08_34,"Hehe, look at you, changing the subject."
d_ex_cafe_08_35,Stop teasing me...
d_ex_cafe_08_36,"Okay, fine."
d_ex_cafe_08_37,Are you ready for the most important step? Making the cookie dough.
d_ex_cafe_08_38,I've got this in the bag.
d_ex_cafe_08_39,Bay starts measuring the ingredients with a look of determination.
d_ex_cafe_08_40,200 grams of flour...
d_ex_cafe_08_41,*Swish*
d_ex_cafe_08_42,The scale displays exactly 200g.
d_ex_cafe_08_43,Sweet.
d_ex_cafe_08_44,And 100g of butter...
d_ex_cafe_08_45,Hmm...
d_ex_cafe_08_46,50g of sugar...
d_ex_cafe_08_47,"As the measurements stipulated by the recipe decrease, Bay's expression darkens."
d_ex_cafe_08_48,3g of yeast...
d_ex_cafe_08_49,*Swish*
d_ex_cafe_08_50,*Swooooosh*
d_ex_cafe_08_51,Oh no!
d_ex_cafe_08_52,"As Bay's hand trembles ever so slightly, a cascade of yeast powder spills onto the dough."
d_ex_cafe_08_53,Dang it... my hands slipped.
d_ex_cafe_08_54,"It's okay, you can just take some out."
d_ex_cafe_08_55,You're right!
d_ex_cafe_08_56,"Where's the spoon, Coach?"
d_ex_cafe_08_57,I saw one just a moment ago.
d_ex_cafe_08_58,I'll go get one.
d_ex_cafe_08_59,"No, I'll do it."
d_ex_cafe_08_60,Bay hastily finds a spoon and starts scooping out the excess powder from the dough.
d_ex_cafe_08_61,"Aw man, it's already mixed itself into the dough..."
d_ex_cafe_08_62,And I was doing so good following the recipe...
d_ex_cafe_08_63,"Now, I've gone and ruined it."
d_ex_cafe_08_64,I wouldn't say that.
d_ex_cafe_08_65,*Swooooosh*
d_ex_cafe_08_66,Emma lifts a bag of flour and pours it over the dough.
d_ex_cafe_08_67,!!
d_ex_cafe_08_68,What are you doing?!
d_ex_cafe_08_69,"Now, I'm the one who ruined it, not you."
d_ex_cafe_08_70,But still...
d_ex_cafe_08_71,"Bay, isn't making cookies fun?"
d_ex_cafe_08_72,!!
d_ex_cafe_08_73,Don't you think so?
d_ex_cafe_08_74,...
d_ex_cafe_08_75,Bay looks down at the ground and answers sheepishly.
d_ex_cafe_08_76,I'm not sure.
d_ex_cafe_08_77,"I mean,"
d_ex_cafe_08_78,I was excited at first.
d_ex_cafe_08_79,"The thought of being able to make delectable cookies really thrilled me,"
d_ex_cafe_08_80,as did the idea of sharing them with my friends.
d_ex_cafe_08_81,That's why I wanted them to be perfect.
d_ex_cafe_08_82,I was so obsessed with not making any mistakes
d_ex_cafe_08_83,that it was all I could think about.
d_ex_cafe_08_84,Bay...
d_ex_cafe_08_85,"Hehe, I see."
d_ex_cafe_08_86,"Well, at this point, I don't think we should bother with the recipe."
d_ex_cafe_08_87,*Swooosh*
d_ex_cafe_08_88,Emma pushes the sheet of paper to the side.
d_ex_cafe_08_89,!!
d_ex_cafe_08_90,Do you think we'll be able to make cookies without it?
d_ex_cafe_08_91,"Of course, we can!"
d_ex_cafe_08_92,"You're making me nervous, Emma..."
d_ex_cafe_08_93,"Hey, what are you talking about?"
d_ex_cafe_08_94,"You've always enjoyed my cooking, Commander."
d_ex_cafe_08_95,He has?
d_ex_cafe_08_96,... Yeah. I have.
d_ex_cafe_08_97,In that case...
d_ex_cafe_08_98,"I'll trust that you two know best, and give it another shot."
d_ex_cafe_08_99,"Hehe, good thinking."
d_ex_cafe_08_100,"Since we're gonna share these with our teammates, let's toss in loads of stamina-boosting ingredients."
d_ex_cafe_08_101,That's a great idea!
d_ex_cafe_08_102,A moment later.
d_ex_cafe_08_103,Every available table in the cafe is piled high with dark purple cookies that emit a strange fetid odor.
d_ex_cafe_08_104,These are the... strawberry cookies you mentioned?
d_ex_cafe_08_105,...
d_ex_cafe_08_106,Don't they look wonderful?
d_ex_cafe_08_107,Emma's eyes sparkle as she speaks.
d_ex_cafe_08_108,"Hurry up and try one, Bay."
d_ex_cafe_08_109,... Okay.
d_ex_cafe_08_110,Bay tentatively picks up the smallest cookie she can find and takes a bite.
d_ex_cafe_08_111,*Crunch*
d_ex_cafe_08_112,...!
d_ex_cafe_08_113,How is it?
d_ex_cafe_08_114,This flavor... it's unlike anything I've ever tasted...
d_ex_cafe_08_115,"Oh my goodness, what high praise!"
d_ex_cafe_08_116,Looks like this batch is another resounding success!
d_ex_cafe_08_117,"As Emma giggles and prances about giddily, Bay picks up another cookie."
d_ex_cafe_08_118,"You should try one as well, Coach."
d_ex_cafe_08_119,"I take a quick glance at the dark purple cookie,"
d_ex_cafe_08_120,"then at Emma's face,"
d_ex_cafe_08_121,and finally at Bay.
d_ex_cafe_08_122,... Okay.
d_ex_cafe_08_123,*Crunch*
d_ex_cafe_08_124,Ugh...
d_ex_cafe_08_125,My mouth is filled with a bizarre mixture of sweet and sour flavors.
d_ex_cafe_08_126,"In other words, the cookie tastes just as bad as the rest of Emma's usual cooking."
d_ex_cafe_08_127,Pfft...!
d_ex_cafe_08_128,Coach... your face...
d_ex_cafe_08_129,Pfft...!
d_ex_cafe_08_130,Hahahahahaha!
d_ex_cafe_08_131,!!
d_ex_cafe_08_132,"Oh my goodness, this is the first time I've seen Bay laugh like this."
d_ex_cafe_08_133,These cookies really are a smash hit!
d_ex_cafe_08_134,... You could say that.
d_ex_cafe_08_135,Hahaha!
d_ex_cafe_08_136,They truly are the perfect cookie.
d_ex_cafe_08_137,Bay's bout of laughter continues for a good long while.
d_ex_cafe_08_138,That was fun.
d_ex_cafe_08_139,How about we make some together again?
d_ex_cafe_08_140,You're going to make more?
d_ex_cafe_08_141,"Sure, why not? Are you going to join us?"
d_ex_cafe_08_142,... Sure.
d_ex_cafe_08_143,I think I might have to avoid Bay and Emma for a while.
d_ex_hospital_07_title,1% Chance
d_ex_hospital_07_01,"So overwhelming is my exhaustion, that I decide to take a quick nap on a park bench."
d_ex_hospital_07_02,When I open my eyes...
d_ex_hospital_07_03,Am I in the hospital?
d_ex_hospital_07_04,"Coach, are you back with us?"
d_ex_hospital_07_05,"Are you all right, Commander?"
d_ex_hospital_07_06,"As everything comes back into focus, I see Bay and Pepper staring down at me."
d_ex_hospital_07_07,Bay? Pepper? Why am I...
d_ex_hospital_07_08,Phew...
d_ex_hospital_07_09,Thank goodness you're okay!
d_ex_hospital_07_10,Both of them heave sighs of relief and slump into the chairs.
d_ex_hospital_07_11,How busy are you that you've got to sleep on a park bench?
d_ex_hospital_07_12,"I found you zonked out and couldn't get you to wake up, so I brought you to the Hospital."
d_ex_hospital_07_13,"Not only are you suffering from over-exhaustion, but malnutrition as well."
d_ex_hospital_07_14,"If Bay hadn't found you by sheer happenstance, things could have ended really badly for you!"
d_ex_hospital_07_15,"... Thanks, Bay."
d_ex_hospital_07_16,Don't mention it.
d_ex_hospital_07_17,"Anyway, you seem better now, so I better get going."
d_ex_hospital_07_18,"Just a moment, Bay!"
d_ex_hospital_07_19,How's that sprained leg of yours coming along?
d_ex_hospital_07_20,Er...
d_ex_hospital_07_21,Hmm? Why do you look so nervous?
d_ex_hospital_07_22,Did you not take any rest like I told you to?
d_ex_hospital_07_23,... Nope.
d_ex_hospital_07_24,"We've got a competition coming up soon, and I can't miss practice since I'm the squad leader."
d_ex_hospital_07_25,...
d_ex_hospital_07_26,"You may be a Nikke, but that doesn't exempt you from having to tend to any injuries you sustain."
d_ex_hospital_07_27,"If you try to rush through the recovery process,"
d_ex_hospital_07_28,your brain might misinterpret injuries as something normal.
d_ex_hospital_07_29,You could end up suffering from chronic pain!
d_ex_hospital_07_30,Chronic pain...?
d_ex_hospital_07_31,"Bay mumbles and lowers her head, withering under Pepper's accusatory gaze."
d_ex_hospital_07_32,"I feel much better now, honestly."
d_ex_hospital_07_33,Sounds to me like you're trying to brush this off...
d_ex_hospital_07_34,but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
d_ex_hospital_07_35,...
d_ex_hospital_07_36,"Um, Pepper?"
d_ex_hospital_07_37,Yes?
d_ex_hospital_07_38,Er... it's just that...
d_ex_hospital_07_39,It's okay. Take your time and talk to me slowly.
d_ex_hospital_07_40,I wanted to ask for a friend.
d_ex_hospital_07_41,The chronic pain that you're talking about...
d_ex_hospital_07_42,What do you do
d_ex_hospital_07_43,if you get an injury that never heals?
d_ex_hospital_07_44,Is there absolutely no chance of her leg improving?
d_ex_hospital_07_45,Not necessarily.
d_ex_hospital_07_46,It has gotten better as she has practiced.
d_ex_hospital_07_47,Hmm...
d_ex_hospital_07_48,If that's the case...
d_ex_hospital_07_49,...
d_ex_hospital_07_50,I would still say she ought to take things slow.
d_ex_hospital_07_51,!!
d_ex_hospital_07_52,"Even if there's only a 1% chance of it healing,"
d_ex_hospital_07_53,"even if she won't recover fully,"
d_ex_hospital_07_54,I would say that's more than enough motivation to try and get better.
d_ex_hospital_07_55,"Don't you think so, Commander?"
d_ex_hospital_07_56,I agree wholeheartedly.
d_ex_hospital_07_57,...
d_ex_hospital_07_58,"The next time you run into this friend of yours,"
d_ex_hospital_07_59,tell her that she can make it through this.
d_ex_hospital_07_60,"You're a cheerleader, after all,"
d_ex_hospital_07_61,so you'd do a better job motivating her than me.
d_ex_hospital_07_62,Pepper murmurs inaudibly under her breath so that Bay can't hear.
d_ex_hospital_07_63,You've got to motivate yourself.
d_ex_hospital_07_64,"... Okay, I'll tell them that."
d_ex_hospital_07_65,All right!
d_ex_hospital_07_66,"Well, I've got a consultation scheduled, so I better get going."
d_ex_hospital_07_67,"You can leave once your IV is finished, Commander."
d_ex_hospital_07_68,"And please, for goodness' sake, don't stretch yourself too thin!"
d_ex_hospital_07_69,"I won't. Thanks, Pepper."
d_ex_hospital_07_70,Pepper smiles and walks out of the room.
d_ex_hospital_07_71,It's high time I head out as well.
d_ex_hospital_07_72,I have something to do.
d_ex_hospital_07_73,More practice?
d_ex_hospital_07_74,"No, not that."
d_ex_hospital_07_75,Then what?
d_ex_hospital_07_76,I'm done cheering other people on.
d_ex_hospital_07_77,I think it's time I take some time to cheer myself on.
d_ex_hospital_07_78,Hang in there.
d_ex_hospital_07_79,I will cheer you on too.
d_ex_hospital_07_80,"Thanks, Coach. See you later."
d_ex_hospital_07_81,"As I watch Bay depart, her steps appear noticeably lighter, almost as if a weight has been lifted."
d_ex_toyshop_08_title,Special Pompoms
d_ex_toyshop_08_1,I arrive at the Toy Store after receiving Bay's call.
d_ex_toyshop_08_2,*Jingle*
d_ex_toyshop_08_3,"Welcome, Old-Timer."
d_ex_toyshop_08_4,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_08_5,"Oh, hello, Coach."
d_ex_toyshop_08_6,Seems like everyone's here.
d_ex_toyshop_08_7,"As they greet me warmly, I notice a big box in the room."
d_ex_toyshop_08_8,What's this box for?
d_ex_toyshop_08_9,Pompoms!
d_ex_toyshop_08_10,A whole box... full of them?
d_ex_toyshop_08_11,Yeah!
d_ex_toyshop_08_12,"Hehe, are there maybe a bit too many?"
d_ex_toyshop_08_13,"I ordered a special pompom for the cheerleading competition,"
d_ex_toyshop_08_14,and they've prepared so much for me.
d_ex_toyshop_08_15,"I gotta pick one of these, but it'd be a real pain to do it alone."
d_ex_toyshop_08_16,"So, I called you over to help."
d_ex_toyshop_08_17,"Since Bay's got her eyes set on this for the contest,"
d_ex_toyshop_08_18,we took special care in preparing this.
d_ex_toyshop_08_19,You can look forward to it!
d_ex_toyshop_08_20,Okay...
d_ex_toyshop_08_21,Shall we get started then?
d_ex_toyshop_08_22,Belorta rummages through the box and takes out a pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_23,Ta-da!
d_ex_toyshop_08_24,Huh? It just looks like a regular pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_25,"Keke. Of course, it isn't."
d_ex_toyshop_08_26,Go ahead and shake it!
d_ex_toyshop_08_27,*Flash*
d_ex_toyshop_08_28,"As I shake it, a light blinds me as if a flash bomb has just gone off right before me."
d_ex_toyshop_08_29,...!
d_ex_toyshop_08_30,My eyes...
d_ex_toyshop_08_31,This one's made of a special material. It flashes when you shake it.
d_ex_toyshop_08_32,"However, the brightness can't be adjusted."
d_ex_toyshop_08_33,... I don't think the judges will be able to see us clearly
d_ex_toyshop_08_34,if we use this pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_35,Hmm... Is that so?
d_ex_toyshop_08_36,Um... How about this one?
d_ex_toyshop_08_37,Mica takes out a smaller pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_38,"It's got a longer handle, so it won't slip out of your hands easily."
d_ex_toyshop_08_39,Doesn't it look good when I shake it?
d_ex_toyshop_08_40,Isn't this...
d_ex_toyshop_08_41,A feather duster?
d_ex_toyshop_08_42,Huh!? Is it?
d_ex_toyshop_08_43,It's so cute
d_ex_toyshop_08_44,that I thought it was a pompom... *Sob*
d_ex_toyshop_08_45,It doesn't matter.
d_ex_toyshop_08_46,"There's a ton of them, so let's keep digging."
d_ex_toyshop_08_47,"Hehe, okay!"
d_ex_toyshop_08_48,There must be one that you'll like!
d_ex_toyshop_08_49,But as more and more pompoms are taken out...
d_ex_toyshop_08_50,Hmm...
d_ex_toyshop_08_51,Mm-hmm!
d_ex_toyshop_08_52,Phew...
d_ex_toyshop_08_53,Bay's face becomes increasingly pale.
d_ex_toyshop_08_54,"*Sob* What should we do, Belorta?"
d_ex_toyshop_08_55,It seems like there aren't any pompoms that Bay likes.
d_ex_toyshop_08_56,I've shown her everything we've got...
d_ex_toyshop_08_57,"Had I known this would happen, I would've prepared more."
d_ex_toyshop_08_58,"In the box that used to be filled with a variety of pompoms,"
d_ex_toyshop_08_59,only an ordinary pink one remains.
d_ex_toyshop_08_60,There's still one left.
d_ex_toyshop_08_61,*Sob* Those won't make a difference.
d_ex_toyshop_08_62,"Yes, it's too plain to use in a contest!"
d_ex_toyshop_08_63,Hmm...
d_ex_toyshop_08_64,The color seems to go well with Rewind...
d_ex_toyshop_08_65,"After pondering for a while, Bay takes out the pompom and shakes it gently."
d_ex_toyshop_08_66,It's so pretty!
d_ex_toyshop_08_67,"Every time she shakes it, specks of colored confetti scatter from the pompom."
d_ex_toyshop_08_68,I wanna rehearse with it for a bit. Can you help me check how it turns out?
d_ex_toyshop_08_69,Here? Now?
d_ex_toyshop_08_70,"Yeah, I'd like to hear your opinions."
d_ex_toyshop_08_71,Got it.
d_ex_toyshop_08_72,Bay starts a cheerleading routine with the pink pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_73,Go! Go! Victory! Go! Go! Victory!
d_ex_toyshop_08_74,You can do it!
d_ex_toyshop_08_75,*Spin*
d_ex_toyshop_08_76,Cheer up!
d_ex_toyshop_08_77,*Whoosh*
d_ex_toyshop_08_78,"With the final cheer, she raises the pompom high,"
d_ex_toyshop_08_79,and paper confetti scatters over her head like a shower of flower petals.
d_ex_toyshop_08_80,*Huff huff*
d_ex_toyshop_08_81,How was it?
d_ex_toyshop_08_82,"Wow, it was like you were dancing in a rain of flowers!"
d_ex_toyshop_08_83,"Hehe, it looks amazing!"
d_ex_toyshop_08_84,That's right!
d_ex_toyshop_08_85,Your cheerleading routine
d_ex_toyshop_08_86,made this normal-looking pompom
d_ex_toyshop_08_87,so special!
d_ex_toyshop_08_88,...!!
d_ex_toyshop_08_89,I'm flattered...
d_ex_toyshop_08_90,"Bay must be tired, Old-Timer."
d_ex_toyshop_08_91,Her face has gone all red!
d_ex_toyshop_08_92,She's all right. It must be something else.
d_ex_toyshop_08_93,"Naw, Bay's sooo cute!"
d_ex_toyshop_08_94,Bay cradles the pompoms in her arms tightly before speaking.
d_ex_toyshop_08_95,"Thank you, everyone."
d_ex_toyshop_08_96,I'll try my best to practice with this pompom.
d_ex_toyshop_08_97,We'll be cheering for you.
d_ex_toyshop_08_98,Good luck!
d_ex_toyshop_08_99,You can do it!
d_ex_toyshop_08_100,Some time later.
d_ex_toyshop_08_101,There's some buzz on social media about Rewind winning the cheerleading contest.
d_ex_toyshop_08_102,They've even got this picture of Bay beaming under a cascade of colorful confetti.
d_ex_police_08_title,A Parking Spot for T.A.L.O.S.
d_ex_police_08_1,"After receiving a sudden phone call from Poli, I find myself heading towards the police station."
d_ex_police_08_2,T.A.L.O.S.?
d_ex_police_08_3,"Hello, Commander."
d_ex_police_08_4,What are you doing here?
d_ex_police_08_5,I am waiting for Kilo.
d_ex_police_08_6,I see.
d_ex_police_08_7,"Something doesn't feel quite right about this, but I decide to ignore it and head to the police station."
d_ex_police_08_8,*Zing*
d_ex_police_08_10,Le-let me out!
d_ex_police_08_11,I'm afraid I can't.
d_ex_police_08_12,Parking illegally is a major felony.
d_ex_police_08_13,"No, they're not. Traffic violations are misdemeanors."
d_ex_police_08_14,"Oh, is that right?"
d_ex_police_08_15,You hear that? Parking illegally is a misdemeanor!
d_ex_police_08_16,"If it's just a misdemeanor, why are you locking me up?"
d_ex_police_08_17,Because it's a traffic violation!
d_ex_police_08_18,I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall!
d_ex_police_08_19,"Also, I never illegally parked in the first place!"
d_ex_police_08_20,"How can you say that?
It's parked right in front of the police station as we speak!"
d_ex_police_08_21,I didn't park there. I just stopped there for a second.
d_ex_police_08_22,"If that's not illegal parking, then what would you call it?"
d_ex_police_08_23,"Argh! Commander, you've gotta help me!"
d_ex_police_08_24,What's going on here?
d_ex_police_08_25,"Hi, Commander."
d_ex_police_08_26,Hm...
d_ex_police_08_27,"I should mention that holding Kilo in detention was Miranda's decision.
We'll be releasing her shortly."
d_ex_police_08_28,"However, did you see that thing outside?"
d_ex_police_08_29,"Do you mean T.A.L.O.S.? Yeah, I did."
d_ex_police_08_30,T.A.L.O.S.? Is that what it's called?
d_ex_police_08_31,We've had a steady stream of complaints about it lately.
d_ex_police_08_32,"""It keeps blocking the way when I'm riding with my Partner.
Let's see who is faster next time!"""
d_ex_police_08_33,"""I thought it was a building and tried to go in, but I kept bumping into it and now my forehead hurts."""
d_ex_police_08_34,Like this.
d_ex_police_08_35,...It seems like the last one was written by someone working at the police station...
d_ex_police_08_36,"I called Kilo over to hear her side of the story,"
d_ex_police_08_37,but she refuses to talk and instead keeps asking for you.
d_ex_police_08_38,I suppose I can see why she's upset. We may have been a bit hasty in holding her.
d_ex_police_08_39,"Miranda, can you let Kilo out?"
d_ex_police_08_40,I'll do no such thing!
d_ex_police_08_41,"Before I even consider that, we need to resolve this illegal parking issue."
d_ex_police_08_42,"Miranda, if you want her to move that robot, don't you think you'll have to let her out?"
d_ex_police_08_43,"Oh...yeah, I guess you're right."
d_ex_police_08_44,"All right, I'll let her out."
d_ex_police_08_45,*Click*
d_ex_police_08_46,"Thank goodness! Oh, Commander, I was so scared!"
d_ex_police_08_47,This must have been quite a traumatic experience for you.
d_ex_police_08_48,It sure was. Thank you again.
d_ex_police_08_49,Hmm...
d_ex_police_08_50,"Now, about all these complaints."
d_ex_police_08_51,Is there perhaps a separate area somewhere in the Outpost where I can leave T.A.L.O.S.?
d_ex_police_08_52,The last thing I want is to be an imposition to anyone.
d_ex_police_08_53,So you're using T.A.L.O.S. to get around?
d_ex_police_08_54,Correct.
d_ex_police_08_55,This is the first time I've seen someone use such a large means of transportation.
d_ex_police_08_56,"Rather than run around creating designated parking spaces,"
d_ex_police_08_57,"I'm willing to bet there's more than enough space
near most of the buildings here for T.A.L.O.S."
d_ex_police_08_58,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_ex_police_08_59,I think that's a brilliant idea.
d_ex_police_08_60,Oh...!
d_ex_police_08_61,I think that's a great idea as well!
d_ex_police_08_62,"Finally, a police officer I can reason with."
d_ex_police_08_63,What a relief.
d_ex_police_08_64,Oh...
d_ex_police_08_65,"Hehe, I hardly think that suggestion was worthy of such effusive praise,
but thank you nonetheless."
d_ex_police_08_66,So where should we place T.A.L.O.S. here at the station?
d_ex_police_08_67,"You left him near this corner outside, right?"
d_ex_police_08_68,Yeah.
d_ex_police_08_69,"It's not really obstructing traffic, and it's not sticking out dangerously,
so I think it should be fine where it is."
d_ex_police_08_70,Let's just leave it there.
d_ex_police_08_71,"Okay, thanks!"
d_ex_police_08_72,Huh?
d_ex_police_08_73,So are we not considering this illegal parking?
d_ex_police_08_74,Nope.
d_ex_police_08_75,...Okay!
d_ex_police_08_76,Drive safely!
d_ex_police_08_77,...
d_ex_police_08_78,You changed your tune awfully quickly.
d_ex_police_08_79,Naturally!
d_ex_police_08_80,It's a police officer's duty to be kind to the populace.
d_ex_police_08_81,...Right.
d_ex_police_08_82,You must not have considered me part of the populace before...
d_ex_police_08_83,"Anyway, thanks. I'll be more careful from now on."
d_ex_police_08_84,"Thanks, we appreciate it."
d_ex_police_08_85,"We head out of the police station,"
d_ex_police_08_86,"and proceed to circle the Outpost together,
looking for suitable places near each building where Kilo can leave T.A.L.O.S."
d_ex_library_08_title,Robot Maintenance Manual
d_ex_library_08_1,Hmm...
d_ex_library_08_2,Is this the way?
d_ex_library_08_3,Huh?
d_ex_library_08_4,"Hi, Commander."
d_ex_library_08_5,"Hi, Kilo."
d_ex_library_08_6,What are you up to?
d_ex_library_08_7,Just reading a good book.
d_ex_library_08_8,"Oh, okay."
d_ex_library_08_9,"Well, enjoy your book."
d_ex_library_08_10,Are you not here to read?
d_ex_library_08_11,"I am, but..."
d_ex_library_08_12,It's a bit...
d_ex_library_08_13,What's wrong? Are you looking for a book that's...you're not at liberty to discuss?
d_ex_library_08_14,No! It's nothing like that.
d_ex_library_08_15,Er...
d_ex_library_08_16,There you are.
d_ex_library_08_17,Gah! Where did you come from?
d_ex_library_08_18,Guillotine?
d_ex_library_08_19,I should have known that you would find her
d_ex_library_08_20,"before I did, Partner."
d_ex_library_08_21,"Having said that, it would appear that you still have not obtained ""it""."
d_ex_library_08_22,?
d_ex_library_08_23,"Now, fess up. Tell me what you know."
d_ex_library_08_24,What?
d_ex_library_08_25,I don't know what you're talking about.
d_ex_library_08_26,Ha! You won't fool me with such playacting!
d_ex_library_08_27,Tell me the truth.
d_ex_library_08_28,I know you're looking for the Book of Darkness.
d_ex_library_08_29,Book of Darkness?
d_ex_library_08_30,I've never even heard of such a thing.
d_ex_library_08_31,Very well.
d_ex_library_08_32,You leave me with no choice.
d_ex_library_08_33,Wha...?
d_ex_library_08_34,The truth...
d_ex_library_08_35,Out with it! Hyah!
d_ex_library_08_36,Gah!
d_ex_library_08_37,...
d_ex_library_08_38,What was that?
d_ex_library_08_39,"Now, you will find yourself incapable of lying."
d_ex_library_08_40,So go on then.
d_ex_library_08_41,Where is the Book of Darkness?
d_ex_library_08_42,I told you I don't even know what that is!
d_ex_library_08_43,I'm looking for a robot maintenance manual.
d_ex_library_08_44,You are?
d_ex_library_08_45,Yes.
d_ex_library_08_46,You know how much I rely on T.A.L.O.S.
d_ex_library_08_47,"If something were to happen to him,
or if he broke down,"
d_ex_library_08_48,"I should at least know how to do basic repairs
to keep it operational."
d_ex_library_08_49,...
d_ex_library_08_50,"Last time, T.A.L.O.S. had a malfunction,
and I wasn't even able to finish the test."
d_ex_library_08_51,I was totally helpless.
d_ex_library_08_52,...
d_ex_library_08_53,...
d_ex_library_08_54,"More than helpless, I realized I was incompetent."
d_ex_library_08_55,I have to do something.
d_ex_library_08_56,No one said you were incompetent.
d_ex_library_08_57,?
d_ex_library_08_58,Very well. It's becoming clear that you are not the one I was looking for.
d_ex_library_08_59,I've wasted my time here.
d_ex_library_08_60,"Not at all. Thanks to your magic,
I was able to learn more about Kilo."
d_ex_library_08_61,Heh.
d_ex_library_08_62,I'm glad I was able to be of assistance.
d_ex_library_08_63,"Anyway, the book you're looking for is probably in the next aisle over."
d_ex_library_08_64,"I'm rather busy, so I must get going."
d_ex_library_08_65,Guillotine retreats from the library by walking backward.
d_ex_library_08_66,...
d_ex_library_08_67,Who was that strange person?
d_ex_library_08_68,You don't know the half of it. That wasn't nearly as abnormal as she usually is.
d_ex_library_08_69,?
d_ex_library_08_70,"Anyway, let's look for that manual."
d_ex_library_08_71,Oh...!
d_ex_library_08_72,"Oh, you don't have to help me!"
d_ex_library_08_73,It's all right. I could learn something from perusing that manual as well.
d_ex_library_08_74,"Also, you're not incompetent,
so don't let me hear that kind of talk from you again."
d_ex_library_08_75,...
d_ex_library_08_76,All right.
d_ex_library_08_77,"Thank you for your kind words, Commander."
d_ex_library_08_78,Kilo and I spend time studying in the library together.
d_ex_armory_07_title,Big Weapons for a Big Robot
d_ex_armory_07_1,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_07_2,He-Hello...
d_ex_armory_07_3,...
d_ex_armory_07_4,A new face.
d_ex_armory_07_5,And this is...
d_ex_armory_07_6,"Hello, Eunhwa."
d_ex_armory_07_7,"Ugh, Weakling again."
d_ex_armory_07_8,"What do you mean by ""again""?"
d_ex_armory_07_9,"I'm usually nestled inside T.A.L.O.S., so that's probably why you don't recognize me."
d_ex_armory_07_10,"I'm Kilo, nice to meet you!"
d_ex_armory_07_11,What are you doing here?
d_ex_armory_07_12,I came to see some weapons.
d_ex_armory_07_13,"Mine has a broken part, but before I send it off for repairs,
the Commander suggested I come here."
d_ex_armory_07_14,"He said you have just about everything here
that one can imagine when it comes to weaponry."
d_ex_armory_07_15,Did you tell her that?
d_ex_armory_07_16,Hehe.
d_ex_armory_07_17,...
d_ex_armory_07_18,Fine. Do it.
d_ex_armory_07_19,Huh?
d_ex_armory_07_20,She means to feel free to look around.
d_ex_armory_07_21,"Oh, gotcha."
d_ex_armory_07_22,Thanks!
d_ex_armory_07_23,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_07_24,Hmmmm...
d_ex_armory_07_25,"Um, Eunhwa?"
d_ex_armory_07_26,What?
d_ex_armory_07_27,I don't think these are quite the size I'm looking for.
d_ex_armory_07_28,Do you perhaps have them in any other size?
d_ex_armory_07_29,...
d_ex_armory_07_30,"Yes, those are a bit big
for a pipsqueak like you."
d_ex_armory_07_31,"If you go inside and head to the left, there should be some that are more your size."
d_ex_armory_07_32,"Okay, thanks!"
d_ex_armory_07_33,...
d_ex_armory_07_34,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_07_35,"Sorry to bother you again, but..."
d_ex_armory_07_36,...What?
d_ex_armory_07_37,"These are maybe a tad too small, actually."
d_ex_armory_07_38,Do you have anything bigger?
d_ex_armory_07_39,Bigger?
d_ex_armory_07_40,"Do you think a little squirt like you
can handle something that big?"
d_ex_armory_07_41,Oh...!
d_ex_armory_07_42,It's not actually meant for me.
d_ex_armory_07_43,What do you mean?
d_ex_armory_07_44,Explain.
d_ex_armory_07_45,"Oh, so..."
d_ex_armory_07_46,I'm looking for a weapon for T.A.L.O.S.
d_ex_armory_07_47,Then why don't you ask this T.A.L.O.S. to come in themselves?
d_ex_armory_07_48,"Well, T.A.L.O.S. is a robot,
and it might be a tight squeeze for them inside here."
d_ex_armory_07_49,"If a person sends someone else to do
their dirty work simply because they're too big to"
d_ex_armory_07_50,"come inside the storage room, then they don't deserve to use the weapons I have for sale."
d_ex_armory_07_51,"So, either they drag their fat butt in here,"
d_ex_armory_07_52,or you get lost.
d_ex_armory_07_53,Oh...
d_ex_armory_07_54,So...are you saying that it's okay for T.A.L.O.S. to come inside?
d_ex_armory_07_55,"In that case, I'll be right back!"
d_ex_armory_07_56,Kilo quickly heads out of the weapons storage room.
d_ex_armory_07_57,...
d_ex_armory_07_58,"I suppose you find it amusing to while away your time
with moronic characters like this, Weakling?"
d_ex_armory_07_59,"How could someone hand over their weapon to someone else
for such a ridiculous reason?"
d_ex_armory_07_60,It's inconceivable to me.
d_ex_armory_07_61,Your concept of what is and isn't conceivable may not be exactly normal...
d_ex_armory_07_62,What was that?
d_ex_armory_07_63,*Thump thump*
d_ex_armory_07_64,What the...what is that?
d_ex_armory_07_66,We're here!
d_ex_armory_07_67,...
d_ex_armory_07_68,"This is my friend, T.A.L.O.S."
d_ex_armory_07_69,I was wondering if you had anything here that could replace the weapon on its right arm.
d_ex_armory_07_70,...Just when I think things can't get any more absurd.
d_ex_armory_07_71,"All the weapons here are for regular Nikkes.
I don't have anything meant to be wielded by that lumbering bucket of bolts."
d_ex_armory_07_72,Preparing to scan for large-scale weapons inside the armory.
d_ex_armory_07_73,Permission to proceed?
d_ex_armory_07_74,Don't you dare.
d_ex_armory_07_75,Granted.
d_ex_armory_07_76,...
d_ex_armory_07_77,Scanning.
d_ex_armory_07_78,Scan complete.
d_ex_armory_07_79,"There is one weapon in the armory which bears a 76.83% match
with my currently equipped weapon."
d_ex_armory_07_80,Really?
d_ex_armory_07_81,Correct. Shall I proceed to said weapon?
d_ex_armory_07_82,"Actually, wait just a moment."
d_ex_armory_07_83,"T.A.L.O.S., open cockpit."
d_ex_armory_07_84,*Pooshook*
d_ex_armory_07_85,Ungh...
d_ex_armory_07_86,I'm sorry for scanning without your permission.
d_ex_armory_07_87,The voice recognition system must have reacted to the Commander's order.
d_ex_armory_07_88,...
d_ex_armory_07_89,"A-Anyway...you seem to have a suitable weapon for us,
so...would it be possible for us to have a look?"
d_ex_armory_07_90,"T.A.L.O.S.' weapons usually have to be custom made,
so it's a real challenge to find something pre-made like this."
d_ex_armory_07_91,*Sigh*
d_ex_armory_07_92,"Is this why you brought her here, Weakling?"
d_ex_armory_07_93,"Can you help us out, Eunhwa?"
d_ex_armory_07_94,Fine. Just this once.
d_ex_armory_07_95,Follow me.
d_ex_armory_07_96,Oh...!
d_ex_armory_07_97,Thank you so much!
d_ex_armory_07_98,...Can I take a look at that robot's weapons later?
d_ex_armory_07_99,Sure! Feel free.
d_ex_armory_07_100,"Kilo and Eunhwa head into the armory
and don't come out for a while."
d_ex_armory_07_101,"Surprisingly, their interests seem to align quite closely."
d_ex_armory_07_102,What a relief...
d_ex_powerplant_07_title,Hero 101!
d_ex_powerplant_07_1,I can hear a major ruckus coming from the generator.
d_ex_powerplant_07_2,I should head over to investigate.
d_ex_powerplant_07_3,"Hahaha! All right, I'll get straight to the basics,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_4,so concentrate!
d_ex_powerplant_07_5,O-okay...
d_ex_powerplant_07_6,?
d_ex_powerplant_07_7,What are you two doing?
d_ex_powerplant_07_8,"Well, if it isn't Birdie!"
d_ex_powerplant_07_9,What brings you here?
d_ex_powerplant_07_10,I asked you first...
d_ex_powerplant_07_11,"Anyway, there was so much noise coming from over here that I had to check it out."
d_ex_powerplant_07_12,"Ah, I see."
d_ex_powerplant_07_13,What are you guys up to?
d_ex_powerplant_07_14,Um...
d_ex_powerplant_07_15,"Elegg and Maxwell went to check on the generator,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_16,so I had to wait here with Laplace.
d_ex_powerplant_07_17,And that's how I came to find out
d_ex_powerplant_07_18,that Trony idolizes heroes like me!
d_ex_powerplant_07_19,That's not what I said.
d_ex_powerplant_07_20,I said I like the Ark Rangers.
d_ex_powerplant_07_21,It was then and there
d_ex_powerplant_07_22,that I decided to make Trony a hero!
d_ex_powerplant_07_23,But I'm not interested in becoming a hero...
d_ex_powerplant_07_24,Haha! First lesson!
d_ex_powerplant_07_25,A hero is never meek with their words!
d_ex_powerplant_07_26,Er...
d_ex_powerplant_07_27,... Sure?
d_ex_powerplant_07_28,"I will go through the basics,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_29,so listen attentively. Hahaha!
d_ex_powerplant_07_30,... Okay.
d_ex_powerplant_07_31,"With that, Laplace's hero class is in session."
d_ex_powerplant_07_32,The second thing you need to remember is that
d_ex_powerplant_07_33,"a hero must be ready to act at any time,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_34,and always keep a cool head!
d_ex_powerplant_07_35,Let me demonstrate!
d_ex_powerplant_07_36,Heroic dispatch!
d_ex_powerplant_07_37,*Crash*
d_ex_powerplant_07_38,Laplace tosses herself out of the window.
d_ex_powerplant_07_39,...
d_ex_powerplant_07_40,Feel free to ignore this—
d_ex_powerplant_07_41,That...
d_ex_powerplant_07_42,was the coolest thing I've ever seen! A true hero!
d_ex_powerplant_07_43,...
d_ex_powerplant_07_44,Heroic return!
d_ex_powerplant_07_45,*Crash*
d_ex_powerplant_07_46,Laplace crashes through another window.
d_ex_powerplant_07_47,"All right,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_48,"your turn now,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_49,Trony!
d_ex_powerplant_07_50,Okay!
d_ex_powerplant_07_51,Trony tightly clenches both fists and stares at one of the few windows which is still intact.
d_ex_powerplant_07_52,"With both eyes tightly shut,"
d_ex_powerplant_07_53,she charges toward the window.
d_ex_powerplant_07_54,*Bang*
d_ex_powerplant_07_55,Bang? Shouldn't it be a crash?
d_ex_powerplant_07_56,Ouch...
d_ex_powerplant_07_57,Tears well up in Trony's eyes as she hit her head against the window.
d_ex_powerplant_07_58,...
d_ex_powerplant_07_59,...
d_ex_powerplant_07_60,Ugh... that hurts...
d_ex_powerplant_07_61,"In any case, since it's nothing serious, I can just head back."
d_ex_elevator_07_title,The Elevator Ghost
d_ex_elevator_07_1,"I have an urgent meeting to attend,"
d_ex_elevator_07_2,so I stand in front of the elevator that will take me to the Ark.
d_ex_elevator_07_3,*Brrrr*
d_ex_elevator_07_4,"Oh, hey, Partner!"
d_ex_elevator_07_5,I notice Sugar getting off her bike
d_ex_elevator_07_6,that was loaded with several packages.
d_ex_elevator_07_7,What are all these packages?
d_ex_elevator_07_8,"A request came in for a delivery,"
d_ex_elevator_07_9,and I'm supposed to meet them here.
d_ex_elevator_07_10,I was going to wait for the elevator
d_ex_elevator_07_11,"but as you can see,"
d_ex_elevator_07_12,it doesn't seem to be working.
d_ex_elevator_07_13,"Jeez, is it broken again?"
d_ex_elevator_07_14,Hmm...
d_ex_elevator_07_15,"Come to think of it, there's a rumor about this elevator."
d_ex_elevator_07_16,Strange laughter can sometimes be heard coming from the elevator when it's faulty.
d_ex_elevator_07_17,Hehe. Hehehe.
d_ex_elevator_07_18,"Y'know, like that."
d_ex_elevator_07_19,"If you're trying to scare me, you can stop."
d_ex_elevator_07_20,You don't have to be scared.
d_ex_elevator_07_21,It's just a silly ghost story. Nothing to take seriously.
d_ex_elevator_07_22,"Anyway, can I ask you for a favor?"
d_ex_elevator_07_23,What is it?
d_ex_elevator_07_24,I've got another delivery I need to make.
d_ex_elevator_07_25,Can you take these packages to Cafe Sweety for me?
d_ex_elevator_07_26,Sure.
d_ex_elevator_07_27,Thanks a million.
d_ex_elevator_07_28,I'll put it on their tab.
d_ex_elevator_07_29,I know Milk is good for it.
d_ex_elevator_07_30,... Do as you please.
d_ex_elevator_07_31,*Brrrrr*
d_ex_elevator_07_32,Sugar takes off on Black Typhoon.
d_ex_elevator_07_33,...
d_ex_elevator_07_34,"Despite myself, Sugar's ghost tale has gotten under my skin."
d_ex_elevator_07_35,"They're just rumors. Like she said, there's nothing to be afraid of."
d_ex_elevator_07_36,"At that exact moment, the elevator starts moving."
d_ex_elevator_07_37,*Clunk*
d_ex_elevator_07_38,The elevator doors soon open.
d_ex_elevator_07_39,Hehe. Hehehe.
d_ex_elevator_07_40,Strange laughter can be heard from inside.
d_ex_elevator_07_41,!!
d_ex_elevator_07_42,Hehe. Hehehe.
d_ex_elevator_07_43,"Inside, Trony can be seen laughing at a video game cutscene."
d_ex_elevator_07_44,...
d_ex_elevator_07_45,"What are you doing in there, Trony?"
d_ex_elevator_07_46,...?
d_ex_elevator_07_47,C-Commander?
d_ex_elevator_07_48,I should be the one asking that...
d_ex_elevator_07_49,I'm waiting for the elevator.
d_ex_elevator_07_50,Oh...
d_ex_elevator_07_51,"Makes sense, I guess."
d_ex_elevator_07_52,"Trony, did you, by any chance, put in a request with Cafe Sweety?"
d_ex_elevator_07_53,"Uh, yes..."
d_ex_elevator_07_54,Why?
d_ex_elevator_07_55,Here it is. You can check to make sure it's all there.
d_ex_elevator_07_56,You're working for Cafe Sweety?
d_ex_elevator_07_57,That's right. I'm a solver for Cafe Sweety. Mix is the name.
d_ex_elevator_07_58,"Eyeing me somewhat skeptically, Trony begins to open the packages."
d_ex_elevator_07_59,"Inside are some Ark Ranger comics,"
d_ex_elevator_07_60,"various game consoles,"
d_ex_elevator_07_61,"cup noodles, coffee makers, and other various items."
d_ex_elevator_07_62,Great. It's all here.
d_ex_elevator_07_63,Can I ask something?
d_ex_elevator_07_64,Why do you need them to deliver all this stuff at the elevator?
d_ex_elevator_07_65,Um...
d_ex_elevator_07_66,"Last time I was at the Outpost,"
d_ex_elevator_07_67,the elevator broke down and I was trapped inside alone.
d_ex_elevator_07_68,"So, I thought"
d_ex_elevator_07_69,it'd be really nice to have a space of my own.
d_ex_elevator_07_70,"When I'm in here, I don't have to deal with Syuen nagging me about playing video games..."
d_ex_elevator_07_71,"Whenever I want some time to myself, I come here and hang out in the elevator for a while."
d_ex_elevator_07_72,...
d_ex_elevator_07_73,"So, you're the elevator ghost."
d_ex_elevator_07_74,Huh?
d_ex_elevator_07_75,"Nothing. As long as you're happy, that's all that matters."
d_ex_elevator_07_76,Hehe.
d_ex_elevator_07_77,"Oh! Mix,"
d_ex_elevator_07_78,should I make you some cup noodles too?
d_ex_elevator_07_79,Mix?
d_ex_elevator_07_80,Didn't you say that was your alias?
d_ex_elevator_07_81,While the situation is exceedingly odd...
d_ex_elevator_07_82,...
d_ex_elevator_07_83,at least Trony seems happy.
d_ex_workshop_09_title,The Limit of Technology
d_ex_workshop_09_1,"At Trony's request, I accompany her to the Workshop."
d_ex_workshop_09_2,"What brings you here, Greenhorn?"
d_ex_workshop_09_3,Trony asked me to come.
d_ex_workshop_09_4,"Um... Hi, Liter."
d_ex_workshop_09_5,"Hey there, Kiddo. It's been a while since I've seen you out of your cave."
d_ex_workshop_09_6,You know I don't like you calling me that...
d_ex_workshop_09_7,"So, what is it that you need this time?"
d_ex_workshop_09_8,"I'm thinking of adding a few more features to my gaming desk,"
d_ex_workshop_09_9,and I wanted to get your advice.
d_ex_workshop_09_10,You're trying to add even more features to that thing?
d_ex_workshop_09_11,You keep adding strange features to that desk...
d_ex_workshop_09_12,"At this rate, you're never going to leave your room."
d_ex_workshop_09_13,Haven't I told you?
d_ex_workshop_09_14,You need to step outside and get some fresh air sometimes!
d_ex_workshop_09_15,*Sigh* Again with the nagging.
d_ex_workshop_09_16,What do you mean!?
d_ex_workshop_09_17,I'm saying this for your own good!
d_ex_workshop_09_18,Sounds like you've already added quite a few features to your gaming setup.
d_ex_workshop_09_19,"Yeah, for starters,"
d_ex_workshop_09_20,all sorts of gadgets that help with managing basic tasks.
d_ex_workshop_09_21,"For example, I rigged my chair with heating and cooling systems"
d_ex_workshop_09_22,to regulate my body temperature so that it won't affect my performance.
d_ex_workshop_09_23,"I also thought I might feel like eating something during a session, so I put in a refrigerator."
d_ex_workshop_09_24,... How'd you manage to fit a fridge in there?
d_ex_workshop_09_25,...
d_ex_workshop_09_26,That's a secret.
d_ex_workshop_09_27,Is that all?!
d_ex_workshop_09_28,You should add a cleaning feature while you're at it since you're too lazy to clean your own room.
d_ex_workshop_09_29,Didn't you also install a jamming device to fend off any unwanted calls?
d_ex_workshop_09_30,What's up with that?
d_ex_workshop_09_31,It's just...
d_ex_workshop_09_32,I hate getting calls from Syuen.
d_ex_workshop_09_33,Trony.
d_ex_workshop_09_34,Yeah?
d_ex_workshop_09_35,Can you make that desk for me?
d_ex_workshop_09_36,"You want to use it too, Commander? Hehe."
d_ex_workshop_09_37,"If I had that desk, I could stay in my room and play games all day."
d_ex_workshop_09_38,Hey! Don't go putting any ideas in his head!
d_ex_workshop_09_39,"Anyway, what is it this time?"
d_ex_workshop_09_40,"It better not be something weird,"
d_ex_workshop_09_41,or else you can count me out!
d_ex_workshop_09_42,It's not weird...
d_ex_workshop_09_43,Uh...
d_ex_workshop_09_44,I was thinking of adding a feature to cut off the surrounding power.
d_ex_workshop_09_45,What?
d_ex_workshop_09_46,Why in the world would you need something like that?
d_ex_workshop_09_47,J-just out of curiosity.
d_ex_workshop_09_48,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_09_49,I want to see how far Missilis' technology can go.
d_ex_workshop_09_50,That...
d_ex_workshop_09_51,is a great idea!
d_ex_workshop_09_52,I love that you're so interested in pushing the technology to its limits.
d_ex_workshop_09_53,It's been a while since I've been this excited about something!
d_ex_workshop_09_54,"All right, I'm in."
d_ex_workshop_09_55,Yes!
d_ex_workshop_09_56,"Here, I've drawn up some blueprints."
d_ex_workshop_09_57,"As Trony and Liter look through the blueprints and start to talk shop,"
d_ex_workshop_09_58,I'm completely lost as to what they're discussing.
d_ex_workshop_09_59,I'll just sit here quietly.
d_ex_workshop_09_60,How about this?
d_ex_workshop_09_61,Whoa!
d_ex_workshop_09_62,"As Trony manipulates the newly furnished keyboard attached to the desk, the workshop lights flicker and then turn off."
d_ex_workshop_09_63,"Hey, what did you do?!"
d_ex_workshop_09_64,Don't go switching off the power in the Workshop!
d_ex_workshop_09_65,Sorry. I was just curious if it works.
d_ex_workshop_09_66,It certainly seems like it.
d_ex_workshop_09_67,"Of course, one should never doubt Missilis' technology."
d_ex_workshop_09_68,There's nothing we can't do!
d_ex_workshop_09_69,I can see that!
d_ex_workshop_09_70,"Now, I can use this whenever I'm too lazy to get up and turn off the lights."
d_ex_workshop_09_71,Huh?
d_ex_workshop_09_72,Or when I'm about to lose to Elegg again.
d_ex_workshop_09_73,Hehe.
d_ex_workshop_09_74,You little scamp! You tricked me!
d_ex_workshop_09_75,Hehehe.
d_ex_workshop_09_76,...
d_ex_workshop_09_77,There's an old saying that most technological advances are borne out of a desire to alleviate discomfort.
d_ex_workshop_09_78,I'm reminded once again of how true adages can be.
d_ex_hotel_09_title,Information about Rabbit
d_ex_hotel_09_1,"For once, it's a quiet afternoon."
d_ex_hotel_09_2,"In a rare turn of events, I have no work to do, and no one is looking for me."
d_ex_hotel_09_3,I should do whatever I can to savor this opport...
d_ex_hotel_09_4,"Rabbity,"
d_ex_hotel_09_5,there you are!
d_ex_hotel_09_6,I finally found you!
d_ex_hotel_09_7,Alice runs towards me holding a large bag.
d_ex_hotel_09_8,"Hey, Alice... what's going on?"
d_ex_hotel_09_9,I've got a favor to ask you.
d_ex_hotel_09_10,Can you go to the Hotel with me?
d_ex_hotel_09_11,Why?
d_ex_hotel_09_12,I was invited there by someone.
d_ex_hotel_09_13,"They said they're gaga for rabbits, and they were hoping I'd dress up like one and we could talk."
d_ex_hotel_09_14,So you need to come with me!
d_ex_hotel_09_15,Huh? Why do I need to go?
d_ex_hotel_09_16,Because you're Rabbity! You probably know more about rabbits than anyone else I know.
d_ex_hotel_09_17,"This is all rather sudden, but I don't feel entirely comfortable sending Alice to the Hotel on her own."
d_ex_hotel_09_18,"Okay, let's go."
d_ex_hotel_09_19,I knew you'd agree to it!
d_ex_hotel_09_20,"Let's hurry, or else we might be late."
d_ex_hotel_09_21,Alice grabs my hand and takes off.
d_ex_hotel_09_22,I don't see anyone here...
d_ex_hotel_09_23,Hello there.
d_ex_hotel_09_24,D?
d_ex_hotel_09_25,"Hello! You're the one who likes rabbits, right?"
d_ex_hotel_09_26,"Yep, that's me."
d_ex_hotel_09_27,Who's this you came with?
d_ex_hotel_09_28,I'm her guardian.
d_ex_hotel_09_29,Her guardian? You look awfully young to be looking after someone her age.
d_ex_hotel_09_30,"I was intending to have a conversation between the two of us, but I suppose there's not much I can do now that you're here."
d_ex_hotel_09_31,"Very well then, Alice, should we start talking about rabbits?"
d_ex_hotel_09_32,Sounds good!
d_ex_hotel_09_33,"Oh, just a moment. I prepared something."
d_ex_hotel_09_34,Really? Consider me intrigued.
d_ex_hotel_09_35,Alice puts her bag down and starts to pull out various items from it.
d_ex_hotel_09_36,"D, why did you call Alice out?"
d_ex_hotel_09_37,Didn't she tell you?
d_ex_hotel_09_38,I simply adore rabbits.
d_ex_hotel_09_39,Alice can't hear us right now. You can be honest with me.
d_ex_hotel_09_40,...
d_ex_hotel_09_41,It's a simple matter.
d_ex_hotel_09_42,"I assume various roles while carrying out assassinations, but having to don the guise of a Bunny Girl is something I haven't done before."
d_ex_hotel_09_43,"Therefore,"
d_ex_hotel_09_44,I want to collect more information on them.
d_ex_hotel_09_45,"From their mindset, down to how wearing the outfit affects their smallest behaviors, I want to know everything there is to..."
d_ex_hotel_09_46,All done!
d_ex_hotel_09_47,Alice suddenly appears standing in front of us.
d_ex_hotel_09_48,...!
d_ex_hotel_09_49,"Gee, you two are getting along like a house on fire."
d_ex_hotel_09_50,Er... right.
d_ex_hotel_09_51,We certainly are.
d_ex_hotel_09_52,"Sorry to keep you two waiting, but I brought a few things."
d_ex_hotel_09_53,Let me show you!
d_ex_hotel_09_54,Alice zooms in on the screen of the tablet she is holding.
d_ex_hotel_09_55,This is a conversation I had with Rabbity.
d_ex_hotel_09_56,Wait...
d_ex_hotel_09_57,...!
d_ex_hotel_09_58,Displayed on the screen is a conversation which I remember vividly.
d_ex_hotel_09_59,This is...
d_ex_hotel_09_60,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_09_61,And check this out! It's a doll that looks just like Rabbity.
d_ex_hotel_09_62,Isn't it the cutest?
d_ex_hotel_09_63,"With her arms outstretched, Alice shows us a doll."
d_ex_hotel_09_64,"Oh my, it really is precious."
d_ex_hotel_09_65,"It was tough trying to find one, but I really wanted to show it to you."
d_ex_hotel_09_66,That doll...
d_ex_hotel_09_67,Do you have other things to show me?
d_ex_hotel_09_68,I sure do! This is a photo I took with Rabbity.
d_ex_hotel_09_69,D and I look closely at the photo.
d_ex_hotel_09_70,"In it, Alice and I are standing side by side."
d_ex_hotel_09_71,...
d_ex_hotel_09_72,"Yep,"
d_ex_hotel_09_73,that's me alright.
d_ex_hotel_09_74,It sure is.
d_ex_hotel_09_75,"You asked for information about Rabbity,"
d_ex_hotel_09_76,so here it is!
d_ex_hotel_09_77,D goes quiet for a moment as she formulates her thoughts.
d_ex_hotel_09_78,"Um, Alice..."
d_ex_hotel_09_79,"I like spending time with Rabbity as much as the next person, but I was more curious about you."
d_ex_hotel_09_80,Me?
d_ex_hotel_09_81,That's right.
d_ex_hotel_09_82,"You're a big fan of that bunny outfit you're wearing, right?"
d_ex_hotel_09_83,I'm curious as to how wearing it makes you feel.
d_ex_hotel_09_84,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_09_85,"Well, when I walk around in this outfit,"
d_ex_hotel_09_86,"it softens my steps, so I can run faster and farther."
d_ex_hotel_09_87,"Plus, everyone smiles whenever they see me."
d_ex_hotel_09_88,"Seeing everyone become happy because of me makes me feel happy too, hehe."
d_ex_hotel_09_89,"Even now, I feel good just thinking about it."
d_ex_hotel_09_90,Can you tell me more?
d_ex_hotel_09_91,Alice continues expounding upon her thoughts as if she were in a reverie.
d_ex_hotel_09_92,"Goodbye, then!"
d_ex_hotel_09_93,"Thanks for coming with me, Rabbity."
d_ex_hotel_09_94,Sure thing. I'll see you around.
d_ex_hotel_09_95,It was nice meeting you both. See you around next time.
d_ex_hotel_09_96,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_09_97,Alice walks out smiling from ear to ear.
d_ex_hotel_09_98,Is this kind of information really of any help to you?
d_ex_hotel_09_99,"It wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was absolutely helpful."
d_ex_hotel_09_100,"Alice has an innocence wholly her own, which you can't find anywhere else."
d_ex_hotel_09_101,She'll make a fantastic reference for future scenarios.
d_ex_hotel_09_102,That's good.
d_ex_hotel_09_103,"Now, if you'll excuse me."
d_ex_hotel_09_104,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_09_105,"D also takes her leave, and silence descends upon the Hotel once again."
d_ex_armory_08_title,Feisty Gun Gal Bunny
d_ex_armory_08_1,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_08_2,Alice and I stop by the Armory during a jaunt around the Outpost.
d_ex_armory_08_3,"Wow,"
d_ex_armory_08_4,check out all these weapons!
d_ex_armory_08_5,Do you think they might have any carrot-shaped guns in here fit for a rabbit?
d_ex_armory_08_6,Why don't we have a look?
d_ex_armory_08_7,...
d_ex_armory_08_8,What are you doing here?
d_ex_armory_08_9,"Hi, Eunhwa."
d_ex_armory_08_10,Alice and I were taking a walk around the Outpost to show off her new outfit.
d_ex_armory_08_11,"You're from Unlimited, right?"
d_ex_armory_08_12,Do you usually dress like that?
d_ex_armory_08_13,"Howdy, Gun Gal."
d_ex_armory_08_14,... What did you call me?
d_ex_armory_08_15,Er... Alice was just saying how she wanted to see if you have any equipment meant for rabbits.
d_ex_armory_08_16,That's right! I'm a rabbit now.
d_ex_armory_08_17,Look! I even have big ears!
d_ex_armory_08_18,What do you think? Can we take a look around here?
d_ex_armory_08_19,...
d_ex_armory_08_20,We don't have anything like that.
d_ex_armory_08_21,Why do you always barge in here spouting nonsense?
d_ex_armory_08_22,*Sob*
d_ex_armory_08_23,"You don't hate me, do you?"
d_ex_armory_08_24,Why are you being so mean to Alice?
d_ex_armory_08_25,...
d_ex_armory_08_26,Get lost.
d_ex_armory_08_27,I can feel myself losing brain cells just being around you two morons.
d_ex_armory_08_28,Don't be so harsh.
d_ex_armory_08_29,You're the foremost authority on weapons. Can't you let Alice take a little peek?
d_ex_armory_08_30,"Yeah, Rabbity was telling me"
d_ex_armory_08_31,how you know everything about firearms!
d_ex_armory_08_32,*Sigh*
d_ex_armory_08_33,"Fine, I give up. I'm tired of bickering with you."
d_ex_armory_08_34,"Here, this way. What did you say you wanted to see, again?"
d_ex_armory_08_35,Eunhwa and Alice head further inside the Armory.
d_ex_armory_08_36,Eunhwa and Alice come back.
d_ex_armory_08_37,That was great!
d_ex_armory_08_38,What a fascinating place.
d_ex_armory_08_39,I didn't even realize how much time we spent in there.
d_ex_armory_08_40,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_08_41,Being a member of Unlimited means she's not completely ignorant about the military.
d_ex_armory_08_42,She actually kind of knows her stuff.
d_ex_armory_08_43,"It's all thanks to you for taking the time to explain stuff to me, Gun Gal."
d_ex_armory_08_44,I told you not to call me that.
d_ex_armory_08_45,"You see, Alice? I told you Eunhwa is friendly."
d_ex_armory_08_46,She sure is! She's such a nice person.
d_ex_armory_08_47,...
d_ex_armory_08_48,"Why are you dressed like that,"
d_ex_armory_08_49,anyway?
d_ex_armory_08_50,"Rabbity said that if I dress like this, it'll bring me good luck."
d_ex_armory_08_51,...
d_ex_armory_08_52,A poor excuse for him to indulge in his own fantasies.
d_ex_armory_08_53,You've got it all wrong. She's wearing that for an event at Coin Rush.
d_ex_armory_08_54,... If you say so.
d_ex_armory_08_55,So you think throwing some rabbit ears on her is going to make her as lucky as the 777 sisters?
d_ex_armory_08_56,That's the plan.
d_ex_armory_08_57,Yep! And I really like this outfit!
d_ex_armory_08_58,"Don't you like it, Eunhwa?"
d_ex_armory_08_59,Typical Weakling behavior.
d_ex_armory_08_60,Leaving everything to luck instead of your own grit and determination.
d_ex_armory_08_61,"Unlimited operates on the surface, where the smallest misstep can cost you your life."
d_ex_armory_08_62,You should know that better than damn near anyone.
d_ex_armory_08_63,"Dressing her in this ridiculous get-up is beyond the pale, even for a dunce like you."
d_ex_armory_08_64,"The lighter the clothes, the higher the defense."
d_ex_armory_08_65,That's right!
d_ex_armory_08_66,You say these things without any facts to back them up.
d_ex_armory_08_67,Alice.
d_ex_armory_08_68,Yes?
d_ex_armory_08_69,"Eunhwa seems rather interested in your outfit,"
d_ex_armory_08_70,so she must be curious about trying on a bunny outfit herself.
d_ex_armory_08_71,!!!
d_ex_armory_08_72,Don't you think?
d_ex_armory_08_73,I knew it!
d_ex_armory_08_74,?
d_ex_armory_08_75,I knew you wanted to become a bunny girl too!
d_ex_armory_08_76,I think a Gun Gal Bunny would be rather adorable.
d_ex_armory_08_77,You're totally right!
d_ex_armory_08_78,I think it'd suit her perfectly.
d_ex_armory_08_79,Ah!
d_ex_armory_08_80,Boss told me recently that he's got plenty of spare outfits lying around.
d_ex_armory_08_81,I'll bring you one sometime!
d_ex_armory_08_82,Sounds great.
d_ex_armory_08_83,Wait a minute...
d_ex_armory_08_84,I'll stay here and wait with Eunhwa.
d_ex_armory_08_85,"Okay, I'll be right back!"
d_ex_armory_08_86,See you in a bit.
d_ex_armory_08_87,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_08_88,Alice rushes off.
d_ex_armory_08_89,...
d_ex_armory_08_90,Weakling.
d_ex_armory_08_91,Go and stop her.
d_ex_armory_08_92,Stop her...?
d_ex_armory_08_93,"I've been patient with you today,"
d_ex_armory_08_94,but you're overstepping your bounds.
d_ex_armory_08_95,Even my patience has its limits.
d_ex_armory_08_96,"If you value your life, then I suggest you go and stop her. Quickly."
d_ex_armory_08_97,"If she comes back here and starts causing trouble, I'll have you hang from the Armory gate."
d_ex_armory_08_98,... I better go and stop Alice right away.
d_ex_gym_07_title,Rabbit and Lion
d_ex_gym_07_1,This is the place.
d_ex_gym_07_2,Do you think it's okay?
d_ex_gym_07_3,"Wow, it's huge!"
d_ex_gym_07_4,"If I practice running here in this outfit,"
d_ex_gym_07_5,I might end up really becoming a rabbit!
d_ex_gym_07_6,The path to being a true bunny is a long and arduous one.
d_ex_gym_07_7,"How come the door is locked, though?"
d_ex_gym_07_8,*Grrrrrrrrrrr*!
d_ex_gym_07_9,Rabbity!
d_ex_gym_07_10,What's a lion doing here?!
d_ex_gym_07_11,Timi?
d_ex_gym_07_12,Huh?
d_ex_gym_07_13,It's Zoo Keeper and Alice?
d_ex_gym_07_14,What are you two doing here?
d_ex_gym_07_15,How'd you get in here anyway? I thought I locked the door.
d_ex_gym_07_16,"We wanted to use the gym, so I used the master key."
d_ex_gym_07_17,"Hello, Lion Lady."
d_ex_gym_07_18,Oh my goodness!
d_ex_gym_07_19,"You're all dressed up, Alice."
d_ex_gym_07_20,"Hehe, yep!"
d_ex_gym_07_21,I came here today to become a real rabbit.
d_ex_gym_07_22,Come again?
d_ex_gym_07_23,Alice wants to practice running like a real rabbit does.
d_ex_gym_07_24,Could we use the gym today?
d_ex_gym_07_25,"Oh boy, what a pickle."
d_ex_gym_07_26,"Today is the day Timi exercises, so I booked the gym for the entire day."
d_ex_gym_07_27,"We don't mind if you two join us,"
d_ex_gym_07_28,but a lot of people get scared of Timi.
d_ex_gym_07_29,Timi doesn't exercise at the shelter?
d_ex_gym_07_30,This week is for the smaller animals to exercise.
d_ex_gym_07_31,"Timi needs to exercise daily, but he's scared stiff of the other animals."
d_ex_gym_07_32,"On the other hand, if I were to put off his exercise, I feel that would make him really stressed."
d_ex_gym_07_33,"So, every once in a while, I book the gym to get a workout in."
d_ex_gym_07_34,I see. I didn't know.
d_ex_gym_07_35,"It's okay, I'm not scared of Mr. Lion."
d_ex_gym_07_36,"Besides, I'm a rabbit now, so I'm sure we'll have plenty of fun together!"
d_ex_gym_07_37,You see?
d_ex_gym_07_38,"Do you wanna play with me today, Mr. Lion?"
d_ex_gym_07_39,Alice starts towards Timi.
d_ex_gym_07_40,*Grrrr*?
d_ex_gym_07_41,*Grr*
d_ex_gym_07_42,*Whimper*
d_ex_gym_07_43,Timi cowers behind Leona.
d_ex_gym_07_44,Huh? What's wrong?
d_ex_gym_07_45,Uh?
d_ex_gym_07_46,"What's wrong, Timi?"
d_ex_gym_07_47,*Whimper*
d_ex_gym_07_48,He says he thinks you're scary.
d_ex_gym_07_49,I think he sees you as a small animal.
d_ex_gym_07_50,I certainly didn't expect this...
d_ex_gym_07_51,"Aww, but I wanna be friends with him..."
d_ex_gym_07_52,What should I do?
d_ex_gym_07_53,Hmm...
d_ex_gym_07_54,"Because of his size, Timi always has a hard time finding people to play tag with."
d_ex_gym_07_55,Would you be up for that?
d_ex_gym_07_56,Of course!
d_ex_gym_07_57,"Come on, Mr. Lion, let's play tag together!"
d_ex_gym_07_58,??
d_ex_gym_07_59,Come and catch me!
d_ex_gym_07_60,Hippity hop!
d_ex_gym_07_61,"Alice grabs Timi's front paws for a moment, then takes off running."
d_ex_gym_07_62,*Grrrr*!
d_ex_gym_07_63,"Come on, Mr. Lion! Try and catch me!"
d_ex_gym_07_64,*Roooooar*
d_ex_gym_07_65,...
d_ex_gym_07_66,Timi's roar sounds more like a howl.
d_ex_gym_07_67,It should be okay... right?
d_ex_gym_07_68,I think so...
d_ex_gym_07_69,"After a bit of time passes, Timi eventually stops whining,"
d_ex_gym_07_70,"and in no time at all, he and Alice are joyfully prancing about."
d_ex_gym_07_71,You're so fast!
d_ex_gym_07_72,"Rabbity,"
d_ex_gym_07_73,come and join us!
d_ex_gym_07_74,Should I?
d_ex_gym_07_75,"Okay, try and catch me, Timi."
d_ex_gym_07_76,"I take off sprinting as fast as I can, but..."
d_ex_gym_07_77,*Grrr*!
d_ex_gym_07_78,Agh!
d_ex_gym_07_79,Timi pounces on me as soon as I begin.
d_ex_gym_07_80,"Hahaha! Did you really just try to outrun Timi, Zoo Keeper?"
d_ex_gym_07_81,"Emphasis on ""try""."
d_ex_gym_07_82,My turn!
d_ex_gym_07_83,"Alice takes off like the wind,"
d_ex_gym_07_84,frolicking along excitedly with Timi.
d_ex_gym_07_85,Rabbits sure are fast...
d_ex_gym_07_86,"Come on, Mr. Lion, faster!"
d_ex_gym_07_87,*Grrrrrr*!
d_ex_gym_07_88,They both seem to have boundless energy.
d_ex_gym_07_89,"Here, come sit beside me, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_gym_07_90,"Thanks to Alice, I think I'll have some spare time to rest."
d_ex_gym_07_91,I suppose you're usually the one doing the running?
d_ex_gym_07_92,Yeah.
d_ex_gym_07_93,"It's not really my thing, though. I prefer using the treadmill or playing frisbee instead."
d_ex_gym_07_94,Sounds like the members of Happy Zoo are a tough bunch.
d_ex_gym_07_95,I'm really happy seeing someone who absolutely adores animals.
d_ex_gym_07_96,It makes me feel like our efforts aren't in vain.
d_ex_gym_07_97,"Before we know it, night has descended."
d_ex_gym_07_98,"Thanks for coming today, Zoo Keeper."
d_ex_gym_07_99,Don't mention it. I barely did anything.
d_ex_gym_07_100,"You too, Alice. Thank you."
d_ex_gym_07_101,Zzzzz...
d_ex_gym_07_102,Grrrr...
d_ex_gym_07_103,"Alice and Timi are both collapsed in a pile, leaning against each other, sound asleep."
d_ex_gym_07_104,Looks like their fatigue caught up with them once they stopped moving.
d_ex_gym_07_105,They're both out like a light.
d_ex_gym_07_106,Not surprising considering they've been running all day.
d_ex_gym_07_107,H-huh...? Rabbity?
d_ex_gym_07_108,Did you sleep well?
d_ex_gym_07_109,Yeah...
d_ex_gym_07_110,*Yawn*
d_ex_gym_07_111,"I wanted to thank you for coming today, Alice."
d_ex_gym_07_112,It's been a long time since I've seen Timi so excited.
d_ex_gym_07_113,"If you can, we'd love to have you come around again to play with him."
d_ex_gym_07_114,"Could I, really?"
d_ex_gym_07_115,That'd be great!
d_ex_gym_07_116,I'd love to play more with Mr. Lion!
d_ex_gym_07_117,Sounds like a plan.
d_ex_gym_07_118,Yahoo!
d_ex_gym_07_119,"With that, the lion and rabbit's playdate comes to an end."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_title,Bunny For You ♡
d_ex_maidcafe_09_1,*Ring*
d_ex_maidcafe_09_2,"Blanc, Noir, and I have been invited to the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_3,"We've come to taste some of the new menu items, and as thanks for our effort,"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_4,Soda plans on creating a few unique dishes especially for Blanc and Noir.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_5,Wowzer!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_6,Wow...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_7,The cafe is festooned with bunny girl-related decorations.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_8,"Hey, guys!"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_9,How nice of you to come!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_10,"We heard you'd prepared a special menu just for us, so how could we not come?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_11,"Isn't that right, Noir?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_12,"Y-yeah! I love your outfit, Soda. It's so pretty."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_13,"Oh my gosh, thanks!"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_14,"What an honor to be praised by real, genuine bunny girls."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_15,"Come now, there's no such thing as real or fake when it comes to bunny girls."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_16,"From where I'm standing, you look like a proper bunny girl through and through."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_17,"Hehe, thank you."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_18,"Here, let me show you to your seat. Wait right here, and I'll be back."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_19,Soda darts into the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_20,An entire menu inspired by us... I can hardly believe it.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_21,"I'm so pumped for this! What about you, Noir?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_22,"I'm really excited as well. And you, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_23,I'm looking forward to it too.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_24,"Thank you for waiting. First up, we have some Bunny Omurice for you."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_25,Enjoy.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_26,Let's dig in.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_27,"Thanks, Soda."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_28,We each take a scoop of our omurice and sample it eagerly.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_29,Wow! It's delicious!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_30,"Yeah! The ketchup is really sweet, I like it."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_31,"Really? I thought it was a bit spicy, actually."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_32,"What do you think of the taste, Pit Boss?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_33,I think it's leaning towards sweet.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_34,I think it's leaning towards spicy.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_35,Really? Is my taste sensor broken?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_36,Oh... m-maybe I made a mistake.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_37,There's no way you both could be wrong...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_38,"Since today's menu is centered around Blanc and Noir,"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_39,I made two variations for each dish.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_40,"I can't believe you went to such lengths for us, Soda."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_41,I'm so touched...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_42,"Sauces can be similar in many ways, but also distinctly unique. Just like Blanc and Noir."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_43,That's precisely what I was going for!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_44,"Here, let me show you one more thing."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_45,This is a Bunny Parfait! I made this in two variations.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_46,Soda brings out a parfait in an opulent glass.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_47,"The right side is chocolate flavored, representing Noir, and the left is cream flavored for Blanc."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_48,It looks absolutely gorgeous!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_49,How interesting.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_50,"All three of us dig into our parfaits, and before we know it, we've nearly polished them off."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_51,"So, what did you think?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_52,I really enjoyed it.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_53,Delicious. Blanc?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_54,Hmm... there was one thing that bothered me.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_55,Oh?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_56,What's that?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_57,Aren't you supposed to be a bunny girl right now?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_58,Yes... why?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_59,"You crafted these incredible dishes for us, but left yourself out. I wish there was something prepared for you, Soda."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_60,I agree.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_61,You're always thinking of others and neglecting yourself.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_62,"This time, you deserve to share the spotlight with us."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_63,Every individual bunny girl should shine as bright as the next.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_64,I... I never thought about that before.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_65,So what should I do?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_66,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_67,How about adding a flavor to the parfait that represents Soda?
d_ex_maidcafe_09_68,"A fine idea, Pit Boss. I'm sure we can come up with something between all of us."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_69,I'm sure we can!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_70,"All of us get to work brainstorming a new modified parfait,"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_71,"and we end up with one consisting of chocolate, cream, and melon."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_72,Phew... all done.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_73,"Thanks for the help, Pit Boss. We couldn't have done it without you."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_74,Don't mention it.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_75,"I presume this parfait is meant for three people, yes?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_76,A dish made just for me...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_77,I've never felt this way before.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_78,It's always bothered me seeing your hard work go unrecognized.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_79,Right! We want you to be happy too.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_80,"Oh my gosh, you guys... you're gonna make me cry."
d_ex_maidcafe_09_81,"So long as you're happy, we're happy. Isn't that right, Noir?"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_82,That's right! What a wonderful feeling this is.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_83,"Well, Noir and I have to be on our way,"
d_ex_maidcafe_09_84,so we'll catch you two later.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_85,Goodbye!
d_ex_maidcafe_09_86,Bye! Thanks for stopping by.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_87,Blanc and Noir wave goodbye as they leave the café.
d_ex_maidcafe_09_88,Hehe... so this is for me...
d_ex_maidcafe_09_89,"Soda stares at the parfait made specially for her, lost in thought."
d_ex_modernbar_08_title,The Rabbit Bartender's Bitter Concoction
d_ex_modernbar_08_01,*Ring*
d_ex_modernbar_08_02,"With some free time, I stop by the bar to enjoy a drink."
d_ex_modernbar_08_03,It's not fair!
d_ex_modernbar_08_04,I hear a commotion inside the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_08_05,I'm in my third year! Why can't I drink?
d_ex_modernbar_08_06,Rei? What are you doing here?
d_ex_modernbar_08_07,"Huh? Oh, hey Teacher."
d_ex_modernbar_08_08,"I keep telling these guys that I'm a junior, but they're saying I can't be in here without a guardian!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_09,What do you want to go inside for?
d_ex_modernbar_08_10,I heard there's a special rabbit bartender coming today who can make anything.
d_ex_modernbar_08_11,Could you come in with me just this once?
d_ex_modernbar_08_12,"Okay, let's go."
d_ex_modernbar_08_13,"Woohoo, thanks Teacher!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_14,I grab Rei's hand and we enter the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_08_15,"Hey, Master."
d_ex_modernbar_08_16,"Are you the ""rabbit bartender"" everyone's talking about?"
d_ex_modernbar_08_17,"Hehe, I sure am. I decided to dress up in my bunny outfit and be a bartender for a day."
d_ex_modernbar_08_18,"In that case, could I have a cocktail?"
d_ex_modernbar_08_19,"Sure, coming right up!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_20,"Oh my gosh, it's really her! She's here!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_21,A-ahem!
d_ex_modernbar_08_22,C-could I have one drink as well?
d_ex_modernbar_08_23,"Oh, hi Rei!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_24,"Wow, a genuine rabbit bartender..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_25,"Hehe, how do I look? Do I look good?"
d_ex_modernbar_08_26,You bet!
d_ex_modernbar_08_27,It was definitely worth coming all the way down here.
d_ex_modernbar_08_28,"Ahem, I mean..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_29,"This is your first time here, isn't it, Teacher? Here, allow me."
d_ex_modernbar_08_30,"I'll have the usual, bartender, and make it a stiff one. Stronger and more bitter than Teacher's."
d_ex_modernbar_08_31,Sure thing.
d_ex_modernbar_08_32,"Soda... You know you can't give her alcohol, right?"
d_ex_modernbar_08_33,"Hehe, of course."
d_ex_modernbar_08_34,Don't forget that I'm a professional maid. I'm prepared for situations like this.
d_ex_modernbar_08_35,Soda begins to mix the drinks.
d_ex_modernbar_08_36,*Swish*
d_ex_modernbar_08_37,"Here's a special concoction I prepared just for you, Rei."
d_ex_modernbar_08_38,It appears... to be a regular glass of orange juice.
d_ex_modernbar_08_39,It's even decorated with little rabbit ears!
d_ex_modernbar_08_40,So cute!
d_ex_modernbar_08_41,Rabbit-themed Orange Juice made by a rabbit bartender. It doesn't get any better than this.
d_ex_modernbar_08_42,Rei always has had a soft spot for cute things.
d_ex_modernbar_08_43,"It only makes sense, since she's so cute herself."
d_ex_modernbar_08_44,"No way, you two are reading me totally wrong."
d_ex_modernbar_08_45,I'm a junior now. I'm too old to be fangirling about cute things. That's why I'm drinking something even stiffer than what Teacher is having.
d_ex_modernbar_08_46,"If you say so. Anyway, enjoy it."
d_ex_modernbar_08_47,Bottoms up!
d_ex_modernbar_08_48,*Sip*
d_ex_modernbar_08_49,How's the taste?
d_ex_modernbar_08_50,Blech...
d_ex_modernbar_08_51,Blech?
d_ex_modernbar_08_52,Ugh!
d_ex_modernbar_08_53,*Sniff*
d_ex_modernbar_08_54,??
d_ex_modernbar_08_55,Urgh...
d_ex_modernbar_08_56,R-Rei? Are you okay?
d_ex_modernbar_08_57,It's... so bitter...
d_ex_modernbar_08_58,Too bitter.
d_ex_modernbar_08_59,But... you specifically mentioned you wanted something bitter. That's why I incorporated orange peels into it.
d_ex_modernbar_08_60,Ugh... I didn't know you had it out for me.
d_ex_modernbar_08_61,Hey! That's not what's going on here!
d_ex_modernbar_08_62,"I came all the way out here to see you, and this is what you do to me?"
d_ex_modernbar_08_63,"J-just a moment, I'll make you another..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_64,*Slip*
d_ex_modernbar_08_65,Whaaa!
d_ex_modernbar_08_66,"Soda hastily moves to grab Rei's juice, and in the process..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_67,*Craaaash*
d_ex_modernbar_08_68,accidentally tips the glass over and spills it all over Rei's face.
d_ex_modernbar_08_69,Ahhhhhhhh!
d_ex_modernbar_08_70,Teacher!
d_ex_modernbar_08_71,"I'm so sorry! Here, let me wipe it off..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_72,...
d_ex_modernbar_08_73,The situation is quickly falling apart.
d_ex_modernbar_08_74,"Soda, you calm Rei down. I'll clean up the floor."
d_ex_modernbar_08_75,Of-of course! Wait just a moment!
d_ex_modernbar_08_76,*Wipe wipe*
d_ex_modernbar_08_77,I bend down and wipe the juice off the floor.
d_ex_modernbar_08_78,Uhuuuuuuu...
d_ex_modernbar_08_79,H... hehe...
d_ex_modernbar_08_80,Hehe?
d_ex_modernbar_08_81,I look up from the floor to see Soda embracing Rei.
d_ex_modernbar_08_82,Hehe... the rabbit bartender is hugging me. So soft and fluffy...
d_ex_modernbar_08_83,"I've cleaned up your face, but your clothes are all wet..."
d_ex_modernbar_08_84,Is it okay if I wash them for you?
d_ex_modernbar_08_85,It's okay.
d_ex_modernbar_08_86,Someone in their third year like me can brush this stuff off with no problem.
d_ex_modernbar_08_87,Really? That's awfully mature of you.
d_ex_modernbar_08_88,Naturally.
d_ex_modernbar_08_89,I even received a pat on my head and a compliment...
d_ex_modernbar_08_90,"I'm gonna go and brag about it to Ein and Zwei, hehehe!"
d_ex_modernbar_08_91,I'm really sorry about all this.
d_ex_modernbar_08_92,*Hug*
d_ex_modernbar_08_93,!!!
d_ex_modernbar_08_94,Soda hugs Rei even tighter.
d_ex_modernbar_08_95,"A flustered Soda and Rei, who's thoroughly soaked but over the moon. What a sight to behold."
d_ex_modernbar_08_96,Hehehehehe.
d_ex_modernbar_08_97,"As long as Rei is happy, I suppose that's all that matters."
d_ex_police_09_title,Bunny Girl the Culprit?
d_ex_police_09_1,"On a quiet afternoon, I'm on a peaceful stroll through the Outpost,"
d_ex_police_09_2,when I run into Soda who is holding a bunch of envelopes in her hand and looking lost.
d_ex_police_09_3,"What are you up to, Soda?"
d_ex_police_09_4,H-huh? Master?
d_ex_police_09_5,"Coin Rush and the Maid Cafe are doing a crossover promotion, and we've been giving out free bunny cookies for the past week."
d_ex_police_09_6,That's why I'm wearing this outfit.
d_ex_police_09_7,"Working as hard as ever, I see."
d_ex_police_09_8,"Hehe, you know it. I brought the cookies,"
d_ex_police_09_9,"but I feel a bit awkward approaching people, so I'm not sure where to start."
d_ex_police_09_10,Would you like me to help you?
d_ex_police_09_11,W-would that be okay?
d_ex_police_09_12,"Sure, it's no problem. Let's get going."
d_ex_police_09_13,How about we start at the Police Station?
d_ex_police_09_14,Sure! Sounds good.
d_ex_police_09_15,*Zing*
d_ex_police_09_16,"Hello, everyone!"
d_ex_police_09_17,"We came to hand out some delicious bunny cookies, courtesy of the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_police_09_18,"As we head into the Police Station, we're greeted with dead silence."
d_ex_police_09_19,Huh?
d_ex_police_09_20,There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
d_ex_police_09_21,Looks like you're right.
d_ex_police_09_22,I really wanted to deliver these cookies personally...
d_ex_police_09_23,"Even if you don't hand them over yourself, they'll appreciate the gesture. I'll be sure to tell them."
d_ex_police_09_24,"Okay, thanks, Master."
d_ex_police_09_25,I'll just set them on the front desk then.
d_ex_police_09_26,*Thud*
d_ex_police_09_27,Soda places a rabbit-shaped envelope on the desk.
d_ex_police_09_28,"Alright, let's move onto the next location..."
d_ex_police_09_29,*Zing*
d_ex_police_09_30,"Oh, hey you two!"
d_ex_police_09_31,"Is that you, Commander? Hey!"
d_ex_police_09_32,What are you doing running around with a giant rabbit?
d_ex_police_09_33,"Hey Miranda, hey Quiry."
d_ex_police_09_34,Howdy!
d_ex_police_09_35,...!
d_ex_police_09_36,What were you two up to?
d_ex_police_09_37,We received a report and we're searching for the culprit.
d_ex_police_09_38,"We almost apprehended a suspect, but they got away. And we were scolded by Poli."
d_ex_police_09_39,"Don't be too disheartened, Miranda."
d_ex_police_09_40,We appreciate how hard you work to keep us safe.
d_ex_police_09_41,"You'll get another chance, I'm sure of..."
d_ex_police_09_42,"You're right, and that chance is right now."
d_ex_police_09_43,Huh?
d_ex_police_09_44,I knew it! My suspicions turned out to be correct.
d_ex_police_09_45,That's right!
d_ex_police_09_46,The culprit was described as wearing a bunny outfit and causing a ruckus. It's none other than Soda!
d_ex_police_09_47,What?!
d_ex_police_09_48,There must be some kind of misunderstanding. Soda was simply giving out cookies...
d_ex_police_09_49,I don't want to hear your excuses!
d_ex_police_09_50,You attempted to hide in the Police Station to avoid any suspicion.
d_ex_police_09_51,"Soda, you're under arrest for creating a public disturbance."
d_ex_police_09_52,What's going on?!
d_ex_police_09_53,We can't let her get away like last time. Quiry!
d_ex_police_09_54,On it!
d_ex_police_09_55,*Jump*
d_ex_police_09_56,*Crash*
d_ex_police_09_57,"Quiry leaps haphazardly towards the desk where the rabbit-shaped envelope is placed, banging her head on it in the process."
d_ex_police_09_58,"Stay right where you are, Soda!"
d_ex_police_09_59,*Crash*
d_ex_police_09_60,Gah!
d_ex_police_09_61,...
d_ex_police_09_62,Miranda and Soda are running around the Police Station in a frenzy.
d_ex_police_09_63,"Miranda, I'm innocent!"
d_ex_police_09_64,Save your defense for your trial!
d_ex_police_09_65,You got away last time by feeding us the same line!
d_ex_police_09_66,*Pow pow pow*
d_ex_police_09_67,Ow! Stop stepping on me!
d_ex_police_09_68,"Miranda and Soda are trampling on Quiry, who is collapsed on the ground nursing her head."
d_ex_police_09_69,"Master, help me!"
d_ex_police_09_70,We're not letting you slip past us this time! We're gonna make Poli proud!
d_ex_police_09_71,*Crash*
d_ex_police_09_72,"At this rate, there won't be anything in the Police Station left intact."
d_ex_police_09_73,"Everyone, calm down..."
d_ex_police_09_74,*Thud*
d_ex_police_09_75,Argh!
d_ex_police_09_76,?!
d_ex_police_09_77,*Crash*
d_ex_police_09_78,Soda trips over Quiry.
d_ex_police_09_79,Got you!
d_ex_police_09_80,All that's left to do is notify Poli.
d_ex_police_09_81,"You got it wrong, Miranda!"
d_ex_police_09_82,*Bzzzz*
d_ex_police_09_83,Hmm? Someone's calling me?
d_ex_police_09_84,This is Miranda. Who's this?
d_ex_police_09_85,"Who do you think? It's me, Poli."
d_ex_police_09_86,Poli! I have good news. I managed to apprehend the suspect!
d_ex_police_09_87,You did?
d_ex_police_09_88,She was shamelessly attempting to seek refuge in the Police Station after committing a serious offense.
d_ex_police_09_89,But... I just caught the culprit.
d_ex_police_09_90,Y-you what?
d_ex_police_09_91,Then... the person I just caught is... uh oh.
d_ex_police_09_92,"Grrrr... Miranda, did you just do something foolish again?"
d_ex_police_09_93,N-No! Not at all!
d_ex_police_09_94,Ugh... just wait there. I'll be there soon.
d_ex_police_09_95,"Soda, I... I think I owe you an apology."
d_ex_police_09_96,I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
d_ex_police_09_97,"It's okay, don't be too hard on yourself, Miranda. Everyone makes mistakes."
d_ex_police_09_98,Can... can you find it in yourself to forgive me?
d_ex_police_09_99,"Of course! I also make mistakes all the time, but I keep trying!"
d_ex_police_09_100,Soda is right. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is how you deal with it going forward.
d_ex_police_09_101,Exactly.
d_ex_police_09_102,Couldn't have said it better myself!
d_ex_police_09_103,"Now, why don't we clean this place up before Poli gets here?"
d_ex_police_09_104,!!
d_ex_police_09_105,Oh no! I didn't even notice! The Police Station is a mess.
d_ex_police_09_106,A burglar must have come in and ransacked the place while we were distracted.
d_ex_police_09_107,Huh? Who came in? I didn't see anything.
d_ex_police_09_108,You were the ones who did this...
d_ex_police_09_109,We're doomed. All we can do is wait to get chewed out by Poli again.
d_ex_police_09_110,"Don't worry, Miranda. Cleaning up is my specialty."
d_ex_police_09_111,"You'd do that for me? You're amazing, Soda!"
d_ex_police_09_112,Don't mention it! Just give me a few moments.
d_ex_police_09_113,La de dah♪
d_ex_police_09_114,"Soda brings over a barrage of different cleaning tools, humming all the while."
d_ex_police_09_115,"Be careful, Quiry is still lying on the floor."
d_ex_police_09_116,Huh? What did you say... wwhooooa!
d_ex_police_09_117,*Thud*
d_ex_police_09_118,Argh!
d_ex_police_09_119,*Crash*
d_ex_police_09_120,I'm going to have some explaining to do when Poli arrives.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_title,Golden-Haired Beauty
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_1,"Helloooo, my lovely Lupins!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_2,"Today, we're going to film some super special outdoor content!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_3,It's all about...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_4,finding the top blonde beauty in the Ark!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_5,What's that? You think I'm the prettiest blonde there is?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_6,"Hehe, I knew you all would say that, so I decided not to participate!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_7,"Alrighty, before we start the interview,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_8,let's give a big welcome to a returning guest!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_9,"It's none other than the shining star of the Ark, our very own Sweetie!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_10,"Don't listen to her, everyone. She's exaggerating."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_11,"Oh, come on now, Sweetie! You mustn't be too modest!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_12,"Great! Now that we've gotten introductions out of the way, let's get started with the interview."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_13,"Oh my goodness! Right off the bat, we've spotted an elegant blonde beauty!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_14,Hmm?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_15,"Hehe, you have a most discerning eye."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_16,"Oh god, not her..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_17,"The legendary city of gold, El Dorado; the topaz that sees through the truth."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_18,All of these are aliases used to refer to my luscious locks...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_19,Uh... interesting.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_20,"If we're looking for the best blonde in the Ark, perhaps we'll have to..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_21,Of course.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_22,Huh? What was that?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_23,"An honor as high as this could only be allotted to one person,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_24,"and therefore, paradoxically, I am terribly lonely."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_25,This lonely fate is something that ceaselessly eats away at me.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_26,... Hehe.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_27,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_28,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_29,"Um... could you show our viewers something endearing about you? A hidden talent, maybe?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_30,What?!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_31,You know about that?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_32,Are you a spy sent by the Big O?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_33,"Er, I'm not quite sure exactly what you mean by ""that""."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_34,"Ah, so you're simply an ordinary civilian."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_35,"In that case, I would suggest you forego prying into that matter any further,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_36,for it may lead you to ruin.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_37,"Got it! Well then, I better get going!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_38,W-wait!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_39,Yes?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_40,"While it is dangerous for me to use my hidden talent straight out,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_41,I could perhaps mimic the appearance of it.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_42,Oh? Are you saying you'll give us a sneak peek of some kind?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_43,"Yes, for your curiosity has awakened the Dragon."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_44,Revere and tremble in fear before this Stygian abyss!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_45,Dragon. of. the. Deep!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_46,Guillotine wildly flails her arms through the air.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_47,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_48,Arrrrrghhh!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_49,...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_50,Ah-hah! I knew it! Was my fusillade too potent for the saint?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_51,Um...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_52,What is it? Is it your first time seeing a forbidden technique?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_53,"You do realize I'm out to find the most beautiful blonde on the Ark, right?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_54,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_55,And...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_56,thousands of viewers are watching right now...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_57,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_58,Ahem...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_59,"W-wait, what's that? An emergency call from the Association?"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_60,I-I've got to take this. See you next time!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_61,Guillotine has barely gotten the words out before she vanishes.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_62,That was quite the... interview! Hehe...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_63,Let's see... Who should we talk to next?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_64,Hero interview!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_65,Laplace suddenly appears amidst a plume of dust.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_66,*Cough cough* You scared me!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_67,Laplace? What's going on?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_68,"A fine question indeed, Birdie!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_69,I was on patrol when I heard what seemed like someone calling out to me. So I rushed over here as fast as I could!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_70,"Actually, we're looking for the most beautiful blonde..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_71,Oh? You mean my hair color?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_72,"If you're ever in a pickle and spot these golden locks, you can rest assured"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_73,that help is on the way!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_74,"Your hair is quite gorgeous,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_75,"but we're looking for the best blonde beauty,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_76,not the best blonde hero!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_77,...!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_78,I... I see.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_79,What's that? I hear someone calling for me!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_80,"Hero, out!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_81,*Cough cough*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_82,Oh no... my blouse is covered in dust. This just came out too...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_83,"However, our search isn't over yet! We've gotta find the most amazing blonde beauty out there!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_84,Let's see...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_85,Look over there.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_86,Oh my goodness! What a gorgeous blonde!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_87,Hello! Do you mind if we have a quick interview?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_88,Excuse me?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_89,"Oh, hey Coach! So nice to see you!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_90,"Nice to see you, Clay."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_91,"If Coach is gonna stay for it, I'd love to do an interview!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_92,Great! Why don't you quickly introduce yourself?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_93,Hello!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_94,I'm in charge of showmanship in the cheerleading squad known as Rewind.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_95,My name's Clay.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_96,"Wow, such beautiful blonde hair you have!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_97,"Hehe, thanks!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_98,I'm currently looking for the most rapturous blonde beauty in the Ark.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_99,Would you like to participate?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_100,"Oh boy, when you phrase it that way, it makes me a bit embarrassed."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_101,"Still though, I'll participate."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_102,Great!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_103,Then what would you say is your most charming aspect?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_104,Charming?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_105,Hmm...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_106,My most charming aspect is...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_107,capturing the audience's attention
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_108,in an instant!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_109,Woooww!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_110,Could you perhaps show us
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_111,one of your show-stopping routines?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_112,Of course!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_113,Clay checks the camera and then enthusiastically launches into a cheerleading routine.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_114,*Clap clap clap*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_115,"Cheer up!
Power up!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_116,"All together now, one, two, three!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_117,*Crash*
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_118,Clay trips and falls to the ground but quickly gets up as if nothing happened.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_119,"Hehe, whoops. I fell."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_120,One more time to all those watching!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_121,Raise your hands above your head and shout:
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_122,We're unstoppable!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_123,We're unstoppable!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_124,"My goodness, I really got caught up in that!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_125,Huff huff...
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_126,"Looks like you did as well, Sweetie."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_127,"Did you feel that too, Lupins? What an incredible energy!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_128,The chat is filled with a ceaseless stream of impassioned cheers.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_129,"That was amazing, Clay!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_130,"Hehe, glad you liked it!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_131,"Sweetie, I think we might have found her."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_132,I think you're right.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_133,It looks like the viewers agree too.
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_134,"Well then, it's official! The best blonde beauty in the Ark is..."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_135,Clay!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_136,W-what?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_137,"With your sparkling blonde hair and even more dazzling cheerleading skills,"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_138,there's no doubt in our mind that you deserve to be number one!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_139,"Congratulations, Clay."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_140,Can you share a few words with us on how it feels to win?
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_141,"*Sob* Thank you so much, everyone!"
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_142,"I'm thrilled that you all enjoyed my routine, and I'm honored to receive such accolades."
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_143,Please show lots of love to Rewind!
d_ex_goddessofvictory_09_144,"The outburst of positive energy from Clay and Rupee continued throughout the day, making for an exciting time."
d_ex_shopping_08_title,Keep Shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_1,"On my way to the mall to restock on supplies for the Commander's Room,"
d_ex_shopping_08_2,I notice a commotion near the entrance.
d_ex_shopping_08_3,"As I get closer, I can hear music blaring and people cheering."
d_ex_shopping_08_4,"Hold on, is that..."
d_ex_shopping_08_5,*Boom boom boom boom*
d_ex_shopping_08_6,"C'mon, everyone, put your hands together!"
d_ex_shopping_08_7,V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! What's that spell? Victory!
d_ex_shopping_08_8,"Get yourself a discount and buy, buy, buy!"
d_ex_shopping_08_9,Keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_10,Keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_11,"As I get closer, I see Clay at the mall entrance, cheerleading with gusto."
d_ex_shopping_08_12,"A speaker nearby blasts the sounds of a cheering crowd, adding to the excitement."
d_ex_shopping_08_13,"Groceries on the left, go whooosh!"
d_ex_shopping_08_14,Whooosh!
d_ex_shopping_08_15,"Daily essentials on the right, go whooosh!"
d_ex_shopping_08_16,Whoooosh!
d_ex_shopping_08_17,"Clay is sweating profusely as she cheers, as if there were countless spectators watching."
d_ex_shopping_08_18,Clay?
d_ex_shopping_08_19,"Hi, Coach!"
d_ex_shopping_08_20,Are you here for some shopping?
d_ex_shopping_08_21,"Yeah,"
d_ex_shopping_08_22,but what are you up to?
d_ex_shopping_08_23,I'm practicing my routine for the Talentum Mall.
d_ex_shopping_08_24,"They're gonna have a mega sale event, so I've gotta prepare something awesome!"
d_ex_shopping_08_25,I see.
d_ex_shopping_08_26,"How about you, Coach?"
d_ex_shopping_08_27,What are you looking to buy?
d_ex_shopping_08_28,Just some office supplies and carbonated water.
d_ex_shopping_08_29,"If that's the case,"
d_ex_shopping_08_30,I recommend starting on the right side!
d_ex_shopping_08_31,You've gotta keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_32,Keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_33,"Everyone on the right, gimme a whoosh!"
d_ex_shopping_08_34,Whoooosh!
d_ex_shopping_08_35,"Afterward, as I push my shopping cart through the aisles, I realize I've ended up buying more than I intended."
d_ex_shopping_08_36,"Hey there, Rookie. It's been a while."
d_ex_shopping_08_37,That's quite a haul you've got there. I appreciate your business.
d_ex_shopping_08_38,"Hey, Yan."
d_ex_shopping_08_39,Can I ask what's the deal with Clay?
d_ex_shopping_08_40,What do you mean?
d_ex_shopping_08_41,"At the mall entrance, Clay continues to throw herself into her routine."
d_ex_shopping_08_42,"Ah, you mean our hype woman?"
d_ex_shopping_08_43,Hype woman?
d_ex_shopping_08_44,That's right.
d_ex_shopping_08_45,"I'm sure you've heard we're gearing up for a mega sale, haven't you?"
d_ex_shopping_08_46,I have.
d_ex_shopping_08_47,"I'm not sure if it was 'cause of the promotion not being up to par,"
d_ex_shopping_08_48,but the customer turnout ain't been all that great.
d_ex_shopping_08_49,"Then, I just so happened to bump into that girl out there, who I'd seen on TV before."
d_ex_shopping_08_50,"I thought she'd be perfect for drumming up business, so I asked her if she wanted to work for me."
d_ex_shopping_08_51,"You're not making her do this for free, are you?"
d_ex_shopping_08_52,Of course not.
d_ex_shopping_08_53,I'm not running some corner shop in a small village.
d_ex_shopping_08_54,"She signed the contract, fair and square."
d_ex_shopping_08_55,"If she cheers and takes photos in front of the shopping mall today,"
d_ex_shopping_08_56,I'm set to hook her up with some new outfits and a year's worth of ion supply drinks.
d_ex_shopping_08_57,An entire year?!
d_ex_shopping_08_58,"You sound tempted, Rookie. Want to join?"
d_ex_shopping_08_59,"If you start now, I can't guarantee you any clothes,"
d_ex_shopping_08_60,but a half-year's supply of soda could certainly be arranged.
d_ex_shopping_08_61,Perhaps a half-year's supply of soda could really improve my financial situation...
d_ex_shopping_08_62,"All right, I'll do it."
d_ex_shopping_08_63,A wise decision.
d_ex_shopping_08_64,"All right then, sign right here. Then get out there and start practicing with her."
d_ex_shopping_08_65,I sign the contract Yan gave me and stand next to Clay.
d_ex_shopping_08_66,"Oh my gosh, Coach! Are you joining in too?"
d_ex_shopping_08_67,"Yeah, seems like it."
d_ex_shopping_08_68,That's fantastic! Let's give this cheer everything we've got!
d_ex_shopping_08_69,"C'mon, everyone, grab your carts!"
d_ex_shopping_08_70,Grab them!
d_ex_shopping_08_71,Raise your heads and shout to the sky!
d_ex_shopping_08_72,Shout to the sky!
d_ex_shopping_08_73,Keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_74,Keep shopping!
d_ex_shopping_08_75,Woohooo!
d_ex_shopping_08_76,I continue practicing with Clay until the sun begins to set.
d_ex_shopping_08_77,"Meanwhile, a record number of shoppers come to Talentum Mall for their sales event."
d_ex_theater_09_title,"Clay, Rewind!"
d_ex_theater_09_1,Today is dedicated to preparing for Volume's upcoming concert.
d_ex_theater_09_2,"Manager, are they the ones you mentioned before?"
d_ex_theater_09_3,"Rewind, was it?"
d_ex_theater_09_4,That's right.
d_ex_theater_09_5,"Bay, Clay, this is Volume."
d_ex_theater_09_6,Nice to meet you.
d_ex_theater_09_7,"I'm Bay, the leader of Rewind."
d_ex_theater_09_8,And I'm Clay!
d_ex_theater_09_9,"You probably already know, but I'm Volume."
d_ex_theater_09_10,Volume and Bay exchange a light handshake.
d_ex_theater_09_11,"Okay. Before we start practicing, let me give you a quick rundown."
d_ex_theater_09_12,You two are going to be my opening act.
d_ex_theater_09_13,Your job is to fire up the crowd with a killer cheerleading routine.
d_ex_theater_09_14,And then...
d_ex_theater_09_15,BAMMM!!
d_ex_theater_09_16,Gah!
d_ex_theater_09_17,That's when I make my grand entrance.
d_ex_theater_09_18,Doesn't that sound perfect?
d_ex_theater_09_19,It sure does.
d_ex_theater_09_20,Did you get all that?
d_ex_theater_09_21,Y-yep!
d_ex_theater_09_22,Leave it to us.
d_ex_theater_09_23,"Okay then, let's get started. Drop the beat!"
d_ex_theater_09_24,*Boom boom boom boom*
d_ex_theater_09_25,"A propulsive beat starts playing through the speakers,"
d_ex_theater_09_26,and intense red lights flood the stage.
d_ex_theater_09_27,*Clap clap clap clap*
d_ex_theater_09_28,"C'mon, everyone, put your hands together!"
d_ex_theater_09_29,*Clap clap clap clap*
d_ex_theater_09_30,Let's go! Turn up the volume!
d_ex_theater_09_31,"Say it with me now: Go, Volume!"
d_ex_theater_09_32,V-O-L-U-M... Whooooa!
d_ex_theater_09_33,*Crash*
d_ex_theater_09_34,"While running up to the front of the stage, Clay takes a hard tumble."
d_ex_theater_09_35,What the...?!
d_ex_theater_09_36,Stop!
d_ex_theater_09_37,"The moment Volume shouts, all speakers and lights go out instantaneously, plunging the stage into silence."
d_ex_theater_09_38,"Hey, what the heck was that?"
d_ex_theater_09_39,"Sorry, I messed up the routine..."
d_ex_theater_09_40,Sorry won't cut it.
d_ex_theater_09_41,This isn't some kids' talent show.
d_ex_theater_09_42,What?
d_ex_theater_09_43,"Manager, didn't you say these two were professionals?"
d_ex_theater_09_44,... They are.
d_ex_theater_09_45,Then how do you explain this?
d_ex_theater_09_46,This is the furthest thing possible from professional.
d_ex_theater_09_47,"You, what was your name again... Clay?"
d_ex_theater_09_48,Yes?
d_ex_theater_09_49,Get out.
d_ex_theater_09_50,Wh-what?
d_ex_theater_09_51,Did I stutter? I said get out.
d_ex_theater_09_52,"Hey, that's enough."
d_ex_theater_09_53,"Oh, don't think I forgot about you. What's your problem?"
d_ex_theater_09_54,You call yourself a leader? You can't even handle your one and only teammate.
d_ex_theater_09_55,... What?
d_ex_theater_09_56,She doesn't have what it takes to hang with the professionals.
d_ex_theater_09_57,Watch it. You shouldn't underestimate Clay.
d_ex_theater_09_58,Things are starting to get heated between Bay and Volume.
d_ex_theater_09_59,"All right, everyone, let's just calm down..."
d_ex_theater_09_60,"Please, just give me one more chance!"
d_ex_theater_09_61,!!
d_ex_theater_09_62,...
d_ex_theater_09_63,"I made a mistake, that's all."
d_ex_theater_09_64,"If you give me one more chance, I won't mess up, promise!"
d_ex_theater_09_65,Clay...
d_ex_theater_09_66,Why would I waste my time gi...
d_ex_theater_09_67,Volume.
d_ex_theater_09_68,What?
d_ex_theater_09_69,Let her try again. Trust me.
d_ex_theater_09_70,... Fine. If you insist.
d_ex_theater_09_71,But this is your last shot. No more second chances after this.
d_ex_theater_09_72,"I understand, thank you!"
d_ex_theater_09_73,*Boom boom boom boom*
d_ex_theater_09_74,"Once again, the speakers begin to vibrate as Bay and Clay energetically leap onto the stage."
d_ex_theater_09_75,*Clap clap clap clap*
d_ex_theater_09_76,"Everyone, clap your hands!"
d_ex_theater_09_77,*Clap clap clap clap*
d_ex_theater_09_78,Let's go! Turn up the volume!
d_ex_theater_09_79,"Say it with me now: Go, Volume!"
d_ex_theater_09_80,"The part where Clay slipped up before arrives, and..."
d_ex_theater_09_81,V-O-L-U-M...!
d_ex_theater_09_82,*Shake*
d_ex_theater_09_83,Clay's body begins to sway as if she's losing her balance.
d_ex_theater_09_84,...!
d_ex_theater_09_85,...
d_ex_theater_09_86,"Clay bites her lip,"
d_ex_theater_09_87,pouring all her strength into stabilizing her slipping leg.
d_ex_theater_09_88,... E!
d_ex_theater_09_89,"Having barely managed not to fall over, Clay proceeds to shake her pompoms energetically."
d_ex_theater_09_90,"When I say ""Volume"", you say ""Let's go""!"
d_ex_theater_09_91,Volume!
d_ex_theater_09_92,Let's go!
d_ex_theater_09_93,Volume!
d_ex_theater_09_94,Let's go!
d_ex_theater_09_95,"All right, it's my turn."
d_ex_theater_09_96,*Boom*
d_ex_theater_09_97,"With a thunderous boom that's loud enough to tear the stage asunder, Volume makes a dramatic entrance."
d_ex_theater_09_98,Are y'all ready to go wild and scream like crazy?
d_ex_theater_09_99,Ahhhhhhhhhh!!
d_ex_theater_09_100,The intense practice session continues for some time.
d_ex_theater_09_101,A few moments later.
d_ex_theater_09_102,"Manager, can you get me some water?"
d_ex_theater_09_103,Sure. You did great out there.
d_ex_theater_09_104,"Yeah, that was awesome!"
d_ex_theater_09_105,You two were fantastic as well.
d_ex_theater_09_106,"Thanks, Coach."
d_ex_theater_09_107,"Hey, Clay!"
d_ex_theater_09_108,Yes?
d_ex_theater_09_109,Your steps were still unsteady during the climax.
d_ex_theater_09_110,I... I'm sorry.
d_ex_theater_09_111,Don't let it happen during the actual concert.
d_ex_theater_09_112,Okay?
d_ex_theater_09_113,...!
d_ex_theater_09_114,I won't! Thank you!
d_ex_theater_09_115,"All right, that's enough practice for today."
d_ex_theater_09_116,You all can leave.
d_ex_theater_09_117,What about you?
d_ex_theater_09_118,I'll be staying to double-check the lighting and stage setup some more.
d_ex_theater_09_119,I want to stay and practice a bit more!
d_ex_theater_09_120,Me too.
d_ex_theater_09_121,That won't be necessary. We've still got quite a bit of time until the concert.
d_ex_theater_09_122,You can take the rest of the day off. It's fine.
d_ex_theater_09_123,"No, I want to keep practicing until I master that part I was having trouble with."
d_ex_theater_09_124,"Ah, I see... So that's what's going on."
d_ex_theater_09_125,Hmm?
d_ex_theater_09_126,"All right then, let's wind it back and do it one more time!"
d_ex_theater_09_127,!!
d_ex_theater_09_128,Okay!
d_ex_theater_09_129,"Got it, let's go!"
d_ex_theater_09_130,"That night, the Theater at the Outpost kept its lights on until late."
d_ex_library_09_title,Ein's Secret Hideout
d_ex_library_09_1,I drop by the Library since it has been a while since my last visit.
d_ex_library_09_2,"I eventually select a book with an eye-catching title, and am just about to start reading it, when..."
d_ex_library_09_3,Zzzzz...
d_ex_library_09_4,Zzzzzzzz...
d_ex_library_09_5,Mmm... Hmm?  Ahhh... that was a good nap.
d_ex_library_09_6,...
d_ex_library_09_7,I try to ignore the distracting sounds and focus on my reading.
d_ex_library_09_8,*Babam*!
d_ex_library_09_9,Haha!
d_ex_library_09_10,What is this? Hahaha!
d_ex_library_09_11,...
d_ex_library_09_12,I snap the book shut and head towards the noise.
d_ex_library_09_13,"Over in another corner, Ein is cackling while looking at her tablet."
d_ex_library_09_14,"Oh, hi Teacher!"
d_ex_library_09_15,Did you just get here?
d_ex_library_09_16,"No, I've been here a while."
d_ex_library_09_17,"Whoa, really? I had no idea."
d_ex_library_09_18,Am I being too noisy?
d_ex_library_09_19,"Sorry, I didn't think anyone else was here."
d_ex_library_09_20,What are you watching?
d_ex_library_09_21,Just some random videos.
d_ex_library_09_22,"Can I tell you a secret, Teacher?"
d_ex_library_09_23,This place is kind of my secret hideout.
d_ex_library_09_24,The library?
d_ex_library_09_25,Yep!
d_ex_library_09_26,"Very few people come here, so it's nice and quiet."
d_ex_library_09_27,"I can sleep, talk as loud as I want, and make a ruckus without worrying about disturbing other people."
d_ex_library_09_28,Being surrounded by the smell of books is also a plus.
d_ex_library_09_29,It feels like I've rented out the whole place for myself.
d_ex_library_09_30,I often come here when I need some alone time.
d_ex_library_09_31,But doesn't the school have its own reading room?
d_ex_library_09_32,"Come on, Teacher, use your head!"
d_ex_library_09_33,The school reading room is always packed with people.
d_ex_library_09_34,I can't relax and get comfortable over there like I can here.
d_ex_library_09_35,"By the way, you've got to keep this all a secret, okay?"
d_ex_library_09_36,Why?
d_ex_library_09_37,"What do you mean ""why""?"
d_ex_library_09_38,"If any of the teachers or my friends at school find out about this, I won't hear the end of it."
d_ex_library_09_39,Just thinking about it gives me a headache.
d_ex_library_09_40,"So please, keep this between us."
d_ex_library_09_41,"By the way, you came here to read, didn't you?"
d_ex_library_09_42,I'll put on my headphones to watch my videos.
d_ex_library_09_43,I'll be quiet so you can get back to your book.
d_ex_library_09_44,?!
d_ex_library_09_45,Hmm?
d_ex_library_09_46,"Hello, Commander."
d_ex_library_09_47,Ein?
d_ex_library_09_48,What brings you two here?
d_ex_library_09_49,"I came here to read, and Ein is here to rela..."
d_ex_library_09_50,I-I...
d_ex_library_09_51,I came here to read too!
d_ex_library_09_52,... You did?
d_ex_library_09_53,"Ah, yes."
d_ex_library_09_54,Did you come to read up on the material related to the homework I gave today?
d_ex_library_09_55,Y-yeah! That's it!
d_ex_library_09_56,Teacher was helping me find the right book.
d_ex_library_09_57,"Isn't that right, Teacher?"
d_ex_library_09_58,Ein looks up at me pleadingly.
d_ex_library_09_59,I recall how she desperately begged me to keep her hideaway a secret.
d_ex_library_09_60,"... Yes, that's right."
d_ex_library_09_61,Why come all the way out here?
d_ex_library_09_62,You could have easily found something in the school library.
d_ex_library_09_63,Um... that's because I can't concentrate in the school library!
d_ex_library_09_64,"There are way too many people in there,"
d_ex_library_09_65,but it's nice and quiet over here.
d_ex_library_09_66,"Mmm, that's very true."
d_ex_library_09_67,"Still, I'm surprised."
d_ex_library_09_68,"You've never taken your classwork that seriously,"
d_ex_library_09_69,but now you're willing to come all the way out here?
d_ex_library_09_70,"If it's all right with you, can you show me what you've learned so far?"
d_ex_library_09_71,I could quiz you.
d_ex_library_09_72,"A-actually, I'm nearly finished!"
d_ex_library_09_73,I'll show you tomorrow!
d_ex_library_09_74,"Thanks a lot for helping me find the book I needed, Teacher."
d_ex_library_09_75,I better get going!
d_ex_library_09_76,Ein scurries off.
d_ex_library_09_77,She really is something.
d_ex_library_09_78,I'm curious to see what she'll have prepared for me tomorrow.
d_ex_library_09_79,...
d_ex_library_09_80,Marciana smiles proudly.
d_ex_library_09_81,I don't have the heart to tell her the truth.
d_ex_shopping_09_title,Comrade Found!
d_ex_shopping_09_1,"Teacher, Hi!"
d_ex_shopping_09_2,Are you here to shop?
d_ex_shopping_09_3,I sure am. How about you?
d_ex_shopping_09_4,Same. Today is the day that
d_ex_shopping_09_5,Rushae's new arrivals are being revealed!
d_ex_shopping_09_6,"One of them is something you can only purchase in person,"
d_ex_shopping_09_7,so I came to check it out.
d_ex_shopping_09_8,"Hold on, isn't that..."
d_ex_shopping_09_9,Naga and Tia?
d_ex_shopping_09_10,*Hug*
d_ex_shopping_09_11,!
d_ex_shopping_09_12,"Wow, a direct charge! Nicely done."
d_ex_shopping_09_13,"Before I have a chance to stop her, Tia is hugging me tight."
d_ex_shopping_09_14,It's Teacher!
d_ex_shopping_09_15,"Tia, you startled them both."
d_ex_shopping_09_16,You ought to give them a proper greeting first.
d_ex_shopping_09_17,"Oh, right, hehe. Sorry."
d_ex_shopping_09_18,"Hi, Teacher. Hi, Ein."
d_ex_shopping_09_19,Did you both arrange to hang out here?
d_ex_shopping_09_20,"No, we ran into each other only a moment ago."
d_ex_shopping_09_21,"Teacher is here to shop,"
d_ex_shopping_09_22,and I'm here to see the new arrivals from Rushae.
d_ex_shopping_09_23,"Ha, what a coincidence!"
d_ex_shopping_09_24,We're here to see them as well.
d_ex_shopping_09_25,No kidding!
d_ex_shopping_09_26,Are you both fans of Rushae too?
d_ex_shopping_09_27,We certainly are!
d_ex_shopping_09_28,"Well, actually, Naga is more of a fan than me."
d_ex_shopping_09_29,I love how modern their designs are.
d_ex_shopping_09_30,"And don't get me started on their accessories, hehe."
d_ex_shopping_09_31,This is incredible!
d_ex_shopping_09_32,I didn't expect to find a fellow fashionista so close to home.
d_ex_shopping_09_33,Really?
d_ex_shopping_09_34,"From the way I've seen you dress,"
d_ex_shopping_09_35,I always knew you were someone who had an interest in fashion.
d_ex_shopping_09_36,Really?
d_ex_shopping_09_37,Is it that obvious?
d_ex_shopping_09_38,I don't usually go for clothes that stand out too much.
d_ex_shopping_09_39,"It's not that you stood out, necessarily, but simply that you clearly have a great fashion sense."
d_ex_shopping_09_40,"You're always so well-dressed, and your outfits are so well-coordinated."
d_ex_shopping_09_41,"The accessories on your bag are especially cute,"
d_ex_shopping_09_42,and I love the modern feel of your earrings and choker.
d_ex_shopping_09_43,Can I ask where you got them?
d_ex_shopping_09_44,"Oh, these?"
d_ex_shopping_09_45,I found these in some hidden corner
d_ex_shopping_09_46,in the Ark's shopping district.
d_ex_shopping_09_47,Really?
d_ex_shopping_09_48,Any chance you could tell me how to get there?
d_ex_shopping_09_49,Ein and Naga are practically beaming as they continue their conversation.
d_ex_shopping_09_50,"Teacher,"
d_ex_shopping_09_51,I feel like they're going to take a while.
d_ex_shopping_09_52,Didn't you say you had to buy something?
d_ex_shopping_09_53,Let's go shopping together.
d_ex_shopping_09_54,Okay.
d_ex_shopping_09_55,"Even after I've bought what I needed,"
d_ex_shopping_09_56,Ein and Naga are still in mid-conversation when we return.
d_ex_shopping_09_57,Are you hungry?
d_ex_shopping_09_58,Want to go grab some dessert?
d_ex_shopping_09_59,Sure.
d_ex_shopping_09_60,A moment later.
d_ex_shopping_09_61,Isn't this latest release simply superb?
d_ex_shopping_09_62,There's one item I've really had my eye on...
d_ex_shopping_09_63,Ah!
d_ex_shopping_09_64,There it is!
d_ex_shopping_09_65,"Oh, right!"
d_ex_shopping_09_66,"I absolutely adore this, too!"
d_ex_shopping_09_67,...
d_ex_shopping_09_68,...
d_ex_shopping_09_69,Hehe.
d_ex_shopping_09_70,"How about we head out, Teacher?"
d_ex_shopping_09_71,... Okay.
d_ex_shopping_09_72,"Tia and I head out of the Shopping Mall,"
d_ex_shopping_09_73,leaving Ein and Naga in their own world.
d_ex_trainstation_08_title,Exact Preference
d_ex_trainstation_08_1,"Thank you for coming along, Teacher."
d_ex_trainstation_08_2,"Ugh, why do we have to go on a field trip anyway?"
d_ex_trainstation_08_3,"Not only do we have to schlep out here and watch the hologram explaining the Ark Express' entire history,"
d_ex_trainstation_08_4,we've also got to write a report about it.
d_ex_trainstation_08_5,"Aaarrgh, just thinking about it makes me so annoyed."
d_ex_trainstation_08_6,Let's get it over and done with.
d_ex_trainstation_08_7,Can we go do some karaoke after?
d_ex_trainstation_08_8,Deal.
d_ex_trainstation_08_9,Nice! That gives me some much-needed motivation.
d_ex_trainstation_08_10,I'll do my best.
d_ex_trainstation_08_11,"Now, where do we have to go, exactly?"
d_ex_trainstation_08_12,This place is bigger than I thought...
d_ex_trainstation_08_13,Candies♪
d_ex_trainstation_08_14,Strawberry candies for you♪
d_ex_trainstation_08_15,"Off in the distance, Diesel's singsong voice can be heard."
d_ex_trainstation_08_16,Huh?
d_ex_trainstation_08_17,Teacher...
d_ex_trainstation_08_18,What's that sound?
d_ex_trainstation_08_19,Is there a vending machine that's broken?
d_ex_trainstation_08_20,"No, that's..."
d_ex_trainstation_08_21,"Wait, I see her!"
d_ex_trainstation_08_22,Let's head over there.
d_ex_trainstation_08_23,"Ein and I head over to Diesel,"
d_ex_trainstation_08_24,who is humming a tune while cleaning.
d_ex_trainstation_08_25,...
d_ex_trainstation_08_26,Hmm?
d_ex_trainstation_08_27,It's what everyone likes!
d_ex_trainstation_08_28,"Hello, Diesel."
d_ex_trainstation_08_29,Oh.
d_ex_trainstation_08_30,Hi Commander!
d_ex_trainstation_08_31,And you are...?
d_ex_trainstation_08_32,Hi.
d_ex_trainstation_08_33,I'm Ein from the M.M.R. Vocational School.
d_ex_trainstation_08_34,Diesel... right?
d_ex_trainstation_08_35,Was that you singing a while ago?
d_ex_trainstation_08_36,That's right!
d_ex_trainstation_08_37,It's my favorite song.
d_ex_trainstation_08_38,I've been practicing every day. Would you like to hear it from the beginning?
d_ex_trainstation_08_39,"Oh, sure!"
d_ex_trainstation_08_40,"Candies, strawberry candies for you♪"
d_ex_trainstation_08_41,"Diesel's voice spreads throughout the Train Station, sounding oddly like an old tune coming out from a vending machine."
d_ex_trainstation_08_42,"After a few moments, she finishes her song."
d_ex_trainstation_08_43,"Hehe, how was it?"
d_ex_trainstation_08_44,...
d_ex_trainstation_08_45,Ein?
d_ex_trainstation_08_46,It...
d_ex_trainstation_08_47,was amazing!
d_ex_trainstation_08_48,Totally the coolest!
d_ex_trainstation_08_49,Are you a singer by any chance?
d_ex_trainstation_08_50,I'm afraid not.
d_ex_trainstation_08_51,Do you use social media?
d_ex_trainstation_08_52,"Not really, no."
d_ex_trainstation_08_53,"Darn, that's too bad."
d_ex_trainstation_08_54,"If you posted videos of your singing, I think it'd be a big hit!"
d_ex_trainstation_08_55,Some people may even want to challenge you in a sing-off. It'd be huge!
d_ex_trainstation_08_56,... You really think so?
d_ex_trainstation_08_57,"Hehe, it seems you really like my singing."
d_ex_trainstation_08_58,Of course!
d_ex_trainstation_08_59,"I didn't just like it, I loved it!"
d_ex_trainstation_08_60,Your voice is almost too perfect to be true.
d_ex_trainstation_08_61,"Oh, we can't waste our time chatting here."
d_ex_trainstation_08_62,Teacher!
d_ex_trainstation_08_63,Yes?
d_ex_trainstation_08_64,Let's hurry to the karaoke.
d_ex_trainstation_08_65,"You too, Diesel."
d_ex_trainstation_08_66,"You're not busy, are you? Is this a good time?"
d_ex_trainstation_08_67,Karaoke?
d_ex_trainstation_08_68,"Sounds fun, hehe."
d_ex_trainstation_08_69,"Sure, I can come. I just finished cleaning."
d_ex_trainstation_08_70,Awesome!
d_ex_trainstation_08_71,I wanna hear you sing in a karaoke bar.
d_ex_trainstation_08_72,Let's hurry!
d_ex_trainstation_08_73,What about the field trip?
d_ex_trainstation_08_74,We can do that later!
d_ex_trainstation_08_75,To the karaoke bar!
d_ex_trainstation_08_77,"I am dragged along to the karaoke bar,"
d_ex_trainstation_08_78,where I'm forced to listen to Diesel's singing for an entire hour.
d_ex_gym_08_title,Bodyweight Exercises
d_ex_gym_08_1,"It's been a while since I last got some exercise, so I decide to head to the gym."
d_ex_gym_08_2,"H-hi, Teacher!"
d_ex_gym_08_3,"Hi, Zwei."
d_ex_gym_08_4,Are you here to work out?
d_ex_gym_08_5,Yeah.
d_ex_gym_08_6,"Keeping yourself fit is important for performing well academically,"
d_ex_gym_08_7,but Teacher...
d_ex_gym_08_8,Um... can you perhaps guide me on how to work out?
d_ex_gym_08_9,Hmm?
d_ex_gym_08_10,"Actually, this is my first time exercising on my own."
d_ex_gym_08_11,"At the school, the teachers always tell us what to do,"
d_ex_gym_08_12,so all I had to do was follow along.
d_ex_gym_08_13,"But here, I'm not quite sure what I should be doing."
d_ex_gym_08_14,"And to be honest, all of this equipment looks quite unfamiliar to me as well."
d_ex_gym_08_15,"In that case, how about starting with bodyweight exercises?"
d_ex_gym_08_16,Gah!
d_ex_gym_08_17,Centi?
d_ex_gym_08_18,When did you get here?
d_ex_gym_08_19,I've been working out here for a while now!
d_ex_gym_08_20,I guess you missed me tucked away in the corner!
d_ex_gym_08_21,"Anyhow, starting with bodyweight exercises could be a good way to kick things off for you."
d_ex_gym_08_22,Like what?
d_ex_gym_08_23,Let's start off with a basic planche.
d_ex_gym_08_24,Just do as I do!
d_ex_gym_08_25,"Centi gets into a traditional push-up position,"
d_ex_gym_08_26,"and then lifts her body horizontally, supporting herself only with her hands."
d_ex_gym_08_27,Amazing!
d_ex_gym_08_28,You consider that a basic move?
d_ex_gym_08_29,Of course!
d_ex_gym_08_30,"Anyone can do this exercise, no problem!"
d_ex_gym_08_31,Really?
d_ex_gym_08_32,Let me try!
d_ex_gym_08_33,"Zwei, filled with enthusiasm, gets into a push-up position,"
d_ex_gym_08_34,and attempts to lift her legs up off the ground.
d_ex_gym_08_35,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_08_36,Ouch...
d_ex_gym_08_37,Are you okay?
d_ex_gym_08_38,I'm fine. Let me try again!
d_ex_gym_08_39,*Thud*
d_ex_gym_08_40,One more time!
d_ex_gym_08_41,Zwei tries to imitate Centi's posture several more times
d_ex_gym_08_42,but continually fails when trying to lift up her legs.
d_ex_gym_08_43,"*Huff, huff*"
d_ex_gym_08_44,This move seems quite advanced.
d_ex_gym_08_45,Do you have anything easier?
d_ex_gym_08_46,A simpler exercise?
d_ex_gym_08_47,How about Dragon Flag?
d_ex_gym_08_48,Just watch me and follow along!
d_ex_gym_08_49,Centi lies on a bench and grabs the end of it with her hands.
d_ex_gym_08_50,She then lifts her lower body up into the air until it is nearly vertical.
d_ex_gym_08_51,No way!
d_ex_gym_08_52,Is this really easier than the planche?
d_ex_gym_08_53,Absolutely!
d_ex_gym_08_54,Even Liter can do this without much effort!
d_ex_gym_08_55,All right then.
d_ex_gym_08_56,Let's give it a shot!
d_ex_gym_08_57,"Filled with a renewed sense of eagerness, Zwei attempts to copy Centi's pose."
d_ex_gym_08_58,*Groan*
d_ex_gym_08_59,*Grunt*
d_ex_gym_08_60,"Lifting up her lower half, however, proves difficult."
d_ex_gym_08_61,"*Huff, huff*"
d_ex_gym_08_62,"Hmm, you can't do this exercise either?"
d_ex_gym_08_63,How about this one?
d_ex_gym_08_64,It's called the L-sit.
d_ex_gym_08_65,"Centi continues to cycle through her impressive bodyweight exercises,"
d_ex_gym_08_66,but Zwei hasn't been able to mimic a single one perfectly.
d_ex_gym_08_67,"T-Teacher... *Huff, huff*"
d_ex_gym_08_68,"I *huff* thought I was doing all right at P.E. in school,"
d_ex_gym_08_69,but after my performance here today... *Huff*
d_ex_gym_08_70,I realize how *huff* mistaken I was.
d_ex_gym_08_71,I've got to get into the habit of coming here and working out.
d_ex_gym_08_72,That's a great idea!
d_ex_gym_08_73,I'll be more than happy to help you whenever you stop by.
d_ex_gym_08_74,Th-thanks!
d_ex_gym_08_75,"Once Centi and Zwei finish talking, they resume their impressive bodyweight exercises."
d_ex_gym_08_76,Wouldn't it be better to start from the basics?
d_ex_gym_08_77,My proposal goes unheard.
d_ex_hospital_08_title,"A Physical, a Wager"
d_ex_hospital_08_1,"Zwei asked me to join her and her friends for their regular physicals, so I meet them at the hospital."
d_ex_hospital_08_2,"Heya, Teacher!"
d_ex_hospital_08_3,"Hello, Teacher."
d_ex_hospital_08_4,"Teacher, you're here!"
d_ex_hospital_08_5,Thanks for coming on such short notice.
d_ex_hospital_08_6,Zwei lowers her voice.
d_ex_hospital_08_7,"These physicals are really important for us Nikkes,"
d_ex_hospital_08_8,but Rei and Ein are always coming up with excuses to skip them.
d_ex_hospital_08_9,"I wanted to make sure they get it done this time, so that's why I asked for your help."
d_ex_hospital_08_10,Got it. I'll see what I can do.
d_ex_hospital_08_11,"I can't thank you enough, Teacher."
d_ex_hospital_08_12,What are you two whispering about?
d_ex_hospital_08_13,Let us in on the secret!
d_ex_hospital_08_14,How come we're meeting
d_ex_hospital_08_15,"at the hospital, anyway?"
d_ex_hospital_08_16,"Yeah,"
d_ex_hospital_08_17,what's up with that?
d_ex_hospital_08_18,"Hold on, we're not scheduled for our physicals today, are we?"
d_ex_hospital_08_19,!
d_ex_hospital_08_20,!!
d_ex_hospital_08_21,What?
d_ex_hospital_08_22,"Zwei, is that true?"
d_ex_hospital_08_23,... I just remembered I have homework.
d_ex_hospital_08_24,"Y-yeah, me too!"
d_ex_hospital_08_25,"I'm supposed to do homework with Ein, too!"
d_ex_hospital_08_26,"Just a second, you two."
d_ex_hospital_08_27,I have something to tell you.
d_ex_hospital_08_28,"Send us a text, Teacher."
d_ex_hospital_08_29,We're outta here!
d_ex_hospital_08_30,"Ein and Rei are just about to leave, when..."
d_ex_hospital_08_31,Wait!
d_ex_hospital_08_32,Let's make a bet!
d_ex_hospital_08_33,Both of them stop dead in their tracks upon hearing Zwei's proposal.
d_ex_hospital_08_34,Did I hear that right?
d_ex_hospital_08_35,"Did you just say something about a bet, Zwei?"
d_ex_hospital_08_36,"Yes, I did."
d_ex_hospital_08_37,You both are always bummed out when I don't join in on the bets.
d_ex_hospital_08_38,I won't be sitting this one out today.
d_ex_hospital_08_39,So let's make a bet.
d_ex_hospital_08_40,"Whoever is most diligent about getting their physical done, wins."
d_ex_hospital_08_41,Seriously?
d_ex_hospital_08_42,That's it?
d_ex_hospital_08_43,What's the prize?
d_ex_hospital_08_44,"If you win, Rei, I'll help you with your homework for a month."
d_ex_hospital_08_45,You won't hear me complain a single bit.
d_ex_hospital_08_46,I'll help you as much as you want.
d_ex_hospital_08_47,Really?
d_ex_hospital_08_48,Yes.
d_ex_hospital_08_49,"If Ein wins, I'll go with you to karaoke for a month."
d_ex_hospital_08_50,"Once again, no moaning or groaning from me."
d_ex_hospital_08_51,I'll even play the tambourine and sing duets.
d_ex_hospital_08_52,"Wow, really?"
d_ex_hospital_08_53,"You hate karaoke, though. What's the catch?"
d_ex_hospital_08_54,No takebacks!
d_ex_hospital_08_55,You have my word.
d_ex_hospital_08_56,"However, if I win,"
d_ex_hospital_08_57,both of you have to behave and get your next physical done properly.
d_ex_hospital_08_58,Who decides the winner?
d_ex_hospital_08_59,Um...
d_ex_hospital_08_60,"Teacher will decide that,"
d_ex_hospital_08_61,"won't you, Teacher?"
d_ex_hospital_08_62,"I nod, unable to refuse Zwei as she looks at me pleadingly."
d_ex_hospital_08_63,I've got this in the bag.
d_ex_hospital_08_64,I'm renowned for being a hard worker!
d_ex_hospital_08_65,Don't be ridiculous!
d_ex_hospital_08_66,Everyone knows that upperclassmen are the most diligent!
d_ex_hospital_08_67,Victory is mine!
d_ex_hospital_08_68,Rei and Ein both rush into the examination room.
d_ex_hospital_08_69,...
d_ex_hospital_08_70,"Thank you, Teacher."
d_ex_hospital_08_71,You did all the work.
d_ex_hospital_08_72,"No, you did plenty."
d_ex_hospital_08_73,They only agreed to meet us here
d_ex_hospital_08_74,because I said you suggested it.
d_ex_hospital_08_75,I didn't expect them to agree to this so easily.
d_ex_hospital_08_76,They love anything that involves wagers
d_ex_hospital_08_77,and the prizes I mentioned are just too tempting to resist.
d_ex_hospital_08_78,"Um... Teacher,"
d_ex_hospital_08_79,can I ask you one last favor?
d_ex_hospital_08_80,It's about deciding who's going to be the winner.
d_ex_hospital_08_81,You have to pick me.
d_ex_hospital_08_82,"I don't mind helping with homework,"
d_ex_hospital_08_83,but karaoke... I'm not so sure.
d_ex_hospital_08_84,"I'm sorry for them, but you have to help me."
d_ex_hospital_08_85,"Zwei turns to me and bows deeply,"
d_ex_hospital_08_86,then sheepishly enters the doctor's office.
d_ex_toyshop_09_title,"An Unexpected Place, An Unexpected Discovery"
d_ex_toyshop_09_1,*Ding dong*
d_ex_toyshop_09_2,"Old-Timer, hello!"
d_ex_toyshop_09_3,Welcome!
d_ex_toyshop_09_4,"Oh, Teacher?"
d_ex_toyshop_09_5,"Zwei, fancy seeing you here."
d_ex_toyshop_09_6,Are you here to buy toys?
d_ex_toyshop_09_7,"Oh no,"
d_ex_toyshop_09_8,I'm not here for that.
d_ex_toyshop_09_9,Huh?
d_ex_toyshop_09_10,What?
d_ex_toyshop_09_11,You're not?
d_ex_toyshop_09_12,But this is the Toy Store.
d_ex_toyshop_09_13,"I know,"
d_ex_toyshop_09_14,but Rei said you sell all kinds of interesting items here.
d_ex_toyshop_09_15,Things that improve your concentration
d_ex_toyshop_09_16,or help your grades go up.
d_ex_toyshop_09_17,"Oh,"
d_ex_toyshop_09_18,and snacks that help clear your mind.
d_ex_toyshop_09_19,...
d_ex_toyshop_09_20,Those all sound pretty fantastical to me.
d_ex_toyshop_09_21,"Hehe, you came to the right place!"
d_ex_toyshop_09_22,You should've just said that's what you were looking for.
d_ex_toyshop_09_23,"Hold on, you actually have stuff like that?"
d_ex_toyshop_09_24,"I don't know about every little thing she mentioned,"
d_ex_toyshop_09_25,but we do have candies that clear your mind.
d_ex_toyshop_09_26,I'll bring them over!
d_ex_toyshop_09_27,I'll fetch you something that boosts your concentration and memory.
d_ex_toyshop_09_28,A few moments later.
d_ex_toyshop_09_29,Ta-da!
d_ex_toyshop_09_30,Here it is!
d_ex_toyshop_09_31,I brought this too!
d_ex_toyshop_09_32,What's this?
d_ex_toyshop_09_33,That's quite a large box.
d_ex_toyshop_09_34,It looks like a board game.
d_ex_toyshop_09_35,"Great guess, Old-Timer!"
d_ex_toyshop_09_36,It's a board game that focuses on improving your concentration and memory.
d_ex_toyshop_09_37,A game?
d_ex_toyshop_09_38,That's not quite what I was looking for.
d_ex_toyshop_09_39,I don't think a game could really improve your cognitive skills all that much.
d_ex_toyshop_09_40,"Trust me, you'll change your mind once you try it."
d_ex_toyshop_09_41,"Come on, give it a shot."
d_ex_toyshop_09_42,And make sure to try this candy too.
d_ex_toyshop_09_43,"It'll help, guaranteed."
d_ex_toyshop_09_44,...
d_ex_toyshop_09_45,"Sure, just once."
d_ex_toyshop_09_46,Great!
d_ex_toyshop_09_47,"Why don't you join us, Old-Timer?"
d_ex_toyshop_09_48,"All right, let's start!"
d_ex_toyshop_09_49,I am unwittingly roped into playing the game.
d_ex_toyshop_09_50,One round later...
d_ex_toyshop_09_51,What the... you're doing great for your first time!
d_ex_toyshop_09_52,What'd you think?
d_ex_toyshop_09_53,Wow.
d_ex_toyshop_09_54,This game is more intense than I thought it'd be.
d_ex_toyshop_09_55,I think I'm getting hooked.
d_ex_toyshop_09_56,Did you have fun?
d_ex_toyshop_09_57,... Yeah.
d_ex_toyshop_09_58,"Plus, the candy Mica gave me seems to be working."
d_ex_toyshop_09_59,The refreshing sensation in my mouth made my mind feel clearer.
d_ex_toyshop_09_60,"Hehe, I'm glad it worked for you."
d_ex_toyshop_09_61,...
d_ex_toyshop_09_62,Let's play another round.
d_ex_toyshop_09_63,"Sure, this time I'll win!"
d_ex_toyshop_09_64,After another round.
d_ex_toyshop_09_65,Dang it! I lost again.
d_ex_toyshop_09_66,Let's go again.
d_ex_toyshop_09_67,After yet another round...
d_ex_toyshop_09_68,"Ugh... you're just too good at this, Zwei."
d_ex_toyshop_09_69,O-one more round.
d_ex_toyshop_09_70,"Zwei, are you okay?"
d_ex_toyshop_09_71,Your eyes look strange.
d_ex_toyshop_09_72,I-I'm fine.
d_ex_toyshop_09_73,Let's keep going!
d_ex_toyshop_09_75,"We kept playing late into the night,"
d_ex_toyshop_09_76,and Zwei ended up buying both the candy and the game.
d_ex_toyshop_09_77,I've heard that Zwei got addicted to that game for a while and just couldn't tear herself away.
d_ex_cafe_09_title,Cream Coffee vs Black Tea
d_ex_cafe_09_1,Cream coffee.
d_ex_cafe_09_2,Black tea.
d_ex_cafe_09_3,Cream coffee.
d_ex_cafe_09_4,Black tea.
d_ex_cafe_09_5,Uh...
d_ex_cafe_09_6,Tea. Bad.
d_ex_cafe_09_7,Customers. Hate it.
d_ex_cafe_09_8,I think otherwise.
d_ex_cafe_09_9,Cream is far too artificial and will undermine the flavor.
d_ex_cafe_09_10,"I dare say, a greater number of people would be inclined to avoid it."
d_ex_cafe_09_11,...
d_ex_cafe_09_12,Ugh. Stubborn.
d_ex_cafe_09_13,"Since you were the first to insult the tea, I have no intention of backing down."
d_ex_cafe_09_14,How about the two of you stop now?
d_ex_cafe_09_15,...
d_ex_cafe_09_16,Hmph.
d_ex_cafe_09_17,*Sigh*
d_ex_cafe_09_18,What's going on?
d_ex_cafe_09_19,"Hi, Highroller."
d_ex_cafe_09_20,"We're planning on incorporating a new drink into the menu this month,"
d_ex_cafe_09_21,and I thought these two could give me some ideas.
d_ex_cafe_09_22,But...
d_ex_cafe_09_23,Black tea.
d_ex_cafe_09_24,Cream coffee!
d_ex_cafe_09_25,They've done nothing but bicker with each other.
d_ex_cafe_09_26,"Isn't coffee already on the menu, though?"
d_ex_cafe_09_27,Tired of it.
d_ex_cafe_09_28,Cream. Not enough.
d_ex_cafe_09_29,Need more cream. Need new menu.
d_ex_cafe_09_30,"You need to make a decision, Rouge."
d_ex_cafe_09_31,A nice cup of fragrant tea will help customers relax and free their minds.
d_ex_cafe_09_32,I think it's obvious which drink will offer the greatest benefit to the customers.
d_ex_cafe_09_33,I believe you'll make the right choice.
d_ex_cafe_09_34,Hmm... I think both suggestions are valid.
d_ex_cafe_09_35,I'm torn.
d_ex_cafe_09_36,Which should I pick?
d_ex_cafe_09_37,How about you taste them first and decide afterwards?
d_ex_cafe_09_38,"Oh, that's a good idea."
d_ex_cafe_09_39,Good. My specialty. I'll show you.
d_ex_cafe_09_40,I believe I have some tea leaves left.
d_ex_cafe_09_41,I'll brew them for you.
d_ex_cafe_09_42,Let's get started then.
d_ex_cafe_09_43,*Clink clink*
d_ex_cafe_09_44,"You both have had some time, so let's stop here."
d_ex_cafe_09_45,Can you show me the drinks you've made?
d_ex_cafe_09_46,Perfect.
d_ex_cafe_09_47,... That was hardly enough time.
d_ex_cafe_09_48,I'm not sure if the leaves have had enough time to steep.
d_ex_cafe_09_49,Heh. That too. Skill.
d_ex_cafe_09_50,Don't be ridiculous.
d_ex_cafe_09_51,The act of waiting is one of the subtle joys of the tea-making process.
d_ex_cafe_09_52,It's not something meant to be rushed out as quickly as possible.
d_ex_cafe_09_53,So waiting itself can be an enjoyable process?
d_ex_cafe_09_54,That's... a new approach.
d_ex_cafe_09_55,Sakura and Frima each place down a cup.
d_ex_cafe_09_56,They both look excellent.
d_ex_cafe_09_57,Which should we try first?
d_ex_cafe_09_58,"Since the taste of coffee is stronger, the black tea..."
d_ex_cafe_09_59,Coffee first!
d_ex_cafe_09_60,No matter what!
d_ex_cafe_09_61,... Fine.
d_ex_cafe_09_62,"Then, the cream coffee..."
d_ex_cafe_09_63,*Sip*
d_ex_cafe_09_64,How does it taste?
d_ex_cafe_09_65,...
d_ex_cafe_09_66,...
d_ex_cafe_09_67,Rouge does not answer.
d_ex_cafe_09_68,I'll take a sip.
d_ex_cafe_09_69,*Sip*
d_ex_cafe_09_70,!!!
d_ex_cafe_09_71,Well?
d_ex_cafe_09_72,Fallen for it?
d_ex_cafe_09_73,It's... unforgettable.
d_ex_cafe_09_74,Proud.
d_ex_cafe_09_75,Might I inquire as to the recipe?
d_ex_cafe_09_76,One part coffee. Nine parts cream.
d_ex_cafe_09_77,New menu. Special.
d_ex_cafe_09_78,... That explains the taste.
d_ex_cafe_09_79,Why don't we try Sakura's?
d_ex_cafe_09_80,I need to cleanse my palate. Quickly.
d_ex_cafe_09_81,"Sure, let's try it!"
d_ex_cafe_09_82,"Haha, there's no need to hurry."
d_ex_cafe_09_83,*Sip*
d_ex_cafe_09_84,...
d_ex_cafe_09_85,?
d_ex_cafe_09_86,Highroller.
d_ex_cafe_09_87,I... I think I need to head to the Repair Center for a moment.
d_ex_cafe_09_88,What do you mean?
d_ex_cafe_09_89,*Slide*
d_ex_cafe_09_90,Rouge passes me the teacup without any further explanation.
d_ex_cafe_09_91,?
d_ex_cafe_09_92,*Sip*
d_ex_cafe_09_93,!!
d_ex_cafe_09_94,I don't taste anything.
d_ex_cafe_09_95,The intense flavors of the cream still linger in my mouth and have completely overpowered the subtle notes of the tea.
d_ex_cafe_09_96,How is it?
d_ex_cafe_09_97,Please do give me an honest assessment.
d_ex_cafe_09_98,... I'm not in any condition to be offering a review right now.
d_ex_cafe_09_99,Coffee wins?
d_ex_cafe_09_100,Sakura and Frima both look at us with confident expressions.
d_ex_cafe_09_101,Who loses?
d_ex_cafe_09_102,If I'm being honest...
d_ex_cafe_09_103,"The coffee is a bit too strong, and the tea is slightly weak."
d_ex_cafe_09_104,So both...
d_ex_cafe_09_105,??
d_ex_cafe_09_106,... aren't quite what you're looking for.
d_ex_cafe_09_107,...
d_ex_cafe_09_108,I'll take both.
d_ex_cafe_09_109,Oh?
d_ex_cafe_09_110,May I ask why?
d_ex_cafe_09_111,"After watching you both make your beverages, I came to a few conclusions."
d_ex_cafe_09_112,The cream coffee is great for a guaranteed quick dose of caffeine.
d_ex_cafe_09_113,"The tea, although more time-consuming, relaxes both the body and mind."
d_ex_cafe_09_114,Each has their own unique appeal.
d_ex_cafe_09_115,"You'll have customers who want to get jazzed up to keep playing as many games as possible, and others who want to take a load off after playing."
d_ex_cafe_09_116,You really are tuned into what the customers want.
d_ex_cafe_09_117,Of course. Coin Rush offers a variety of experiences.
d_ex_cafe_09_118,"We want to also provide a range of diverse experiences, even with our simple drink menu."
d_ex_cafe_09_119,Heartwarming conclusion.
d_ex_cafe_09_120,"I knew you would understand, Rouge."
d_ex_cafe_09_121,"Of course, we'll need to make some tweaks on our end to improve the taste."
d_ex_cafe_09_122,"If you come back soon, I'll make sure that you're not disappointed."
d_ex_cafe_09_123,Good.
d_ex_cafe_09_124,I'll visit soon with some of my men.
d_ex_cafe_09_125,Good. I visit too.
d_ex_cafe_09_126,"And so, the battle between Sakura and Frima draws to a close."
d_ex_cafe_09_127,"Later in the Drink Zone, we are able to enjoy both excellent black tea and cream coffee."
d_ex_modernbar_09_title,Drunk Customer
d_ex_modernbar_09_01,*Ring*
d_ex_modernbar_09_02,Hey! Hey!
d_ex_modernbar_09_03,...?
d_ex_modernbar_09_04,I can hear a commotion inside the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_09_05,Why can't I do it?!
d_ex_modernbar_09_06,Are you going to keep your promise?
d_ex_modernbar_09_07,I want one more round!
d_ex_modernbar_09_08,Rouge and Moran are sitting opposite each other at a table in the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_09_09,What are you two up to?
d_ex_modernbar_09_10,Cadet!
d_ex_modernbar_09_11,"We're... Hold on... Ah, right, we're playing a card game!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_12,You came to a bar to play cards?
d_ex_modernbar_09_13,"Moran had a bit too much to drink,"
d_ex_modernbar_09_14,"and so I suggested she head back to sleep it off, but she wouldn't lis..."
d_ex_modernbar_09_15,"Rouge said if I lose this game, then I have to stop protesting and leave."
d_ex_modernbar_09_16,She challenged me!
d_ex_modernbar_09_17,I can't back down from that!
d_ex_modernbar_09_18,... I'm starting to understand why she told you to head back.
d_ex_modernbar_09_19,Huh? What?
d_ex_modernbar_09_20,... Nothing.
d_ex_modernbar_09_21,"Anyway, let's continue."
d_ex_modernbar_09_22,Rouge lays out the cards on the table.
d_ex_modernbar_09_23,The rules are the same as before. You just need to find the cards with the same pattern.
d_ex_modernbar_09_24,I'll give you ten attempts.
d_ex_modernbar_09_25,"If you can find all the matching pairs within ten attempts, then you win."
d_ex_modernbar_09_26,"If you can't, I win."
d_ex_modernbar_09_27,"Ten attempts may sound like a lot, but it's not in reality, so be careful when choosing which cards to flip."
d_ex_modernbar_09_28,Are you ready?
d_ex_modernbar_09_29,Ready!
d_ex_modernbar_09_30,Moran confidently flips a card.
d_ex_modernbar_09_31,... Huh?
d_ex_modernbar_09_32,9 attempts left.
d_ex_modernbar_09_33,Wait.
d_ex_modernbar_09_34,?!
d_ex_modernbar_09_35,I've been suspecting this for a while.
d_ex_modernbar_09_36,"You're not pulling a fast one on me, are you?"
d_ex_modernbar_09_37,Of course not.
d_ex_modernbar_09_38,Do you want to check?
d_ex_modernbar_09_39,Rouge flips over the cards that have been laid out.
d_ex_modernbar_09_40,Every card here has a matching pair.
d_ex_modernbar_09_41,Certainly seems to be legit.
d_ex_modernbar_09_42,Of course.
d_ex_modernbar_09_43,I don't have to resort to dirty tricks to win.
d_ex_modernbar_09_44,...!
d_ex_modernbar_09_45,Are you insinuating that my skills are lacking?!
d_ex_modernbar_09_46,"I'm not sure about your skill when you're sober,"
d_ex_modernbar_09_47,"but when you're drunk, they're definitely..."
d_ex_modernbar_09_48,...!
d_ex_modernbar_09_49,Aaaaarrgh!
d_ex_modernbar_09_50,Shall we continue?
d_ex_modernbar_09_51,"All right, fine. This one's gonna be it!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_52,...
d_ex_modernbar_09_53,I thought for sure those two were matching...
d_ex_modernbar_09_54,One more time!
d_ex_modernbar_09_55,Sure. Let's keep going.
d_ex_modernbar_09_56,I can't believe this!
d_ex_modernbar_09_57,This doesn't make any sense! How can I not find a single matching pair?
d_ex_modernbar_09_58,Am I really that bad at this?
d_ex_modernbar_09_59,Are you giving up?
d_ex_modernbar_09_60,Never! One more round!
d_ex_modernbar_09_61,A moment later.
d_ex_modernbar_09_62,Er...
d_ex_modernbar_09_63,Uh...
d_ex_modernbar_09_64,"Are you okay, Moran?"
d_ex_modernbar_09_65,I... I think you're right.
d_ex_modernbar_09_66,"I can't best you, not when I'm drunk."
d_ex_modernbar_09_67,...
d_ex_modernbar_09_68,I'm leaving.
d_ex_modernbar_09_69,Moran shuffles off as if her soul has left her body.
d_ex_modernbar_09_70,She left.
d_ex_modernbar_09_71,That she did.
d_ex_modernbar_09_72,She seemed to be in such a good mood before. I feel bad that I seem to have ruined her day.
d_ex_modernbar_09_73,Did you think she'd cause trouble if she kept going?
d_ex_modernbar_09_74,Yes.
d_ex_modernbar_09_75,She was hooting and hollering something fierce.
d_ex_modernbar_09_76,I was worried that it might have made the other customers uncomfortable.
d_ex_modernbar_09_77,So that was your way of handling the matter quietly.
d_ex_modernbar_09_78,It's a method I often use when dealing with drunk people at the bar.
d_ex_modernbar_09_79,"When people are inebriated, their judgment becomes hazy. It becomes hard to distinguish the complex patterns on the cards."
d_ex_modernbar_09_80,"A professional way of handling the situation, as expected from you."
d_ex_modernbar_09_81,"Haha, thank you."
d_ex_modernbar_09_82,I'm sure Moran will understand someday.
d_ex_modernbar_09_83,*Ring*
d_ex_modernbar_09_84,"No, absolutely not! I won't stand for it!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_85,?
d_ex_modernbar_09_86,You're back?
d_ex_modernbar_09_87,I thought it over
d_ex_modernbar_09_88,and leaving like this doesn't sit right with me!
d_ex_modernbar_09_89,I have to win at least one round!
d_ex_modernbar_09_90,Have you sobered up?
d_ex_modernbar_09_91,Of course!
d_ex_modernbar_09_92,"I banged my head against a wall a few times, and I'm sober as a judge now."
d_ex_modernbar_09_93,...
d_ex_modernbar_09_94,...
d_ex_modernbar_09_95,What should we do?
d_ex_modernbar_09_96,"For those who are as persistent as her, I have another method."
d_ex_modernbar_09_97,What are you two whispering about?!
d_ex_modernbar_09_98,Let's do this!
d_ex_modernbar_09_99,"All right, please come this way."
d_ex_modernbar_09_100,*Swoosh swoosh swoosh*
d_ex_modernbar_09_101,"Okay, let's begin."
d_ex_modernbar_09_102,"All right, let's go!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_103,First... This one and this one!
d_ex_modernbar_09_104,Huh? A circle and a... square? Were the patterns this simple before?
d_ex_modernbar_09_105,I swear there were all sorts of funky patterns before...
d_ex_modernbar_09_106,You have 10 seconds left.
d_ex_modernbar_09_107,"Wait, there wasn't a rule like that before."
d_ex_modernbar_09_108,I've just added it.
d_ex_modernbar_09_109,"8, 7..."
d_ex_modernbar_09_110,W-wait a second! Don't rush me!
d_ex_modernbar_09_111,"In the new game, Moran is able to find the matching cards easily,"
d_ex_modernbar_09_112,which seems to fill her with immense joy.
d_ex_modernbar_09_113,Hahaha! You see that?!
d_ex_modernbar_09_114,"Ah, I feel good now!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_115,"All right then, I'm heading back. See you later, Cadet!"
d_ex_modernbar_09_116,She is utterly clueless that this was Rouge's intention all along.
d_ex_church_07_title,The God of Games
d_ex_church_07_1,"Rouge has predicted that today is going to be an unlucky day, so she's feeling really anxious."
d_ex_church_07_2,That's why I brought her to the Church.
d_ex_church_07_3,"I'm hoping that if we pray here, it might help her feel a little better."
d_ex_church_07_4,Mmmm...
d_ex_church_07_5,It's certainly nice and quiet in here.
d_ex_church_07_6,Do you feel better?
d_ex_church_07_7,"Yes, I think so."
d_ex_church_07_8,"I feel much calmer, somehow."
d_ex_church_07_9,I think I understand why some people turn to religion.
d_ex_church_07_10,I'm glad to hear that.
d_ex_church_07_11,...!
d_ex_church_07_12,M-my prayers have finally been heard!
d_ex_church_07_13,"Ahhh, thank you, thank you..."
d_ex_church_07_14,?
d_ex_church_07_15,?
d_ex_church_07_16,You've finally shown yourself to me...
d_ex_church_07_17,Maiden?
d_ex_church_07_18,What are you doing here?
d_ex_church_07_19,I was deep in prayer.
d_ex_church_07_20,What kind of prayer?
d_ex_church_07_21,To help me acquire the newly added legendary weapon.
d_ex_church_07_22,Everyone seems to have acquired it except me.
d_ex_church_07_23,Do you really think praying will make it happen?
d_ex_church_07_24,Of course.
d_ex_church_07_25,"As you can see, the God of Games herself is in front of me."
d_ex_church_07_26,God of Games?
d_ex_church_07_27,Who are you talking about...
d_ex_church_07_28,Hmm?
d_ex_church_07_29,"Are you not, Rouge, the God of Games?"
d_ex_church_07_30,I believe I've seen you on TV before.
d_ex_church_07_31,"I'm sorry, but I think you might be mistaken."
d_ex_church_07_32,I'm just a Game Master.
d_ex_church_07_33,It's the same thing.
d_ex_church_07_34,Do they not both have a similar meaning?
d_ex_church_07_35,Not at all.
d_ex_church_07_36,"Ahem, anyway."
d_ex_church_07_37,"Rouge, if you would,"
d_ex_church_07_38,please grant my wish.
d_ex_church_07_39,What? I...
d_ex_church_07_40,Can you not do it?
d_ex_church_07_41,I'm not a god.
d_ex_church_07_42,Y-you're not?
d_ex_church_07_43,"Say it isn't so... Ugh, the heavens have forsaken me..."
d_ex_church_07_44,Even though I prayed with such devotion.
d_ex_church_07_45,"... I may not be able to grant your wish, but I can take a look at your fortune for today."
d_ex_church_07_46,Would you like that?
d_ex_church_07_47,My fortune?
d_ex_church_07_48,Very well.
d_ex_church_07_49,It's better than nothing.
d_ex_church_07_50,*Swoosh*
d_ex_church_07_51,Rouge takes out a coin from her pocket.
d_ex_church_07_52,I'll test your luck.
d_ex_church_07_53,*Clink*
d_ex_church_07_54,"Rouge flips the coin, which flies into the air and lands back on her hand."
d_ex_church_07_55,*Tap*
d_ex_church_07_56,Heads or tails?
d_ex_church_07_57,"If you guess right,"
d_ex_church_07_58,today will be a lucky day for you.
d_ex_church_07_59,"If not, then it will be an unlucky day."
d_ex_church_07_60,"Now, choose."
d_ex_church_07_61,*Gulp*
d_ex_church_07_62,I-I'll go with heads!
d_ex_church_07_63,Heads!
d_ex_church_07_64,Very well. Let's see.
d_ex_church_07_65,Rouge slowly opens her hand.
d_ex_church_07_66,...
d_ex_church_07_67,!!
d_ex_church_07_68,!!
d_ex_church_07_69,It's heads.
d_ex_church_07_70,Does that mean I'll able to acquire the legendary weapon?
d_ex_church_07_71,I... I'm not sure about that.
d_ex_church_07_72,"Even if there is a success rate of 99%, there is still a 1% chance of failure."
d_ex_church_07_73,"Whoa! Thank you, Rouge!"
d_ex_church_07_74,I can finally acquire it!
d_ex_church_07_75,... I see you've perfected selective hearing.
d_ex_church_07_76,...
d_ex_church_07_77,*Ring*
d_ex_church_07_78,Are you going to do it right now?
d_ex_church_07_79,Of course!
d_ex_church_07_80,I had it turned on for a moment exactly like this.
d_ex_church_07_81,Maiden takes out her game and starts exploring the dungeon.
d_ex_church_07_82,That was fast.
d_ex_church_07_83,...
d_ex_church_07_84,...
d_ex_church_07_85,...
d_ex_church_07_86,Please...
d_ex_church_07_87,...?!
d_ex_church_07_88,!!!
d_ex_church_07_89,I-it...
d_ex_church_07_90,Yes?
d_ex_church_07_91,I-i-it appeared!
d_ex_church_07_92,"Congratulations, Maiden."
d_ex_church_07_93,Rouge!
d_ex_church_07_94,*Hug*
d_ex_church_07_95,Maiden tightly hugs Rouge.
d_ex_church_07_96,Thank you so much!
d_ex_church_07_97,You're definitely the God of Games!
d_ex_church_07_98,"Hehe, I'm not sure I'd go that far."
d_ex_church_07_99,All I did was read your fortune.
d_ex_church_07_100,You just happen to have good luck today.
d_ex_church_07_101,Now I don't have to worry whenever a new piece of equipment comes out!
d_ex_church_07_102,You'll be here to help me!
d_ex_church_07_103,... I can sense this conversation quickly turning south.
d_ex_church_07_104,I'll tell my other party members as well!
d_ex_church_07_105,Huh?
d_ex_church_07_106,Is it okay if we ask for your help in the future?
d_ex_church_07_107,Um... that might not be terribly convenient for me.
d_ex_church_07_108,"Oh no, Rouge."
d_ex_church_07_109,You must not deny your power.
d_ex_church_07_110,You proved it to me today!
d_ex_church_07_111,You proved your omnipotence as the God of Games!
d_ex_church_07_112,Did you not hear me when I said it was based on probability?
d_ex_church_07_113,You really should listen to what I'm trying to tell you...
d_ex_church_07_114,"Oh boy, everyone's gonna be so excited!"
d_ex_church_07_115,"After you read their fortunes, they'll all be able to acquire legendary weapons!"
d_ex_church_07_116,I'll visit you with my party members after the next patch.
d_ex_church_07_117,See you!
d_ex_church_07_118,"The Maiden speaks her mind and then just leaves, completely ignoring Rouge's words and reactions."
d_ex_church_07_119,...
d_ex_church_07_120,"Are you okay, Rouge?"
d_ex_church_07_121,It's at that moment that Rouge remembers
d_ex_church_07_122,today was meant to be an unlucky day for her.
d_ex_library_10_title,The Burrowing Rabbit and Rabbity
d_ex_library_10_1,*Gasp*
d_ex_library_10_2,Whew... I thought I was going to suffocate back there.
d_ex_library_10_3,Quency and I emerge from a small hole in the ground.
d_ex_library_10_4,"Hehe, shouldn't you be used to this by now?"
d_ex_library_10_5,Why even bother using a tunnel? I could just walk over here.
d_ex_library_10_6,"Why would you do that? We're both going to the same place, so why take different paths?"
d_ex_library_10_7,"If you're so against it, you should have said no."
d_ex_library_10_8,It's not that I'm entirely opposed to the idea...
d_ex_library_10_9,"Anyway, what kind of item were you asked to retrieve?"
d_ex_library_10_10,"We're in a library, aren't we?"
d_ex_library_10_11,"What else could it be? A book, of course."
d_ex_library_10_12,A convict from the Rehabilitation Center wants a book?
d_ex_library_10_13,Why wouldn't they? We're more cultured than you think!
d_ex_library_10_14,"Unfortunately, that's not the perception most people have of us, so that's why I've got this nifty plain clothes disguise on."
d_ex_library_10_15,"... But to be honest, I think there might be some important info or contraband inside this book they want."
d_ex_library_10_16,You look more like a thief than a regular citizen...
d_ex_library_10_17,"Bah, it's fine!"
d_ex_library_10_18,I'm wearing a mask. No one will know it's me.
d_ex_library_10_19,"Even if we do get caught, all we've gotta do is run away."
d_ex_library_10_20,"If that does happen, I trust that you'll be able to stay and smooth things over? Hehe."
d_ex_library_10_21,... So what's that book called?
d_ex_library_10_22,Encyclopedia of Rabbits on the Surface.
d_ex_library_10_23,"Apparently, they're picking a book they felt no one else would borrow."
d_ex_library_10_24,"After all, who in the world cares about rabbits up on the surface these days?"
d_ex_library_10_25,Yeah...
d_ex_library_10_26,Wow!
d_ex_library_10_27,?!
d_ex_library_10_28,?!
d_ex_library_10_29,I whip my head around
d_ex_library_10_30,"to see Alice standing beside us, book in hand. She darts her eyes back and forth between us and the book."
d_ex_library_10_31,Holy moly!
d_ex_library_10_32,H-how long have you been standing there?!
d_ex_library_10_33,Did you two... just come out of that hole?
d_ex_library_10_34,I saw it all!
d_ex_library_10_35,"Who's this that you're with, Rabbity?"
d_ex_library_10_36,Hmm... How do you think we should handle this?
d_ex_library_10_37,Beats me.
d_ex_library_10_38,You must be a rabbit digging your burrow!
d_ex_library_10_39,Huh?
d_ex_library_10_40,Come again?
d_ex_library_10_41,I just saw an entry in this here encyclopedia!
d_ex_library_10_42,Lots of rabbits live in tunnels that they dig called burrows.
d_ex_library_10_43,It's where they eat and sleep.
d_ex_library_10_44,Alice's eyes sparkle as she looks at Quency.
d_ex_library_10_45,I never thought I'd run into one in the library!
d_ex_library_10_46,Um...
d_ex_library_10_47,Yep! That's right. I'm a rabbit digging a burrow.
d_ex_library_10_48,You see? Hippity hop! Hehe.
d_ex_library_10_49,I knew it!
d_ex_library_10_50,"Hehe, nice to meet you, Burrowing Rabbit."
d_ex_library_10_51,"Alice, what's that book that you're holding?"
d_ex_library_10_52,Encyclopedia of Rabbits on the Surface.
d_ex_library_10_53,!!
d_ex_library_10_54,It has soooooo many rabbits!
d_ex_library_10_55,So the book we're looking for is right in front of us?
d_ex_library_10_56,Seems so.
d_ex_library_10_57,"Alice,"
d_ex_library_10_58,could I perhaps take a look at that encyclopedia?
d_ex_library_10_59,You're intrigued by it as well?
d_ex_library_10_60,Sure!
d_ex_library_10_61,*Thud*
d_ex_library_10_62,"Wow, very interesting."
d_ex_library_10_63,Thanks for letting me take a look.
d_ex_library_10_64,Huh? I don't think you read it all the way to the end.
d_ex_library_10_65,"Mhmm, that's right."
d_ex_library_10_66,"I'd love to read more, but since you're in the middle of reading it, I don't have much of a choice."
d_ex_library_10_67,"It's unfortunate, but I'll have to wait until next time to give it a proper read."
d_ex_library_10_68,Quency hands the encyclopedia back to Alice.
d_ex_library_10_69,"Oh, that's all right!"
d_ex_library_10_70,I already read it a bunch today.
d_ex_library_10_71,You can borrow it.
d_ex_library_10_72,Are you sure?
d_ex_library_10_73,"All right then, I'll return it the minute I'm finished with it."
d_ex_library_10_74,No problem! I can pick it back up once you're done.
d_ex_library_10_75,Alice gives the encyclopedia back to Quency.
d_ex_library_10_76,Smooth.
d_ex_library_10_77,"Hehe, thanks."
d_ex_library_10_78,"Well then, I've gotta get going."
d_ex_library_10_79,"See you later, Alice!"
d_ex_library_10_80,"Oh, Burrowing Rabbit!"
d_ex_library_10_81,Yes?
d_ex_library_10_82,Before you go... can I ask for one favor?
d_ex_library_10_83,What is it?
d_ex_library_10_84,Um... Could I...
d_ex_library_10_85,take a look at your burrow?
d_ex_library_10_86,You mean that hole we came through?
d_ex_library_10_87,Yeah!
d_ex_library_10_88,"I heard if you follow the paths inside, they can take you to all sorts of other places!"
d_ex_library_10_89,I'd love to go exploring in there!
d_ex_library_10_90,Oh?
d_ex_library_10_91,"Sorry, Alice, but I don't th..."
d_ex_library_10_92,Sure! That sounds like fun.
d_ex_library_10_93,Yahoo! Thank you!
d_ex_library_10_94,"I'll go in first. Follow me and stick close, okay?"
d_ex_library_10_95,Okay!
d_ex_library_10_96,Quency and Alice make their way to the tunnel opening.
d_ex_library_10_97,W-wait!
d_ex_library_10_98,?
d_ex_library_10_99,That might be a problem.
d_ex_library_10_100,Huh? So I can't go in?
d_ex_library_10_101,Well... I'm not saying that...
d_ex_library_10_102,B-but I want to see what's in there!
d_ex_library_10_103,"C'mon, Rabbity, don't be so mean!"
d_ex_library_10_104,It's just... all the rabbits in the burrow are sleeping right now.
d_ex_library_10_105,I don't think they'd appreciate you barging in unannounced like this.
d_ex_library_10_106,"Oh, is that so?"
d_ex_library_10_107,Then could you speak to them and invite me next time?
d_ex_library_10_108,Of course.
d_ex_library_10_109,"Hehe. Instructor, didn't you once say not to make promises you can't keep?"
d_ex_library_10_110,"If you keep fussing over every little thing like this, life can be awfully exhausting."
d_ex_library_10_111,Having other people join us might make things... complicated.
d_ex_library_10_112,Hm... I guess you're right.
d_ex_library_10_113,"All right then, I'll go first."
d_ex_library_10_114,*Swoosh*
d_ex_library_10_115,Quency disappears into the hole.
d_ex_library_10_116,Whoa!
d_ex_library_10_117,It's just as cool as it was the first time!
d_ex_library_10_118,"See you next time, Alice."
d_ex_library_10_119,"See you next time, Rabbity."
d_ex_library_10_120,"With a small pang of guilt, I jump into the hole."
d_ex_library_10_121,*Swoosh*
d_ex_library_10_122,I guess that's that...
d_ex_library_10_123,"Alice, now on her own, yells into the hole."
d_ex_library_10_124,Burrowing Rabbit!
d_ex_library_10_125,Be sure to invite me next time!
d_ex_library_10_126,I'll be waiting!
d_ex_modernbar_10_title,Suspicious Deal
d_ex_modernbar_10_01,*Jingle*
d_ex_modernbar_10_02,It's been a stressful day.
d_ex_modernbar_10_03,I just want to find a quiet corner where no one will notice me and have a drink in peace.
d_ex_modernbar_10_04,...?
d_ex_modernbar_10_05,"Off at the table in the furthest corner, I notice a familiar face."
d_ex_modernbar_10_06,Quency?
d_ex_modernbar_10_07,Shhh!
d_ex_modernbar_10_08,Keep your voice down!
d_ex_modernbar_10_09,Are you trying to announce my presence to the entire bar?
d_ex_modernbar_10_10,"Sorry. What are you doing here, anyway?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_11,I'm infiltrating the bar to make a deal.
d_ex_modernbar_10_12,"When it comes to these sneaky deals, there's no better place than a dimly lit bar."
d_ex_modernbar_10_13,Isn't your outfit a bit suspicious?
d_ex_modernbar_10_14,What are you talking about?
d_ex_modernbar_10_15,Don't you know anything about blending in?
d_ex_modernbar_10_16,This is leagues better than a prison jumpsuit.
d_ex_modernbar_10_17,Who are you doing business with?
d_ex_modernbar_10_18,"If you're so curious, why don't you stick around? They'll be here soon."
d_ex_modernbar_10_19,...
d_ex_modernbar_10_20,I think I'll take Quency up on her offer and wait around.
d_ex_modernbar_10_21,Soon after.
d_ex_modernbar_10_22,Is this the place?
d_ex_modernbar_10_23,There you are!
d_ex_modernbar_10_24,Nice to see you. I didn't expect to encounter such a high-profile criminal outside the Rehabilitation Center.
d_ex_modernbar_10_25,?
d_ex_modernbar_10_26,"What are you doing here with her, Client?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_27,I just happened to be passing by.
d_ex_modernbar_10_28,... All right. As long as you don't tell anyone about what you've seen.
d_ex_modernbar_10_29,"We don't have much time, so let's get straight to it."
d_ex_modernbar_10_30,Do you have the information?
d_ex_modernbar_10_31,Of course.
d_ex_modernbar_10_32,"I heard it inside the Rehabilitation Center with my own ears, so I can guarantee that it's reliable."
d_ex_modernbar_10_33,?
d_ex_modernbar_10_34,You don't have a recording or anything?
d_ex_modernbar_10_35,"No. What, don't you trust me?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_36,You know full well how much all the other prisoners
d_ex_modernbar_10_37,at the Rehabilitation Center trust yours truly.
d_ex_modernbar_10_38,... I'll give you that.
d_ex_modernbar_10_39,"All right then, out with it."
d_ex_modernbar_10_40,Let's see what's so shocking that
d_ex_modernbar_10_41,it has to be delivered verbally.
d_ex_modernbar_10_42,Okay.
d_ex_modernbar_10_43,Come closer.
d_ex_modernbar_10_44,Quency leans closer to Dora's ear and whispers.
d_ex_modernbar_10_45,...
d_ex_modernbar_10_46,...!
d_ex_modernbar_10_47,?!
d_ex_modernbar_10_48,Hehe. Waddya think about that?
d_ex_modernbar_10_49,If this is true... this is revelatory information.
d_ex_modernbar_10_50,So?
d_ex_modernbar_10_51,Did you bring what I asked for?
d_ex_modernbar_10_52,Absolutely.
d_ex_modernbar_10_53,*Thud*
d_ex_modernbar_10_54,Dolla places a heavy black bag on the table.
d_ex_modernbar_10_55,You can check it.
d_ex_modernbar_10_56,*Click*
d_ex_modernbar_10_57,Oooh!
d_ex_modernbar_10_58,You really did pack all that I asked for.
d_ex_modernbar_10_59,"Well, no matter how much we stuffed in there, this is still a profitable transaction for us."
d_ex_modernbar_10_60,"From where I am, I can't see the contents of the bag."
d_ex_modernbar_10_61,What's this information that's apparently so sensational?
d_ex_modernbar_10_62,"Sorry, Client. Even if it's you, I can't disclose that information."
d_ex_modernbar_10_63,The foundation of any business deal is trust.
d_ex_modernbar_10_64,Very nice! You're a reliable individual.
d_ex_modernbar_10_65,... Fine.
d_ex_modernbar_10_66,"Since the deal is complete, I'll be off."
d_ex_modernbar_10_67,See you around.
d_ex_modernbar_10_68,Bye.
d_ex_modernbar_10_69,"There wasn't anything shady about that deal, was there?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_70,Of course not. What do you take Dolla and me for?
d_ex_modernbar_10_71,"All right, that's a relief at least."
d_ex_modernbar_10_72,"Anyway, now that the deal is done,"
d_ex_modernbar_10_73,let's take this bag and get outta here.
d_ex_modernbar_10_74,Heroic ambush!
d_ex_modernbar_10_75,*Boooom*
d_ex_modernbar_10_76,Something comes plummeting towards us from up above at near supersonic speed.
d_ex_modernbar_10_77,Gah!
d_ex_modernbar_10_78,What is that?!
d_ex_modernbar_10_79,Hahahahaha!
d_ex_modernbar_10_80,Matis?! How did they know about this?
d_ex_modernbar_10_81,"Instructor, I've gotta hide! You take care of the bag, please!"
d_ex_modernbar_10_82,Quency rapidly ducks under the table and disappears into the shadows.
d_ex_modernbar_10_83,"A seedy bar, two shady individuals dressed in black, and a large bag being exchanged between them?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_84,"Clearly, some disreputable dealings are afoot!"
d_ex_modernbar_10_85,"Are you okay, Birdie?"
d_ex_modernbar_10_86,Where did those dastardly villains who kidnapped you go?
d_ex_modernbar_10_87,... They all ran off.
d_ex_modernbar_10_88,"Blast! Their clothing allowed them to blend into the surroundings, so I didn't get a proper look at their faces."
d_ex_modernbar_10_89,That sneaky swine!
d_ex_modernbar_10_90,Laplace approaches the large black bag that Quency left behind.
d_ex_modernbar_10_91,...!
d_ex_modernbar_10_92,It's quite heavy.
d_ex_modernbar_10_93,"Such is the weight of all the honest blood, sweat, and tears those villains have stolen from honest people."
d_ex_modernbar_10_94,I will return this to whomever it was no doubt stolen from.
d_ex_modernbar_10_95,*Click*
d_ex_modernbar_10_96,*Clattter*
d_ex_modernbar_10_97,Huh?
d_ex_modernbar_10_98,Bottle caps?
d_ex_modernbar_10_99,A cascade of bottle caps spills out from the black bag.
d_ex_modernbar_10_100,You really did pack all that I asked for.
d_ex_modernbar_10_101,"Well, no matter how much we stuffed in there, this is still a profitable transaction for us."
d_ex_modernbar_10_102,Birdie...
d_ex_modernbar_10_103,What is this?
d_ex_modernbar_10_104,"If they were villains, at least they were conscious about recycling."
d_ex_modernbar_10_105,A-ahem! I see!
d_ex_modernbar_10_106,I will not be defeated by this small setback!
d_ex_modernbar_10_107,Heroic bottle cap pickup!
d_ex_modernbar_10_108,Laplace bends down to pick up the bottle caps.
d_ex_modernbar_10_109,Eep!
d_ex_modernbar_10_110,Hmm? What was that sound?
d_ex_modernbar_10_111,Laplace moves towards the table to look under it.
d_ex_modernbar_10_112,!!
d_ex_modernbar_10_113,Aaaaaagh!
d_ex_modernbar_10_114,"What is it, Birdie?!"
d_ex_modernbar_10_115,I stepped on a bottle cap.
d_ex_modernbar_10_116,"Damn, those dastardly villains! This must have been part of their plan!"
d_ex_modernbar_10_117,This is an emergency! Someone is in danger!
d_ex_modernbar_10_118,Laplace picks me up and starts running.
d_ex_modernbar_10_119,...
d_ex_modernbar_10_120,Quency quietly puts the bottle caps back into the bag and slips into the darkness.
d_ex_powerplant_08_title,Escape King's Escape Lecture
d_ex_powerplant_08_1,Hello! I came here because I saw your flyer.
d_ex_powerplant_08_2,"Is it true that as long as I give you a bottle cap, I can listen to the escape lecture?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_3,You bet!
d_ex_powerplant_08_4,"Not a bad deal, wouldn't you say? Hehe."
d_ex_powerplant_08_5,It sure is!
d_ex_powerplant_08_6,But... I don't think I've seen you before.
d_ex_powerplant_08_7,Are you really as famous in this field as you say you are?
d_ex_powerplant_08_8,Infamous is more like it.
d_ex_powerplant_08_9,Instructor! You said you'd come here and vouch for me. How can you say that?
d_ex_powerplant_08_10,"Ahem. Anyway, while it's a bit embarrassing to say this myself,"
d_ex_powerplant_08_11,people call me the prison brea...
d_ex_powerplant_08_12,"Er... I mean, Escape King."
d_ex_powerplant_08_13,"Did I hear you say ""prison""?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_14,...
d_ex_powerplant_08_15,Uh... Ignore that. I misspoke.
d_ex_powerplant_08_16,"Since I'm a master escape artist, it'd stand to reason that I'd probably be good at prison breaks too, right?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_17,That's all I meant.
d_ex_powerplant_08_18,"After all, just take a look at my outfit."
d_ex_powerplant_08_19,"If you want to excel at escaping, you've got to wear tight-fitting clothes."
d_ex_powerplant_08_20,"Ah, I see!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_21,I wonder what kind of person could actually break out of that Rehabilitation Center?
d_ex_powerplant_08_22,That place really gives me the willies.
d_ex_powerplant_08_23,Who knows? They could be in our midst as we speak.
d_ex_powerplant_08_24,Huh? What was that?
d_ex_powerplant_08_25,Never mind.
d_ex_powerplant_08_26,"So,"
d_ex_powerplant_08_27,you want to learn about indoor escape techniques?
d_ex_powerplant_08_28,"Yes, that's right."
d_ex_powerplant_08_29,"I'm a survival expert myself, so I have some escape-related experience in the sense of fleeing from danger."
d_ex_powerplant_08_30,"I haven't done much of it indoors, though."
d_ex_powerplant_08_31,I see.
d_ex_powerplant_08_32,May I ask why you had us meet here?
d_ex_powerplant_08_33,I don't see what generators have to do with escaping.
d_ex_powerplant_08_34,"Oh, you don't?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_35,I beg to differ.
d_ex_powerplant_08_36,Do you see this upper part here?
d_ex_powerplant_08_37,*Whirrrrr*
d_ex_powerplant_08_38,I see a lot of vents.
d_ex_powerplant_08_39,That's right.
d_ex_powerplant_08_40,Those vents are meant to expel the heat generated from this contraption.
d_ex_powerplant_08_41,"So, are we going to...?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_42,"Hehe, that's right."
d_ex_powerplant_08_43,The classic way to escape from a sealed room is through a vent that leads outside.
d_ex_powerplant_08_44,"You're confident, right? You did say you were a pro."
d_ex_powerplant_08_45,"Yes, I am!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_46,"I've got survival techniques down pat for tight, confined spaces like this!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_47,"All right then, I might not have to hold your hand after all."
d_ex_powerplant_08_48,"Hehe, you're in for a treat!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_49,"All right then, let's practice."
d_ex_powerplant_08_50,You see that second vent from the left?
d_ex_powerplant_08_51,Yeah. It looks really narrow.
d_ex_powerplant_08_52,I came in here through that vent.
d_ex_powerplant_08_53,"Well then, before I teach you anything, how about you show me your skills first?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_54,Okay.
d_ex_powerplant_08_55,Tove heads toward the vent.
d_ex_powerplant_08_56,"First of all, to navigate through a narrow passage, it's super important to keep your mind in check."
d_ex_powerplant_08_57,"Since there's limited oxygen in constricted spaces,"
d_ex_powerplant_08_58,even Nikkes can end up feeling claustrophobic and panicked if they're not careful.
d_ex_powerplant_08_59,Very impressive. Your theoretical knowledge is sound.
d_ex_powerplant_08_60,She definitely sounds like an expert.
d_ex_powerplant_08_61,Whew...
d_ex_powerplant_08_62,"Therefore, you need to calm yourself by using deep breaths, like so."
d_ex_powerplant_08_63,"You crouch down to make yourself as small as possible, and then..."
d_ex_powerplant_08_64,Head in!
d_ex_powerplant_08_65,*Squeeze*
d_ex_powerplant_08_66,Huh?
d_ex_powerplant_08_67,I heard that's all you had to do...
d_ex_powerplant_08_68,"Well, what are you waiting for? Go in."
d_ex_powerplant_08_69,Er... I can't. The opening seems a bit too narrow.
d_ex_powerplant_08_70,...
d_ex_powerplant_08_71,"Hehe, let me show you how it's done."
d_ex_powerplant_08_72,Watch carefully.
d_ex_powerplant_08_73,When you need to enter a narrow opening like this...
d_ex_powerplant_08_74,Wheeew...
d_ex_powerplant_08_75,*Swoosh*
d_ex_powerplant_08_76,!!
d_ex_powerplant_08_77,"Quency quickly slips into the vent, which is far too small for her to fit through."
d_ex_powerplant_08_78,"Just let all the air out of your body for a moment, and you'll slip right through the opening. Once you're inside, you'll see it's actually more spacious than you'd expect!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_79,"Pretty easy, huh? Hehe."
d_ex_powerplant_08_80,Wow...
d_ex_powerplant_08_81,I'll give it a try.
d_ex_powerplant_08_82,Wheeew...
d_ex_powerplant_08_83,*Swoosh*
d_ex_powerplant_08_84,Wow!
d_ex_powerplant_08_85,I did it!
d_ex_powerplant_08_86,See what I mean?
d_ex_powerplant_08_87,"Hehe, this teaching thing is pretty fun. Especially when you've got such receptive students."
d_ex_powerplant_08_88,"Please, continue."
d_ex_powerplant_08_89,Okie dokie.
d_ex_powerplant_08_90,"Quency continues with her lecture,"
d_ex_powerplant_08_91,"and before long, Tove is able to move freely through the ventilation system."
d_ex_powerplant_08_92,"Wow, you've really come a long way!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_93,"Hehe, it's all thanks to you!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_94,I feel so proud! Is this what it's like to be a teacher?
d_ex_powerplant_08_95,*Beep beep beep*
d_ex_powerplant_08_96,!!
d_ex_powerplant_08_97,!!
d_ex_powerplant_08_98,Someone's coming.
d_ex_powerplant_08_99,"All right, survival expert! Ready for the real deal?"
d_ex_powerplant_08_100,"This time, we're heading outside the building."
d_ex_powerplant_08_101,Wait...
d_ex_powerplant_08_102,All right!
d_ex_powerplant_08_103,"I'll be right back, Survivalist!"
d_ex_powerplant_08_104,But how am I going to...
d_ex_powerplant_08_105,"I'll be timing you, so let's go as fast as we can."
d_ex_powerplant_08_106,All right!
d_ex_powerplant_08_107,*Swoosh*
d_ex_powerplant_08_108,*Swoosh*
d_ex_powerplant_08_109,"Before I have a chance to finish my appeal, both Tove and Quency disappear into the vent."
d_ex_powerplant_08_110,*Zing*
d_ex_powerplant_08_111,Ahhhh.
d_ex_powerplant_08_112,"I do love a good, filling lunch."
d_ex_powerplant_08_113,Huh? Cutey?
d_ex_powerplant_08_114,What are you doing here all by yourself?
d_ex_powerplant_08_115,I... er... I came to ask you something.
d_ex_powerplant_08_116,Oh? That's a first.
d_ex_powerplant_08_117,What is it? Ask away.
d_ex_powerplant_08_118,"Tove and Quency end up never returning,"
d_ex_powerplant_08_119,and now I find myself grappling with how to come up with science questions for Maxwell—questions I have absolutely no interest in.
d_ex_theater_10_title,Dream Chasers
d_ex_theater_10_1,"Today, I receive a message from Phantom."
d_ex_theater_10_2,"She says the sequel to Pirates of the Caspian is out, and she wants to watch it with me."
d_ex_theater_10_3,Why are you so interested in a pirate film all of a sudden?
d_ex_theater_10_4,I heard that
d_ex_theater_10_5,the main antagonist is a phantom thief.
d_ex_theater_10_6,How could I possibly let such an opportunity slip by?
d_ex_theater_10_7,It does sound like a good chance to see a phantom thief on screen.
d_ex_theater_10_8,Sssshhh!
d_ex_theater_10_9,The movie's starting.
d_ex_theater_10_10,The plot mainly revolves around the feud between the Pirate Jack Lowe and a mysterious phantom thief who is trying to steal his treasure.
d_ex_theater_10_11,"As the movie comes to a close, the lights in the theater come back on."
d_ex_theater_10_12,...
d_ex_theater_10_13,What did you think?
d_ex_theater_10_14,Pretty... pretty...
d_ex_theater_10_15,Pretty good.
d_ex_theater_10_16,How did you find it?
d_ex_theater_10_17,I thought it was fun.
d_ex_theater_10_18,I knew you'd say that.
d_ex_theater_10_19,"Even though he wasn't able to steal the pirate's treasure in the end,"
d_ex_theater_10_20,the phantom thief always held fast to his convictions and his pride.
d_ex_theater_10_21,The filmmakers did a wonderful job conveying that to the audience.
d_ex_theater_10_22,Nice!
d_ex_theater_10_23,Another splendid victory for Jack.
d_ex_theater_10_24,"Wasn't that a great ending, Morgan?"
d_ex_theater_10_25,??
d_ex_theater_10_26,?
d_ex_theater_10_27,"As I turn my head, I see Mast sitting in a seat just beside us."
d_ex_theater_10_28,How about that climax?
d_ex_theater_10_29,"The Phantom Thief was about to get their grubby mitts on the treasure, but Jack already had his hand on his gun."
d_ex_theater_10_30,"""Don't you move a muscle, Phantom Thief."""
d_ex_theater_10_31,"Oh boy, the sight of that dastardly villain frozen in fear! Hehe!"
d_ex_theater_10_32,Ahem.
d_ex_theater_10_33,Hmm?
d_ex_theater_10_34,Captain? Phantom?
d_ex_theater_10_35,You guys saw the movie too?
d_ex_theater_10_36,Yeah.
d_ex_theater_10_37,"Did you get caught up in all the pirate romance and adventure, too?"
d_ex_theater_10_38,"I bet your heart was racing, wasn't it?"
d_ex_theater_10_39,"It was indeed a good movie,"
d_ex_theater_10_40,but I have something I wish to ask you.
d_ex_theater_10_41,Huh? Me?
d_ex_theater_10_42,Yes. Do you really feel that the phantom thief lost?
d_ex_theater_10_43,Of course!
d_ex_theater_10_44,"The treasure ended up in Jack's hands in the end, didn't it?"
d_ex_theater_10_45,That means nothing.
d_ex_theater_10_46,"The phantom thief let him get the treasure, and showed him mercy so that Jack could come to his own realization later on."
d_ex_theater_10_47,?
d_ex_theater_10_48,So...
d_ex_theater_10_49,Are you saying that the thief went easy on Jack?
d_ex_theater_10_50,That's precisely what I'm saying.
d_ex_theater_10_51,What is this slander?!
d_ex_theater_10_52,You take that back!
d_ex_theater_10_53,"If anyone here deserves an apology, it's me."
d_ex_theater_10_54,...
d_ex_theater_10_55,Why would you side with a thief?
d_ex_theater_10_56,They abscond with other people's possessions.
d_ex_theater_10_57,They're no different from a common criminal!
d_ex_theater_10_58,...!!
d_ex_theater_10_59,They only steal from wrongdoers!
d_ex_theater_10_60,"If you ask me, pirates are far worse."
d_ex_theater_10_61,Don't they do plenty of their own plundering and harming of innocents?
d_ex_theater_10_62,Captain Jack isn't like that!
d_ex_theater_10_63,Well the phantom thief isn't like that either!
d_ex_theater_10_64,Is this really something worth getting riled up over?
d_ex_theater_10_65,...
d_ex_theater_10_66,...
d_ex_theater_10_67,"Fine, how about we have Monsieur come in as a neutral third party?"
d_ex_theater_10_68,He can tell us who in the movie came out on top.
d_ex_theater_10_69,Fine!
d_ex_theater_10_70,"Go on, Captain."
d_ex_theater_10_71,Tell her that the great pirate Captain Jack was victorious.
d_ex_theater_10_72,...
d_ex_theater_10_73,"If you're going based on the ending alone, that's technically true."
d_ex_theater_10_74,Haha! You see?
d_ex_theater_10_75,Wha...?! Are you serious?
d_ex_theater_10_76,"However, there were several points where the phantom thief guided Jack along so he wouldn't lose his way."
d_ex_theater_10_77,"If the phantom thief had not been there, would Jack have made the right choice?"
d_ex_theater_10_78,...!
d_ex_theater_10_79,I... I guess that's true.
d_ex_theater_10_80,I think Jack and the phantom thief share a lot of similarities.
d_ex_theater_10_81,They both value freedom and punish the wicked.
d_ex_theater_10_82,"They're both striving to achieve their dreams, so I don't see any need to bicker like this."
d_ex_theater_10_83,Their own dreams...
d_ex_theater_10_84,... Indeed.
d_ex_theater_10_85,...
d_ex_theater_10_86,Hmm...
d_ex_theater_10_87,"I'm sorry, Phantom."
d_ex_theater_10_88,I guess I got a bit excited and didn't consider anyone else's opinion.
d_ex_theater_10_89,I should apologize as well.
d_ex_theater_10_90,I was too worked up and said some harsh things.
d_ex_theater_10_91,Pirates and phantom thieves really are alike.
d_ex_theater_10_92,"Heh, I think so. You opened up my eyes. Thanks, Monsieur."
d_ex_theater_10_93,"... But I do have something to ask you, Phantom."
d_ex_theater_10_94,Go ahead.
d_ex_theater_10_95,Do you want to become a thief?
d_ex_theater_10_96,...!?
d_ex_theater_10_97,Wh-wha...
d_ex_theater_10_98,What do you mean?
d_ex_theater_10_99,"This entire time, you've been arguing in favor of the phantom thief."
d_ex_theater_10_100,"So, much like I dream of being a pirate, I was wondering if you..."
d_ex_theater_10_101,I want nothing to do with being a phantom thief!
d_ex_theater_10_102,?
d_ex_theater_10_103,D-don't get me wrong!
d_ex_theater_10_104,"Of course, I do like phantom thieves,"
d_ex_theater_10_105,but to accuse me of wanting to be one myself?
d_ex_theater_10_106,"However, if a phantom thief did actually exist, I would love to see them in person, at least once!"
d_ex_theater_10_107,Phantom!
d_ex_theater_10_108,?!
d_ex_theater_10_109,You don't need to try to hide it from me!
d_ex_theater_10_110,Re-really?
d_ex_theater_10_111,Can I trust you with this secret?
d_ex_theater_10_112,"Of course, you can!"
d_ex_theater_10_113,Didn't the Captain just say that pirates and phantom thieves are alike?
d_ex_theater_10_114,"Just like Jack and the phantom thief, both of us are striving to accomplish our dreams."
d_ex_theater_10_115,Haha.
d_ex_theater_10_116,"... After much back and forth, it seems a temporary truce has been reached."

d_ex_observationpost_09_1,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_09_2,Hmm...
d_ex_observationpost_09_3,Seems like no one's here.
d_ex_observationpost_09_4,Didn't you say Signal would be here?
d_ex_observationpost_09_5,She's usually here around this time of day.
d_ex_observationpost_09_6,Shall we wait for a while?
d_ex_observationpost_09_7,Hmm...
d_ex_observationpost_09_8,Okay.
d_ex_observationpost_09_9,Is it really normal to seek people out directly when they have overdue library books?
d_ex_observationpost_09_10,Not really.
d_ex_observationpost_09_11,"If we had to run around all the time collecting overdue library books in person, it'd be a real hassle."
d_ex_observationpost_09_12,This is a special case.
d_ex_observationpost_09_13,How so?
d_ex_observationpost_09_14,Because...
d_ex_observationpost_09_15,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_09_16,*Sob*
d_ex_observationpost_09_17,What a touching story...
d_ex_observationpost_09_18,Gah!
d_ex_observationpost_09_19,C-Commander?
d_ex_observationpost_09_20,Phantom?
d_ex_observationpost_09_21,When did you two get here?
d_ex_observationpost_09_22,Just now.
d_ex_observationpost_09_23,Shouldn't you be working right now? Where were you?
d_ex_observationpost_09_24,Uh... I...
d_ex_observationpost_09_25,J-just went to the bathroom.
d_ex_observationpost_09_26,Why does it look like
d_ex_observationpost_09_27,you've been crying?
d_ex_observationpost_09_28,...!
d_ex_observationpost_09_29,"I, um..."
d_ex_observationpost_09_30,"I was just looking at something, and..."
d_ex_observationpost_09_31,"Anyway, what are you two doing here?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_32,Ahem!
d_ex_observationpost_09_33,We have come on a very important matter.
d_ex_observationpost_09_34,The book you borrowed has been overdue for nearly 5 hours.
d_ex_observationpost_09_35,Oh my gosh!
d_ex_observationpost_09_36,It's due today?
d_ex_observationpost_09_37,I'm so sorry.
d_ex_observationpost_09_38,I'll return it immediately.
d_ex_observationpost_09_39,It's all right.
d_ex_observationpost_09_40,I came here to let you know we've granted you an extension.
d_ex_observationpost_09_41,You have?
d_ex_observationpost_09_42,"However, there is a condition."
d_ex_observationpost_09_43,Have you finished reading it?
d_ex_observationpost_09_44,"Oh, yes..."
d_ex_observationpost_09_45,I just finished it.
d_ex_observationpost_09_46,"You were reading the book just now, weren't you?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_47,!!
d_ex_observationpost_09_48,"I... I got so caught up in it, that I didn't realize how much time had passed."
d_ex_observationpost_09_49,S-sorry...
d_ex_observationpost_09_50,What do you think...
d_ex_observationpost_09_51,"about the book, that is."
d_ex_observationpost_09_52,Wh-what do I think?
d_ex_observationpost_09_53,That's right.
d_ex_observationpost_09_54,That book you borrowed is
d_ex_observationpost_09_55,"none other than Confessions of a Phantom Thief, a true masterpiece!"
d_ex_observationpost_09_56,One can hardly blame you for losing all sense of time while immersed in its pages.
d_ex_observationpost_09_57,"So tell me, which part did you find most captivating?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_58,Let me see...
d_ex_observationpost_09_59,I liked the final scene the best.
d_ex_observationpost_09_60,It really struck a chord with me.
d_ex_observationpost_09_61,Oh!
d_ex_observationpost_09_62,I second that!
d_ex_observationpost_09_63,"It's so thrilling and nerve-wracking, isn't it?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_64,T-totally!
d_ex_observationpost_09_65,I thought my heart was going to burst from my chest!
d_ex_observationpost_09_66,Me too!
d_ex_observationpost_09_67,The part where the phantom thief raids that final location is incredible!
d_ex_observationpost_09_68,The part where the phantom thief reveals their identity and confesses everything is remarkable!
d_ex_observationpost_09_69,Huh?
d_ex_observationpost_09_70,Huh?
d_ex_observationpost_09_71,Are we talking about the same book?
d_ex_observationpost_09_72,I... think so?
d_ex_observationpost_09_73,The scene I was talking about was after the phantom thief made his move at the final location.
d_ex_observationpost_09_74,... Was that in the book?
d_ex_observationpost_09_75,"I've read it over ten times, but I don't remember any scene like that..."
d_ex_observationpost_09_76,Really?
d_ex_observationpost_09_77,But the finale is the most exciting part of the entire book though.
d_ex_observationpost_09_78,"Signal, you usually prefer TV shows, right?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_79,What made you decide to borrow a book this time?
d_ex_observationpost_09_80,Ah...
d_ex_observationpost_09_81,"I recently saw a web drama that I really enjoyed, called I'll Steal Your Heart."
d_ex_observationpost_09_82,"It's apparently based on this book, and since I was curious,"
d_ex_observationpost_09_83,I decided to give it a read.
d_ex_observationpost_09_84,"Although they made a lot of changes while adapting it for the screen,"
d_ex_observationpost_09_85,the finale was the same in both.
d_ex_observationpost_09_86,It was so beautiful that it brought me to tears.
d_ex_observationpost_09_87,I see.
d_ex_observationpost_09_88,!!
d_ex_observationpost_09_89,Hold on.
d_ex_observationpost_09_90,So you're saying... it wasn't the phantom thief that drew you in?
d_ex_observationpost_09_91,...
d_ex_observationpost_09_92,"Anyway, if you like this book,"
d_ex_observationpost_09_93,I recommend that you check out the show.
d_ex_observationpost_09_94,No!
d_ex_observationpost_09_95,Give me that book back now!
d_ex_observationpost_09_96,??
d_ex_observationpost_09_97,O-okay. Here.
d_ex_observationpost_09_98,Let's see here.
d_ex_observationpost_09_99,...
d_ex_observationpost_09_100,What the...
d_ex_observationpost_09_101,Confessions of a Phantom Thief isn't a romance novel!
d_ex_observationpost_09_102,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_09_103,Uh...
d_ex_observationpost_09_104,"Did I say something I shouldn't have, Commander?"
d_ex_observationpost_09_105,"Nah, don't worry about it."
d_ex_observationpost_09_106,"I'll see you next time, Signal."
d_ex_observationpost_09_107,I follow Phantom out of the Observatory.
d_ex_observationpost_09_108,"For a while, I have to extol the virtues of the phantom thief in order to cheer up the disconsolate Phantom."

d_ex_clothingstore_10_6,Someone falls from the ceiling.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_7,?!

d_ex_clothingstore_10_9,I didn't expect that...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_10,Phantom?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_11,Are you...?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_12,?!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_13,Phantom hastily checks if her mask is still on her face.

d_ex_clothingstore_10_15,A-ahem! It's been a while.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_16,The phantom thief has arrived!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_17,"... It has been a while, Phantom Thief."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_18,What are you doing here?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_19,I could ask you the same thing.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_20,I came here to meet someone.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_21,You did?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_22,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_23,Are you perhaps here to meet the owner of this establishment?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_24,Yep.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_25,...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_26,"What are you doing here, Phantom?"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_27,"If you and the owner know each other, I can't tell you."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_28,"You're not here to steal anything, are you?"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_29,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_30,H-how did you know?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_31,Are you in cahoots with the villain
d_ex_clothingstore_10_32,who owns this place?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_33,Villian? The owner of this place is a villain?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_34,That's right.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_35,They're a very evil person indeed.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_36,"They steal precious and cherished items from the weak,"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_37,then hide them in their clothing store.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_38,This clothing store?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_39,That's right.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_40,Is this person you're speaking of a Nikke?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_41,??
d_ex_clothingstore_10_42,"No, they're human."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_43,... Phantom. Do you realize where we are?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_44,Of course!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_45,We're in the Outpos...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_46,?!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_47,We both know there's no way a human would set up shop here.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_48,Y-you're right.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_49,My mistake.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_50,It's just that this place has a strong resemblance to the clothing store I'm thinking of.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_51,"Darn, I need to..."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_52,*Ring*
d_ex_clothingstore_10_53,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_54,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_55,Huh? Rabbity?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_56,"... Hello, Alice."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_57,Hey!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_58,What are you doing here?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_59,...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_60,And who's this?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_61,I'm...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_62,A friend who is getting ready for a masquerade ball.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_63,Wha...?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_64,"Ooh, a masquerade? Sounds cool!"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_65,...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_66,I was wondering what was up with that nifty mask you're wearing.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_67,That explains it!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_68,"Er... yes, that's right."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_69,... You think this mask is cool?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_70,Oh yeah! It's amazing!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_71,Did you make it yourself?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_72,"... Yes, I did."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_73,What should I call it?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_74,Um...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_75,You... you can call it a Phantom Thief mask.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_76,A Phantom Thief mask?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_77,So can I call you Miss Phantom Thief Mask?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_78,... Sure.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_79,But you can't tell anyone else about this.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_80,??
d_ex_clothingstore_10_81,Why not?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_82,Why would you want to keep something so amazing a secret?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_83,Um...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_84,Precisely because it's so amazing!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_85,Huh?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_86,"That's right. Since phantom thieves are so cool,"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_87,"if other people knew about it, everyone would want to wear masks like this."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_88,That's why I'm keeping it a secret.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_89,...
d_ex_clothingstore_10_90,I see!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_91,You've got to keep it under wraps precisely because it's so cool.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_92,Exactly.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_93,So will you keep it a secret?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_94,"Sure, hehe!"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_95,"Your secret is safe with me, Miss Phantom Thief Mask!"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_96,... Much appreciated.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_97,Uh... Miss Phantom Thief Mask!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_98,Can I go to the masquerade ball too?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_99,I wanna wear a cool mask like yours and hang out with you!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_100,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_101,"I'm sorry, but I don't think that's possible."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_102,You need an invitation to attend.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_103,I can't go with someone who wasn't invited.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_104,Oh... I see.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_105,That's too bad.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_106,"Next time, perhaps."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_107,I'll come back and host a masquerade of my own.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_108,We can go together then.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_109,Really?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_110,Promise.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_111,Hehe. Okay!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_112,We'll go together!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_113,"Sounds like a plan. Well, I better get going."
d_ex_clothingstore_10_114,See you next time.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_115,Take care.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_116,Take care!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_117,Phantom jumps back up to the ceiling.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_118,"Wow, did you see that, Rabbity? She disappeared straight into the ceiling!"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_119,She really is a phantom thief!
d_ex_clothingstore_10_120,"... She certainly does seem that way, doesn't she?"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_121,"I wanna make a mask of my own,"
d_ex_clothingstore_10_122,so I can join her next time I see her.
d_ex_clothingstore_10_123,Would you like to join?
d_ex_clothingstore_10_124,Sure. Let's go make some masks together.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_title,Flexibility Contest
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_1,"It's this way, Gym Rat."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_2,"Rumani, what's this about?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_3,You specifically asked me to come.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_4,"The thing is I'm planning to hold an event in the Ark,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_5,so I wanted to test whether I'd set up everything properly before it starts.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_6,I invited a few others as well. I wonder where they are?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_7,An event?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_8,*Rustle* *Rustle*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_9,"Out of nowhere, I hear a rustling above the tree."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_10,"Then, something drops right in front of us."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_11,!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_12,Meow.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_13,There you are.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_14,I got here earlier and climbed up the tree for a nap.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_15,"Oh, I see."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_16,"Thanks for coming, Nero."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_17,You're welcome.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_18,"Is it just the three of us, or are there more coming?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_19,We should have one more arriving shortly.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_20,"And right then, the manhole cover on the ground starts to lift."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_21,Quency emerges from the opening while wriggling her body.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_22,"Oh, hey! I didn't know you'd be here, Instructor!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_23,"And, um... Hi, everyone!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_24,Quency? What are you doing here?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_25,I asked her to come.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_26,"By chance, I saw her emerging from a tunnel she'd dug, and her movements made it clear she was no ordinary person."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_27,Movements? What does that have to do with anything?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_28,Allow me to explain.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_29,Today's event is...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_30,a flexibility contest.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_31,!?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_32,Flexibility?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_33,I'm starting to see why you invited me!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_34,Quency nimbly maneuvers her way through confined spaces on a daily basis.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_35,"I'm not exactly sure what's happening,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_36,but consider me intrigued.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_37,Nero is so incredibly flexible that you'd almost think she's liquid.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_38,"Pre-workout stretching is imperative, no matter what kind of exercise you're doing."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_39,I thought inviting you all here would make for a good challenge.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_40,"Rumani is probably the most flexible of us all, thanks to the stretching she does before her workouts."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_41,Does this mean...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_42,... Am I supposed to be joining in as well?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_43,No.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_44,Your role is to observe and judge which of us is the most flexible.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_45,"Here's the schedule we'll be following, so please make sure to follow it in order."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_46,Phew... That's a relief.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_47,"So, what does the winner get?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_48,I'm wondering that myself.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_49,"When you invited us, you said there'd be a big prize."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_50,"Oh, it's going to be something amazing, for sure!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_51,You'll get unlimited gym access for an entire year!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_52,... Not interested.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_53,Me neither.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_54,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_55,"Then, what do you want?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_56,Bottle caps!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_57,Catnip or snacks would be nice.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_58,*Sigh*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_59,"They don't exactly have much to do with exercise, but fine."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_60,I'll make an exception.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_61,Awesome! I'm suddenly so pumped up!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_62,Same here!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_63,"And with that, the flexibility contest begins."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_64,"First up, we have the splits."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_65,Meow.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_66,Hyah!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_67,Hmph.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_68,Whoa!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_69,All three of them effortlessly execute a perfect split.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_70,"Next, keep your upper body and face on the ground while raising your hips into the air and resting the soles of your feet on your head."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_71,What in the world is this pose?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_72,It's a yoga pose called the Scorpion.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_73,One which requires significant pliability and strength.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_74,I doubt either of these two will be able to—
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_75,!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_76,"Before Rumani has even finished her sentence, Nero and Quency have already gotten into perfect Scorpion poses with completely calm expressions."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_77,Wow...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_78,Drats... Looks like I picked some stiff competition.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_79,"All right. Let's continue, Gym Rat."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_80,Sure thing.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_81,"Although the poses get progressively more challenging, all three Nikkes manage to pull them off with ease."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_82,"As the competition drags on and I start to feel exhausted, all that remains is the final challenge."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_83,The last challenge is the limbo.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_84,The bar will be set at 30 centimeters.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_85,You must bend backwards and pass under the bar without touching it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_86,"Seriously? This is so unfair for someone with my physical ""gifts""!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_87,Meow.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_88,Pfft...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_89,"Since I'll probably fail anyway, I'll go first."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_90,Quency steps forward and carefully bends backward.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_91,"With her body practically lying on the ground, she attempts to pass beneath the bar, but..."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_92,*Bump*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_93,Dang it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_94,Just as I thought!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_95,There's no way I can do 30 centimeters with my body shape!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_96,"But hey, rules are rules, so I'll throw in the towel."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_97,"All right, Quency is eliminated!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_98,I'll give it a go next.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_99,"Nero leans back, smoothly passes under the bar like water."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_100,Nicely done.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_101,!!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_102,Nero is almost all the way through when...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_103,*Bump*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_104,Meow?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_105,Why'd the bar move?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_106,Uh... Your tail hit it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_107,Meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_108,You've got to be kidding me.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_109,"My catnip and snacks... gone, just like that."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_110,Nero is out as well!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_111,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_112,It's my turn.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_113,Whew...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_114,"All right, I'll give it a shot!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_115,"Considering two of us are already out, you might as well win."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_116,Meow.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_117,Hmph...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_118,"Rumani calmly arched her body,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_119,then starts to inch forward using her strong core and impressive flexibility.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_120,Phew... Unghh...!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_121,*Bump*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_122,*Thud*
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_123,Darn.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_124,I failed too...
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_125,Rumani is out as well.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_126,... No one won?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_127,Seems so.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_128,I'll have to focus more on my stretching for a while.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_129,"I may have lost,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_130,but experiencing the event firsthand has been incredibly useful.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_131,"Thank you, Nero and Quency, for your help."
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_132,I'll give you the items you mentioned earlier as gifts.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_133,What? Really?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_134,Are you serious?
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_135,Consider it a participation prize.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_136,Just do me a favor and participate when the event takes place at the Ark.
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_137,Of course!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_138,Meow! Meow meow!
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_139,"The prize for the actual event will indeed be a free gym membership for a year,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_08_140,a fact that Nero and Quency seem blissfully unaware of as they look forward to the next event.
d_ex_powerplant_09_title,Friendship-Destroying Exercise
d_ex_powerplant_09_1,Is this where
d_ex_powerplant_09_2,everyone gathers to exercise?
d_ex_powerplant_09_3,I believe so.
d_ex_powerplant_09_4,I see.
d_ex_powerplant_09_5,Let's see... who's here...
d_ex_powerplant_09_6,*Gasp*!
d_ex_powerplant_09_7,Wh-who's there?!
d_ex_powerplant_09_8,Huh?
d_ex_powerplant_09_9,Mr. Commander?
d_ex_powerplant_09_10,"And... is that you, Ms. Rumani?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_11,Howdy! What are you two doing here?
d_ex_powerplant_09_12,!!!
d_ex_powerplant_09_13,Trony looks around cautiously and then vanishes somewhere.
d_ex_powerplant_09_14,"Is there something that needs fixing,"
d_ex_powerplant_09_15,"or have you developed an interest in the world of BOOM too, Ms. Rumani?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_16,That's not it.
d_ex_powerplant_09_17,"I'm sure working in a place like this can make your muscles stiff,"
d_ex_powerplant_09_18,so I came to help.
d_ex_powerplant_09_19,Let's get you working up a sweat to loosen up your body!
d_ex_powerplant_09_20,Huh?
d_ex_powerplant_09_21,That's not true at all!
d_ex_powerplant_09_22,"Our work may look pretty sedentary,"
d_ex_powerplant_09_23,but we actually move around quite a bit.
d_ex_powerplant_09_24,Really?
d_ex_powerplant_09_25,Show me.
d_ex_powerplant_09_26,Come again?
d_ex_powerplant_09_27,Show me how you move around.
d_ex_powerplant_09_28,"If everything checks out, I'll head back and won't bother you anymore."
d_ex_powerplant_09_29,*Gulp*
d_ex_powerplant_09_30,M-Ms. Trony! Where are you hiding?
d_ex_powerplant_09_31,...
d_ex_powerplant_09_32,We were supposed to be a team! Ride or die! How could you betray me like this?
d_ex_powerplant_09_33,Fine.
d_ex_powerplant_09_34,Time to bust out the big guns.
d_ex_powerplant_09_35,"Help me out, would you, Mr. Commander?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_36,Huh? Me?
d_ex_powerplant_09_37,"Yeah, I can't beat this by myself."
d_ex_powerplant_09_38,This here is called...
d_ex_powerplant_09_39,BOOM VR that comes with full body tracking!
d_ex_powerplant_09_40,Elegg and I strap a plethora of gear onto our arms and legs.
d_ex_powerplant_09_41,"As I gaze at the images being shown in the visor, my legs suddenly begin to move automatically."
d_ex_powerplant_09_42,What the... What's going on?!
d_ex_powerplant_09_43,"Run, Mr. Commander! You don't want to die, do you?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_44,Gaaaaah!
d_ex_powerplant_09_45,What is this?
d_ex_powerplant_09_46,An exercise method using a game?
d_ex_powerplant_09_47,*Huff huff*
d_ex_powerplant_09_48,Those steps you're taking... it seems like you're dodging enemy attacks?
d_ex_powerplant_09_49,There's a variety of movements that keep you on your toes and engage your lower core muscles.
d_ex_powerplant_09_50,Ha! Hyahhhh!
d_ex_powerplant_09_51,Switching between attacking enemies and running is a wonderful balance between anaerobic and aerobic exercise.
d_ex_powerplant_09_52,I never thought it'd be possible to achieve all of this with a game.
d_ex_powerplant_09_53,*Bam* *Bam bam bam*
d_ex_powerplant_09_54,Phew... That's stage 1 cleared.
d_ex_powerplant_09_55,"What do... you think, Ms. Rumani?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_56,Sati... satisfied? Phew...
d_ex_powerplant_09_57,*Pant pant*
d_ex_powerplant_09_58,"Yeah, that was more than I expected."
d_ex_powerplant_09_59,And you do this daily?
d_ex_powerplant_09_60,!
d_ex_powerplant_09_61,You bet I do!
d_ex_powerplant_09_62,I can't go a day without BOOM!
d_ex_powerplant_09_63,"Very well then, you're a pass in my book."
d_ex_powerplant_09_64,"By the way, would you be interested in sharing that VR game you just played?"
d_ex_powerplant_09_65,"If possible, I would like to use it in our gym."
d_ex_powerplant_09_66,!!!
d_ex_powerplant_09_67,We can make that happen 100%! I'd love to outfit your gym with BOOM!
d_ex_powerplant_09_68,Thanks.
d_ex_powerplant_09_69,"Now, next up we have..."
d_ex_powerplant_09_70,Trony?
d_ex_powerplant_09_71,Eek!
d_ex_powerplant_09_72,"I know you're trying to hide, but I can still see you."
d_ex_powerplant_09_73,Why don't you come out now?
d_ex_powerplant_09_74,Uh...
d_ex_powerplant_09_75,I-I'm not feeling well today.
d_ex_powerplant_09_76,Could we maybe talk next time? Say... a year from now?
d_ex_powerplant_09_77,You don't feel well?
d_ex_powerplant_09_78,It's because of all the accumulated wear and tear on your body. Regular exercise can help you avoid that.
d_ex_powerplant_09_79,"Plus,"
d_ex_powerplant_09_80,spending most of your time on that table doesn't help either.
d_ex_powerplant_09_81,It's not what you think...
d_ex_powerplant_09_82,"Come on, Trony."
d_ex_powerplant_09_83,"If you don't have anything urgent going on today, I'll train you."
d_ex_powerplant_09_84,!
d_ex_powerplant_09_85,Er... I-I have a lot of important things to do today!
d_ex_powerplant_09_86,"It's okay, Ms. Trony."
d_ex_powerplant_09_87,I'll hold down the fort. You can go ahead.
d_ex_powerplant_09_88,Wha...?! Elegg... why?
d_ex_powerplant_09_89,Don't think I've forgotten
d_ex_powerplant_09_90,how you scurried off and left me to fend for myself.
d_ex_powerplant_09_91,Huff... puff...
d_ex_powerplant_09_92,W-wait!
d_ex_powerplant_09_93,Gaaaaah!
d_ex_powerplant_09_94,"Rumani eventually has to drag Trony out by force,"
d_ex_powerplant_09_95,while I rest until I can catch my breath before finally managing to leave the generator.
d_ex_gym_09_title,Nepenthe's Exercises
d_ex_gym_09_1,Is that everyone?
d_ex_gym_09_2,Yes.
d_ex_gym_09_3,"I think so… Ugh, it's so hot."
d_ex_gym_09_4,The reason I asked you all to gather here is simple.
d_ex_gym_09_5,I want each of us to show Gym Rat the appeal of our workouts.
d_ex_gym_09_6,Show Coach? Why?
d_ex_gym_09_7,It seems that his interest in exercise has decreased a lot lately.
d_ex_gym_09_8,So we should help him.
d_ex_gym_09_9,I don't think that's necessary...
d_ex_gym_09_10,"Oh no, it's quite necessary."
d_ex_gym_09_11,This is exactly the kind of situation that Nepenthe exists for.
d_ex_gym_09_12,"Having said that, I don't know everything there is to know about exercise."
d_ex_gym_09_13,"So while I always want to teach you more, there are times when I can't."
d_ex_gym_09_14,That's why I think it'd be invigorating for all of us to learn about different types of exercise.
d_ex_gym_09_15,... All right.
d_ex_gym_09_16,"Then, Epinel, if you would."
d_ex_gym_09_17,Okay.
d_ex_gym_09_18,"As you already know, Coach, I'm a big fan of skateboarding."
d_ex_gym_09_19,It's mainly an aerobic exercise that really boosts your stamina.
d_ex_gym_09_20,"It requires significant core strength to maintain your posture, and your lower body strength to keep your balance."
d_ex_gym_09_21,But the most important thing?
d_ex_gym_09_22,You can actually have fun while you're at it.
d_ex_gym_09_23,Epinel sets off on her board and does a quick lap around the gym.
d_ex_gym_09_24,Her joyous expression in the wind is so infectious that it puts a smile on everyone's faces.
d_ex_gym_09_25,Here's a tip:
d_ex_gym_09_26,Don't be afraid of falling down.
d_ex_gym_09_27,"That was an amazing introduction, Epinel."
d_ex_gym_09_28,That'd be enough to stoke anyone's interest in skateboarding.
d_ex_gym_09_29,"Yeah, that was great. I'm actually tempted to go skate on the board right away."
d_ex_gym_09_30,"Thanks, I appreciate that."
d_ex_gym_09_31,"Folkwang, you're next."
d_ex_gym_09_32,"Phew... Okay,"
d_ex_gym_09_33,so running is my go-to exercise.
d_ex_gym_09_34,"It's great for building strength, endurance, and even helps with stress,"
d_ex_gym_09_35,but you probably already know all that. So let me tell you what I love about it personally.
d_ex_gym_09_36,"Whenever I run and work up a sweat, the perspiration has a nice cooling effect on my skin."
d_ex_gym_09_37,"Plus, running clears my mind completely."
d_ex_gym_09_38,All those pesky thoughts about being too hot or sticky just vanish.
d_ex_gym_09_39,I absolutely live for that feeling… Whew…
d_ex_gym_09_40,"Oh, and don't forget to take some supplements too! About 20 capsules shou—"
d_ex_gym_09_41,Folkwang.
d_ex_gym_09_42,"... No, you should only take them in moderation."
d_ex_gym_09_43,That's better.
d_ex_gym_09_44,"That was a lovely introduction to running,"
d_ex_gym_09_45,excluding that last bit about the supplements.
d_ex_gym_09_46,My precious supplements...
d_ex_gym_09_47,I feel like going for a run right now while listening to my favorite song.
d_ex_gym_09_48,"Thanks for saying that, Coach."
d_ex_gym_09_49,"Now, it's my turn."
d_ex_gym_09_50,"I know that it can be hard to get excited about going to the gym,"
d_ex_gym_09_51,especially when it's compared to these other unique and novel exercise methods.
d_ex_gym_09_52,But!
d_ex_gym_09_53,There's nothing quite like a gym workout to put both my strength and endurance to the test all at once.
d_ex_gym_09_54,"The rush of flawlessly executing a set,"
d_ex_gym_09_55,"the sense of achievement when lifting more weight than the day before,"
d_ex_gym_09_56,and the joy of setting your own pace.
d_ex_gym_09_57,"That, to me, is the true definition of exercise."
d_ex_gym_09_58,"Folkwang, Epinel. What do you two think?"
d_ex_gym_09_59,Uh...
d_ex_gym_09_60,I... find it a bit tough to keep up with your pace.
d_ex_gym_09_61,That's precisely the point! That's when you overcome your limits.
d_ex_gym_09_62,It's so tough. I always sweat so much that it makes gripping the dumbbells and barbells really difficult...
d_ex_gym_09_63,That's why I made custom gloves and straps for you.
d_ex_gym_09_64,...
d_ex_gym_09_65,...
d_ex_gym_09_66,There's definitely a certain charm to working out at the gym... even if it is tough.
d_ex_gym_09_67,"Coach, what are you doing?!"
d_ex_gym_09_68,"If you say that, Rumani will—"
d_ex_gym_09_69,Huh? Did I say something wrong?
d_ex_gym_09_70,"I knew you'd agree with me, Gym Rat."
d_ex_gym_09_71,"How about we start with some skateboarding, follow it up with a run,"
d_ex_gym_09_72,and then wrap it up with a gym workout?
d_ex_gym_09_73,Wha... Why are we doing all three?
d_ex_gym_09_74,It seems like you're really interested in all three of our exercises.
d_ex_gym_09_75,"Once you show an interest in physical activity, it's best to jump straight into it."
d_ex_gym_09_76,... So we have to work out right now?
d_ex_gym_09_77,That's right.
d_ex_gym_09_78,"We'll be joining you, of course."
d_ex_gym_09_79,"That way, we can all motivate each other while we exercise."
d_ex_gym_09_80,...
d_ex_gym_09_81,...
d_ex_gym_09_82,...
d_ex_gym_09_83,Epinel! Are you ready to teach us how to skateboard?
d_ex_gym_09_84,I'll get a board for you.
d_ex_gym_09_85,... All right.
d_ex_gym_09_86,"For the rest of the day, we're held hostage by Rumani and forced to exercise continuously."
d_ex_gym_09_87,"By the time we reach the final workout at the gym, the intensity is enough to make me kick myself for speaking out earlier."
d_ex_hospital_09_title,The Little Ones
d_ex_hospital_09_1,"Oh hi,"
d_ex_hospital_09_2,Blossom.
d_ex_hospital_09_3,Commander?
d_ex_hospital_09_4,What brings you here?
d_ex_hospital_09_5,"I ran out of medicine, so I came to get some more."
d_ex_hospital_09_6,What are you two up to?
d_ex_hospital_09_7,It's about the little ones
d_ex_hospital_09_8,she's taking care of at the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_09_9,"Since you're here, Commander, would you mind listening for a bit?"
d_ex_hospital_09_10,"Sure, why not."
d_ex_hospital_09_11,I didn't realize there were little ones at the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_09_12,I'm surprised such a thing is allowed.
d_ex_hospital_09_13,Pardon?
d_ex_hospital_09_14,"Oh, yes."
d_ex_hospital_09_15,"There aren't many of them, but they're really cute kids."
d_ex_hospital_09_16,"Lately though, they do seem to be having a harder time with staying in the hospital."
d_ex_hospital_09_17,They're feeling pretty cooped up. Maybe because they're always stuck in their room.
d_ex_hospital_09_18,"After all, they can't go outside often."
d_ex_hospital_09_19,Hmm... I see.
d_ex_hospital_09_20,"If they can't go outside, that means they can't get any direct sunlight or fresh air."
d_ex_hospital_09_21,They'll gradually wither and lose their energy.
d_ex_hospital_09_22,"Yes, exactly."
d_ex_hospital_09_23,"They seem rather anxious, and some have even been reduced to tears."
d_ex_hospital_09_24,It breaks my heart to see them like that...
d_ex_hospital_09_25,Oh my goodness...
d_ex_hospital_09_26,It's always painful to see the little ones struggling.
d_ex_hospital_09_27,I get where you're coming from.
d_ex_hospital_09_28,"I wish I could find the time to take them outside, even for a little while."
d_ex_hospital_09_29,"But given the state they're in, it's not easy..."
d_ex_hospital_09_30,"But at the same time, it pains me to leave them as they are."
d_ex_hospital_09_31,I just want to see them smile again.
d_ex_hospital_09_32,Is there any way I can do that?
d_ex_hospital_09_33,How about playing with them?
d_ex_hospital_09_34,"Each child likes different activities,"
d_ex_hospital_09_35,so it's not that simple.
d_ex_hospital_09_36,"Also, some of them aren't well enough to join in."
d_ex_hospital_09_37,I see...
d_ex_hospital_09_38,"If I were you,"
d_ex_hospital_09_39,I'd start by checking if you're watering them enough.
d_ex_hospital_09_40,Huh?
d_ex_hospital_09_41,What?
d_ex_hospital_09_42,What was that about water?
d_ex_hospital_09_43,Water and nutrients.
d_ex_hospital_09_44,They're both incredibly important for children.
d_ex_hospital_09_45,"Oh... Yes, of course."
d_ex_hospital_09_46,They're vital for growing kids.
d_ex_hospital_09_47,"If they don't get their essential nutrients, the negative effects are quite pronounced."
d_ex_hospital_09_48,That's why it's important to check the temperature and humidity of their rooms.
d_ex_hospital_09_49,This is even more crucial due to the fact they're confined to being inside the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_09_50,A good environment is essential for them to grow up healthy.
d_ex_hospital_09_51,Temperature and humidity!
d_ex_hospital_09_52,It makes sense!
d_ex_hospital_09_53,"Now that I think about it, the hospital rooms do seem a bit dry."
d_ex_hospital_09_54,I should check it out.
d_ex_hospital_09_55,"Next, what's important is conversation."
d_ex_hospital_09_56,Conversation... Ah!
d_ex_hospital_09_57,You mean psychological counseling?
d_ex_hospital_09_58,"Yes, when each of you share your thoughts with each other, you'll reach a greater mutual understanding."
d_ex_hospital_09_59,You'll have a better insight into how they're feeling.
d_ex_hospital_09_60,"As Flora continues to give advice, Pepper begins to jot down notes on her tablet."
d_ex_hospital_09_61,You must always lavish them with love and attention.
d_ex_hospital_09_62,Little ones are very sensitive to their caregiver's reactions.
d_ex_hospital_09_63,"If they sense even a slight decrease in attention,"
d_ex_hospital_09_64,they will indeed become very sad and quite morose.
d_ex_hospital_09_65,Oh dear...
d_ex_hospital_09_66,"I've been rather busy lately, and so I haven't been able to see the children as often as I'd like."
d_ex_hospital_09_67,That might explain what's happening.
d_ex_hospital_09_68,I understand.
d_ex_hospital_09_69,"I know your other duties keep you busy, but"
d_ex_hospital_09_70,you must cherish the time you spend with the little ones.
d_ex_hospital_09_71,They look up to you.
d_ex_hospital_09_72,"Yes, I'll make sure to do that!"
d_ex_hospital_09_73,"As a matter of fact, I'll go see them right now!"
d_ex_hospital_09_74,Thank you both for listening to my rants.
d_ex_hospital_09_75,And for the wonderful advice too!
d_ex_hospital_09_76,See you next time!
d_ex_hospital_09_77,Pepper leaves with a beaming expression on her face.
d_ex_hospital_09_78,"Hehe, this makes me happy."
d_ex_hospital_09_79,I hope I'll have a chance one day to see the little ones at the hospital.
d_ex_hospital_09_80,I'm curious what kind they are.
d_ex_hospital_09_81,Hmm? What do you mean?
d_ex_hospital_09_82,"If the timing is right, we might even get to see them bloom."
d_ex_hospital_09_83,"When I do get to see them, would you like to come with me, Blossom?"
d_ex_hospital_09_84,Er...
d_ex_hospital_09_85,"The ""little ones"" that Flora has been mentioning this whole time... I think she was talking about..."
d_ex_hospital_09_86,Sure thing.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_title,First Maid Cafe Experience
d_ex_maidcafe_10_1,*Jingle*
d_ex_maidcafe_10_2,"Welcome back, Master."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_3,Hello.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_4,"The lady next to you is Miss Flora, right?"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_5,"Yes, that's correct."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_6,I heard this is your first time at a maid cafe?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_7,"Yes, it's my first time."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_8,Flora glances around the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_9,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_10,"At first glance, it doesn't seem much different from a regular cafe."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_11,Except for the staff
d_ex_maidcafe_10_12,"working in maid outfits, that is."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_13,"Other than that, what are the differences between this place and a regular cafe?"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_14,"Well, other than the outfits that you just mentioned,"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_15,"at our cafe, we tailor our service to suit the individual preferences of each Master who visits."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_16,We strive to provide an experience that will leave you feeling completely satisfied.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_17,I see.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_18,You've got me curious now.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_19,"We will do our utmost to meet your expectations, Miss."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_20,Please have a seat over here.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_21,"Flora and I sit down at the spot Ade guides us to, and look at the menu."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_22,"I'll have a coffee, please."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_23,Excellent.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_24,"And for you, Miss Flora?"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_25,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_26,You've got quite a lot of different tea options...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_27,Have you got plain water?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_28,"If you'd like some water, we can serve that free of charge."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_29,... Uh-huh.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_30,"I came all the way out here, so I might as well get more than water."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_31,I'll have a coffee as well.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_32,Excellent. I'll have those for you in just a moment.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_33,Ade heads to the kitchen.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_34,"Thanks for coming here with me, Blossom."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_35,"No problem. It's been a while since I've been here, so I was happy to tag along."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_36,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_37,Flora takes another look around the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_38,"Upon closer inspection,"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_39,this place does have quite a lovely atmosphere.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_40,"A lot of effort has gone into the decorations, both big and small."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_41,Especially... do you see that vase over there?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_42,"Yes, it's pretty."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_43,It's more than just pretty.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_44,The flowers that are placed inside go perfectly with the vase itself.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_45,The color combination is wonderfully harmonious.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_46,It's sublime.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_47,Whoever arranged them must really know their flowers.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_48,I can feel the affection they have for them.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_49,Here are your coffees.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_50,"Excuse me, Lily."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_51,May I ask
d_ex_maidcafe_10_52,who arranged that vase over there?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_53,I did.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_54,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_10_55,"You like flowers, don't you?"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_56,"Yes, I do."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_57,Looking at them soothes my mind.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_58,I placed them there in hopes that
d_ex_maidcafe_10_59,our customers would feel the same.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_60,I see...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_61,"I really like them, hehe."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_62,Hmm?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_63,Is this coffee?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_64,It looks different from Blossom's.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_65,Mine seems a bit lighter?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_66,"Oh, I'm sorry for not explaining sooner."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_67,"Yours isn't regular coffee, Miss."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_68,We've served you water infused with coffee grounds.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_69,I felt this would be more suitable to your tastes.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_70,... I see.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_71,The smell is quite mild. Very delicate.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_72,...
d_ex_maidcafe_10_73,*Gulp*
d_ex_maidcafe_10_74,!
d_ex_maidcafe_10_75,"Wow, it's so smooth."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_76,It's perfect.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_77,I'm glad you like it.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_78,"Moreover, the water has a balanced acidity, which can be beneficial for some plants as well."
d_ex_maidcafe_10_79,Really?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_80,Is that true?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_81,"Could you tell me how to make this? How long do I brew the coffee grounds, and how much of them?"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_82,Could you give me the exact amount and time measurements?
d_ex_maidcafe_10_83,Flora proceeds to bombard Ade with a flurry of questions.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_84,A few hours later.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_85,That was incredibly satisfying.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_86,The Maid Cafe truly is a wonderful place.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_87,"I'll definitely come back... No,"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_88,"I'll come often, Lily!"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_89,Thank you for stopping by.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_90,See you next time.
d_ex_maidcafe_10_91,"Clutching the bag of coffee grounds she received from Ade,"
d_ex_maidcafe_10_92,Flora leaves the Maid Cafe with a satisfied look on her face.
d_ex_shopping_10_title,The Floral Perfume Artisan
d_ex_shopping_10_1,Sweetie! You're just in time!
d_ex_shopping_10_2,*Psssh pssh*
d_ex_shopping_10_3,Rupee sprays some liquid from a small bottle onto a paper strip and hands it to me.
d_ex_shopping_10_4,Smell this.
d_ex_shopping_10_5,Tell me what you think.
d_ex_shopping_10_6,It's nice.
d_ex_shopping_10_7,"Come on, you've gotta give me more than that!"
d_ex_shopping_10_8,Tell me what it smells like!
d_ex_shopping_10_9,Uh... It's... fragrant?
d_ex_shopping_10_10,"Ugh. No, this just won't do."
d_ex_shopping_10_11,"Excuse me, ma'am?"
d_ex_shopping_10_12,I think this scent would be perfect for you. Are you interested?
d_ex_shopping_10_13,Hold on... I feel like I've done this somewhere before...
d_ex_shopping_10_14,Talk about déjà vu...
d_ex_shopping_10_15,Hmm? Were you talking to me?
d_ex_shopping_10_16,"Hello, Blossom."
d_ex_shopping_10_17,Hi.
d_ex_shopping_10_18,"Hello, Miss Forsythia."
d_ex_shopping_10_19,That's it!
d_ex_shopping_10_20,You're the one who called me Forsythia last time.
d_ex_shopping_10_21,"I'm Flora, from Botanic Garden."
d_ex_shopping_10_22,Nice to meet you.
d_ex_shopping_10_23,Botanic Garden?
d_ex_shopping_10_24,You must know a lot about flowers then.
d_ex_shopping_10_25,"Yes, I'm quite knowledgeable."
d_ex_shopping_10_26,Do you have any questions?
d_ex_shopping_10_27,I certainly do!
d_ex_shopping_10_28,"We're developing a new fragrance at Rushae,"
d_ex_shopping_10_29,"and the theme we're going for this time is ""Fresh & Floral""."
d_ex_shopping_10_30,Fresh and floral?
d_ex_shopping_10_31,Sounds lovely.
d_ex_shopping_10_32,Isn't it? Hehe.
d_ex_shopping_10_33,Anyway...
d_ex_shopping_10_34,*Psssh*
d_ex_shopping_10_35,How about you try this scent?
d_ex_shopping_10_36,I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
d_ex_shopping_10_37,Flora takes a deep whiff of the perfume with an expression of intense concentration.
d_ex_shopping_10_38,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_10_39,This is a rose-based perfume.
d_ex_shopping_10_40,"Yes, that's it!"
d_ex_shopping_10_41,I incorporated rose to give it some sweetness without being cloying.
d_ex_shopping_10_42,It matches what you were going for.
d_ex_shopping_10_43,"However, if there's one thing I would like to call attention to,"
d_ex_shopping_10_44,it's that the freesia is a bit too prominent.
d_ex_shopping_10_45,"Oh my goodness, really?"
d_ex_shopping_10_46,"I thought only having rose would be a bit dull,"
d_ex_shopping_10_47,so I added a small amount of freesia. Does it not work?
d_ex_shopping_10_48,"It's not that it's bad, but the freesia overshadows the other notes a little too much."
d_ex_shopping_10_49,"If you want to add something that complements the rose,"
d_ex_shopping_10_50,why not try using geranium instead?
d_ex_shopping_10_51,Their profiles are a little more similar.
d_ex_shopping_10_52,"Okay, sure!"
d_ex_shopping_10_53,How do you spell that?
d_ex_shopping_10_54,G-e-r-a-n-i-u-m.
d_ex_shopping_10_55,"Okay, great! Noted."
d_ex_shopping_10_56,Then how about this scent?
d_ex_shopping_10_57,*Psssh*
d_ex_shopping_10_58,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_10_59,... Is it lavender mixed with hyacinth?
d_ex_shopping_10_60,That's right.
d_ex_shopping_10_61,"It's supposed to be more lavender-forward, but I thought this unusual combination actually blended quite well."
d_ex_shopping_10_62,"They're both so different... I don't think they're a particularly good match,"
d_ex_shopping_10_63,especially for a lavender-based perfume.
d_ex_shopping_10_64,Then what do you think would go well with it?
d_ex_shopping_10_65,Rosemary or peppermint would be nice.
d_ex_shopping_10_66,They're in the same herb family and have a refreshing quality that would complement the lavender nicely.
d_ex_shopping_10_67,"Oh, okay!"
d_ex_shopping_10_68,"You're really something, Flora."
d_ex_shopping_10_69,"You can tell what something is just by a quick sniff,"
d_ex_shopping_10_70,and you know right off the top of your head what to combine with what.
d_ex_shopping_10_71,"Well, I do spend much of my time around flowers and their fragrances."
d_ex_shopping_10_72,"I know which of them pair well with each other,"
d_ex_shopping_10_73,and which clash.
d_ex_shopping_10_74,"Okay, next I've got..."
d_ex_shopping_10_75,Oh darn.
d_ex_shopping_10_76,I only brought these two perfume samples with me.
d_ex_shopping_10_77,Flora.
d_ex_shopping_10_78,Would it be okay if we continue this conversation somewhere else?
d_ex_shopping_10_79,I'd love to get more of your advice on these perfumes.
d_ex_shopping_10_80,Please? I'll compensate you for your time.
d_ex_shopping_10_81,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_10_82,I'll go if Blossom comes with me.
d_ex_shopping_10_83,Huh? Why me?
d_ex_shopping_10_84,I'm particularly fond of the scent you're wearing today.
d_ex_shopping_10_85,"I'd like the opportunity to enjoy it more up close, hehe."
d_ex_shopping_10_86,"Sweetie, come with us."
d_ex_shopping_10_87,"I'll make sure you're compensated too, okay?"
d_ex_shopping_10_88,...
d_ex_shopping_10_89,"In the end, I find myself following Rupee and Flora,"
d_ex_shopping_10_90,sampling various perfumes and sharing my thoughts on each one.
d_ex_shopping_10_91,"My nose starts to go numb, and it's only when I can barely tell the scents apart that I manage to escape."
d_ex_armory_09_title,The Weight of Zero
d_ex_armory_09_1,*Zing*
d_ex_armory_09_2,"Ah,"
d_ex_armory_09_3,you're here.
d_ex_armory_09_4,"Welcome, Rapi."
d_ex_armory_09_5,"Wow, you came quicker than we expected. Hehe..."
d_ex_armory_09_6,"You asked me to come, so I rushed over."
d_ex_armory_09_7,Why'd you bring along the dead weight?
d_ex_armory_09_8,"I was curious what you all were up to, so I decided to tag along."
d_ex_armory_09_9,"So, what is it you all wanted to tell me?"
d_ex_armory_09_10,We want to take a look at your weapon.
d_ex_armory_09_11,"We're not planning on dismantling it or anything, mind you. We're just curious about the design. It's unlike anything we've seen before."
d_ex_armory_09_12,Would you be all right with that?
d_ex_armory_09_13,"If all you want to do is look at it, then sure."
d_ex_armory_09_14,Thanks.
d_ex_armory_09_15,"Then, could I... hold it, just once?"
d_ex_armory_09_16,"Sure, but be careful—it's heavy."
d_ex_armory_09_17,Okay...
d_ex_armory_09_18,Heave-ho...!
d_ex_armory_09_19,!!
d_ex_armory_09_20,"Hnrrrgh... Wow, i-it really is heavy!"
d_ex_armory_09_21,I wonder what's inside it?
d_ex_armory_09_22,"There was something that blasted out of it before, and made a heck of a bang! The firepower is incredible."
d_ex_armory_09_23,You're probably thinking of the drill bit projectile.
d_ex_armory_09_24,I see.
d_ex_armory_09_25,So that's how you manage to penetrate into the deepest recesses of a Rapture.
d_ex_armory_09_26,"For such an old weapon, it's in surprisingly good condition."
d_ex_armory_09_27,It must have been very well maintained.
d_ex_armory_09_28,"Mhmm, Grave intends on returning it to Snow White, so she's been fastidious about caring for it."
d_ex_armory_09_29,The fact it's housed inside a case has kept it in even better shape.
d_ex_armory_09_30,Who would've thought Grave's weapon case contained something like this.
d_ex_armory_09_31,Hmm...
d_ex_armory_09_32,"The Absolute Squad closely examines Rapi's gun, turning it over in their hands."
d_ex_armory_09_33,A few moments later.
d_ex_armory_09_34,Thanks for letting us get a good look at it.
d_ex_armory_09_35,"Even so, I'm still having a tough time comprehending how this weapon generates that energy and manifests in the form of a drill bit."
d_ex_armory_09_36,You mean you're unsure how it's activated?
d_ex_armory_09_37,Not just that.
d_ex_armory_09_38,I haven't even bothered attempting to understand how it functions or how it was made.
d_ex_armory_09_39,The only way someone could have created a gun of this caliber would be if they were utterly obsessed with drills.
d_ex_armory_09_40,...
d_ex_armory_09_41,I briefly think of Red Hood and quietly nod.
d_ex_armory_09_42,I doubt even the original owner expected this to come out as well as it did.
d_ex_armory_09_43,"Now that I've inherited such a fine weapon and become its owner,"
d_ex_armory_09_44,I'd better make good use of it.
d_ex_armory_09_45,...
d_ex_armory_09_46,"Hehe, I think this gun suits you perfectly, Rapi."
d_ex_armory_09_47,Really?
d_ex_armory_09_48,"Yeah, it's just like you."
d_ex_armory_09_49,Sturdy and penetrating.
d_ex_armory_09_50,"Isn't that right, Eunhwa?"
d_ex_armory_09_51,I'm not sure.
d_ex_armory_09_52,"As far as I can tell, she still looks soft."
d_ex_armory_09_53,Yeah.
d_ex_armory_09_54,Eunhwa is the penetrating one.
d_ex_armory_09_55,"Point and jagged, hehe..."
d_ex_armory_09_56,...
d_ex_armory_09_57,I'll toughen up.
d_ex_armory_09_58,I won't fall behind.
d_ex_armory_09_59,Do whatever you want. You can collapse or wear yourself to nothing for all I care. It's none of my business.
d_ex_armory_09_60,However.
d_ex_armory_09_61,Don't forget the load you're carrying by wielding that weapon.
d_ex_armory_09_62,... I won't.
d_ex_armory_09_63,"Thank you, Eunhwa."
d_ex_armory_09_64,"You too, Emma and Vesti."
d_ex_armory_09_65,"Heh, hehe..."
d_ex_armory_09_66,Have you seen everything you need?
d_ex_armory_09_67,"Yes, this should be enough."
d_ex_armory_09_68,"I wouldn't be able to figure out anything more, no matter how long I examined it."
d_ex_armory_09_69,"If I discover anything new while using it, I'll let you know."
d_ex_armory_09_70,"In return, can I take a look at your new weapons next time?"
d_ex_armory_09_71,You'd need Ingrid's permission for that.
d_ex_armory_09_72,C'mon Eunhwa... don't be so petty.
d_ex_armory_09_73,...
d_ex_armory_09_74,"You can come and see our weapons anytime, Rapi."
d_ex_armory_09_75,...
d_ex_armory_09_76,"Fine. There can be an exception for you, Rapi."
d_ex_armory_09_77,But no weaklings allowed.
d_ex_armory_09_78,...
d_ex_armory_09_79,I appreciate you granting me permission.
d_ex_armory_09_80,We should be the ones thanking you for showing us such an amazing weapon.
d_ex_armory_09_81,"Well then, I'll take my leave."
d_ex_armory_09_82,See you around.
d_ex_armory_09_83,"Let's go, Commander."
d_ex_armory_09_84,All right.
d_ex_armory_09_85,"Rapi lifts up the weapon with vigor,"
d_ex_armory_09_86,and leaves the Armory with a light and easy gait.
d_ex_command_08_title,"Familiar Space, Unfamiliar Atmosphere"
d_ex_command_08_1,Mmm...
d_ex_command_08_2,Beams of warm sunlight stream into the Commander's Room.
d_ex_command_08_3,"A cool breeze blows,"
d_ex_command_08_4,and swaying in the wind...
d_ex_command_08_5,... Red hair?
d_ex_command_08_6,"Ah, Commander."
d_ex_command_08_7,You're awake.
d_ex_command_08_8,You must have been rather exhausted.
d_ex_command_08_9,You've been sleeping for exactly 18 hours and 11 minutes.
d_ex_command_08_10,What?! I have?
d_ex_command_08_11,You should have woken me up earlier.
d_ex_command_08_12,I disagree. You've been bogged down with all manner of tasks ever since we got back to the Outpost.
d_ex_command_08_13,"This is a rare opportunity for you to relax, and you need plenty of rest."
d_ex_command_08_14,"Don't you have some time off as well, Rapi?"
d_ex_command_08_15,I do.
d_ex_command_08_16,Then why are you here?
d_ex_command_08_17,I...
d_ex_command_08_18,"I was sitting here, resting."
d_ex_command_08_19,Is that really all you were doing?
d_ex_command_08_20,Yes.
d_ex_command_08_21,"... Well, if I'm being honest,"
d_ex_command_08_22,"something about this place felt a bit different, so I was looking around."
d_ex_command_08_23,"Nothing about this room has changed, but you were sleeping so soundly."
d_ex_command_08_24,Maybe because it feels so peaceful in here.
d_ex_command_08_25,I feel it too.
d_ex_command_08_26,That seems to be the case.
d_ex_command_08_27,"We've spent a lot of time on the surface, where we can't afford to let our guard down even for a second."
d_ex_command_08_28,But it's strange.
d_ex_command_08_29,"I've come back to the Ark after long spells up on the surface numerous times,"
d_ex_command_08_30,but I've never felt this way before.
d_ex_command_08_31,Why do you think that is?
d_ex_command_08_32,Could it be because you didn't have anywhere that felt familiar before?
d_ex_command_08_33,Familiar...
d_ex_command_08_34,That makes sense.
d_ex_command_08_35,"The very fact that it's so familiar and comfortable makes it feel a bit strange to me, because I'm not used to feeling that way."
d_ex_command_08_36,This feeling of peace here is worlds apart from the life we lead up on the surface.
d_ex_command_08_37,Hmm...
d_ex_command_08_38,...
d_ex_command_08_39,...
d_ex_command_08_40,Ah.
d_ex_command_08_41,I think I understand a little now.
d_ex_command_08_42,Perhaps it's because
d_ex_command_08_43,I'm simply not used to things being so quiet.
d_ex_command_08_44,It is quiet right now. Almost too quiet.
d_ex_command_08_45,Yes.
d_ex_command_08_46,Usually you've got Anis noisily rummaging for a soda.
d_ex_command_08_47,Neon passionately shouting about firepower.
d_ex_command_08_48,Me letting out a belabored sigh as I watch them both.
d_ex_command_08_49,"And amidst it all, you smiling."
d_ex_command_08_50,That's the kind of atmosphere I'm used to experiencing in this place.
d_ex_command_08_51,This place is usually so clamorous.
d_ex_command_08_52,Hehe.
d_ex_command_08_53,But the fact it's so quiet now is what allowed you to sleep as long as you did.
d_ex_command_08_54,That's true...
d_ex_command_08_55,Are you feeling recharged?
d_ex_command_08_56,Completely.
d_ex_command_08_57,I'm glad to hear it.
d_ex_command_08_58,Would you like to go somewhere together?
d_ex_command_08_59,I'm still having a hard time adjusting to a tranquil Commander's Room.
d_ex_command_08_60,That's a great idea.
d_ex_command_08_61,I'll get cleaned up and join you in a minute.
d_ex_command_08_62,Understood.
d_ex_command_08_63,I'll wait outside.
d_ex_command_08_64,"Rapi and I leave the abnormally quiet Commander's Room together,"
d_ex_command_08_65,and go to spend some time wandering around the lively and bustling Outpost.
d_ex_gym_10_title,Stress Management
d_ex_gym_10_1,"Thanks for coming to the gym with me today, Commander."
d_ex_gym_10_2,"Sure thing. I need to get some exercise in, anyhow."
d_ex_gym_10_3,*Zing*
d_ex_gym_10_4,"Oh, hi Gym Rat."
d_ex_gym_10_5,"Hello, Rumani."
d_ex_gym_10_6,Have you been keeping up with your exercise routine?
d_ex_gym_10_7,I haven't seen you at the gym all that much lately.
d_ex_gym_10_8,I've been working hard at it.
d_ex_gym_10_9,I'll get back at it soon enough.
d_ex_gym_10_10,Really?
d_ex_gym_10_11,"If you're lying, I'll make you do 1000 burpees later."
d_ex_gym_10_12,I knew it.
d_ex_gym_10_13,Stay for a while and give me 1000 burpees before you go.
d_ex_gym_10_14,...
d_ex_gym_10_15,"Mana, you signed up for group training today, yes?"
d_ex_gym_10_16,Hmm... But doesn't your body technically not require any exercise?
d_ex_gym_10_17,"That's correct,"
d_ex_gym_10_18,but I've been under a lot of stress lately.
d_ex_gym_10_19,"I heard that exercising helps relieve tension, so I came to get a few pointers."
d_ex_gym_10_20,Do you find yourself stressed on a regular basis?
d_ex_gym_10_21,"Yeah, I even felt high-strung on my way to the gym just now."
d_ex_gym_10_22,Oh dear.
d_ex_gym_10_23,"Well, if you want to alleviate your stress, exercise is your best bet."
d_ex_gym_10_24,"Whenever I personally start feeling stressed, I do a light 10-hour workout,"
d_ex_gym_10_25,and it works wonders.
d_ex_gym_10_26,...
d_ex_gym_10_27,"Anyway, you've come to the right place."
d_ex_gym_10_28,Our center has special equipment designed exclusively for Nikkes.
d_ex_gym_10_29,Have you ever exercised before?
d_ex_gym_10_30,"No, it's my first time, so I'm a bit nervous."
d_ex_gym_10_31,My coordination isn't exactly the best.
d_ex_gym_10_32,"It's okay. You've got me as your trainer, plus Gym Rat assisting."
d_ex_gym_10_33,"He knows a lot about physical fitness, so he'll be able to help you out."
d_ex_gym_10_34,"Isn't that right, Gym Rat?"
d_ex_gym_10_35,Hit a profile chest pose.
d_ex_gym_10_36,Show off biceps.
d_ex_gym_10_37,Huh? I think you've lost some muscle definition.
d_ex_gym_10_38,Maybe it's because of the clothes you're wearing?
d_ex_gym_10_39,I'll give you a proper post-workout once-over with your clothes off.
d_ex_gym_10_40,Er... that's not exactly the reaction I was going for... but okay.
d_ex_gym_10_41,"Now then, let's get started."
d_ex_gym_10_42,We'll kick off with some light stretching.
d_ex_gym_10_43,"Rotate your hands, followed by your ankles. Then the knees and neck."
d_ex_gym_10_44,Mana and I follow Rumani's lead and stretch.
d_ex_gym_10_45,The first exercise we're going to do is what we call a leg raise.
d_ex_gym_10_46,"You lift up your legs while keeping your core engaged, then rinse and repeat."
d_ex_gym_10_47,"It can be pretty intense trying to lower your legs slowly,"
d_ex_gym_10_48,but it gets much easier when you raise them.
d_ex_gym_10_49,??
d_ex_gym_10_50,Try it out for yourself and you'll see what I mean.
d_ex_gym_10_51,...
d_ex_gym_10_52,Let's get to it.
d_ex_gym_10_53,"First, lie down on the mat and press your back against the floor. Then lift your legs..."
d_ex_gym_10_54,And slowly lower them.
d_ex_gym_10_55,Got it.
d_ex_gym_10_56,You need to lower your legs a little more.
d_ex_gym_10_57,But they're already so low...
d_ex_gym_10_58,A little more.
d_ex_gym_10_59,Urgh...!
d_ex_gym_10_60,"You too, Gym Rat. Get your legs lower."
d_ex_gym_10_61,Hnrrrgh!
d_ex_gym_10_62,Be sure to keep your back pressed against the floor.
d_ex_gym_10_63,Huff!
d_ex_gym_10_64,Puff!
d_ex_gym_10_65,That's it! Now lift your legs again.
d_ex_gym_10_66,Whew...
d_ex_gym_10_67,*Gasp*
d_ex_gym_10_68,"How does it feel, Mana? Not bad, right?"
d_ex_gym_10_69,Hmm... I'm not sure.
d_ex_gym_10_70,And your stress? Are you feeling better?
d_ex_gym_10_71,I can't really tell...
d_ex_gym_10_72,Really? It's probably because you've only done one rep.
d_ex_gym_10_73,"Since it's your first time, let's go easy and do 10 sets, 10 reps each."
d_ex_gym_10_74,"By the end, your stress will be completely gone. I guarantee it."
d_ex_gym_10_75,...
d_ex_gym_10_76,...
d_ex_gym_10_77,Soon after.
d_ex_gym_10_78,*Slump*
d_ex_gym_10_79,"*Gasp, gasp*..."
d_ex_gym_10_80,"Huff, huff..."
d_ex_gym_10_81,"All right you two, no rest for the wicked! Let's head straight into the second exercise:"
d_ex_gym_10_82,The leg press.
d_ex_gym_10_83,Have you heard of it?
d_ex_gym_10_84,"No, I haven't."
d_ex_gym_10_85,We'll be using this machine here. I'll explain and show you how to operate it.
d_ex_gym_10_86,"If we're keeping it simple,"
d_ex_gym_10_87,"all you do is lie down on top of the machine, and push the board with your legs."
d_ex_gym_10_88,*Whoosh* *Whoosh*
d_ex_gym_10_89,Rumani starts to do leg presses.
d_ex_gym_10_90,Huff! Huff! Like this! Push with your legs! And put your back into it!
d_ex_gym_10_91,"The more I handle heavy weights, the more my stress seems to fade away."
d_ex_gym_10_92,"Even now, I can feel it dissipating."
d_ex_gym_10_93,Huff! Huff!
d_ex_gym_10_94,"In fact, I think I'll do some leg presses during my own workout today."
d_ex_gym_10_95,...
d_ex_gym_10_96,...
d_ex_gym_10_97,"Oh, sorry. My bad, Gym Rat."
d_ex_gym_10_98,"Sometimes I get too absorbed into the workout... Now then, how about you start, Mana?"
d_ex_gym_10_99,Okay.
d_ex_gym_10_100,*Whoosh* *Whoosh*
d_ex_gym_10_101,Huff! Huff!
d_ex_gym_10_102,Your posture is good. You're doing well.
d_ex_gym_10_103,"In fact, I think we can add some more weight."
d_ex_gym_10_104,"Gym Rat, would you like to try too?"
d_ex_gym_10_105,Okay.
d_ex_gym_10_106,*Whoosh* *Whoosh*
d_ex_gym_10_107,Huff! Huff!
d_ex_gym_10_108,"Okay, good job."
d_ex_gym_10_109,"How about it, Mana?"
d_ex_gym_10_110,Do you feel your stress fading?
d_ex_gym_10_111,"Yes, I think so."
d_ex_gym_10_112,"Maybe it's the adrenaline, but it does feel like there's not as much tension as before."
d_ex_gym_10_113,??
d_ex_gym_10_114,You see? Exercise is vital for this kind of thing.
d_ex_gym_10_115,"How about we add some more weight,"
d_ex_gym_10_116,"and do 10 sets, 30 reps each?"
d_ex_gym_10_117,...
d_ex_gym_10_118,...
d_ex_gym_10_119,"For our third exercise, we have..."
d_ex_gym_10_120,*Slump*
d_ex_gym_10_121,"Huff, huff."
d_ex_gym_10_122,"Puff, puff."
d_ex_gym_10_123,Ru-Rumani. Wait a second...
d_ex_gym_10_124,Oof... I feel like throwing up...
d_ex_gym_10_125,"Don't worry. Once you have some water, you'll be right as rain."
d_ex_gym_10_126,We've still got five more exercises to go. You can't be tapping out so soon.
d_ex_gym_10_127,You've got to be kidding me.
d_ex_gym_10_128,"How about you, Mana?"
d_ex_gym_10_129,How are you feeling stress-wise?
d_ex_gym_10_130,"I do feel like most of it's gone... actually, maybe all of it."
d_ex_gym_10_131,That's fantastic! Then let's keep up the momentum.
d_ex_gym_10_132,I'll make sure that stress stays gone.
d_ex_gym_10_133,...
d_ex_gym_10_134,"Before we go into the third exercise, can the Commander and I have some water?"
d_ex_gym_10_135,We need to catch our breath.
d_ex_gym_10_136,"Sure, of course."
d_ex_gym_10_137,Th... urgh... thanks.
d_ex_gym_10_138,"My goodness, you look pretty pooped, Gym Rat."
d_ex_gym_10_139,Let's take a 10-minute break.
d_ex_gym_10_140,It'll give me a chance to get in a personal workout.
d_ex_gym_10_141,"When I was giving that demonstration earlier, it really got my body itching for a proper routine."
d_ex_gym_10_142,"... Okay, thanks."
d_ex_gym_10_143,Mana and I head to the reception area for some water.
d_ex_gym_10_144,"Whew... Commander, I say we hightail it outta here."
d_ex_gym_10_145,??
d_ex_gym_10_146,You want to know the truth? I haven't felt a single ounce of stress go away this entire time.
d_ex_gym_10_147,"If anything, it feels like it's piling up even more."
d_ex_gym_10_148,But you said earlier that you felt better.
d_ex_gym_10_149,I only did that so she wouldn't make me do more exercises.
d_ex_gym_10_150,"I knew that if I told her I wasn't feeling anything,"
d_ex_gym_10_151,she'd force me to go harder.
d_ex_gym_10_152,"At least, that's what I thought."
d_ex_gym_10_153,"It seems that no matter what I tell her, Rumani has no intention of stopping the routine."
d_ex_gym_10_154,So I say we escape.
d_ex_gym_10_155,I'll message Rumani saying that something urgent came up at the lab and I need to leave.
d_ex_gym_10_156,Good idea.
d_ex_gym_10_157,"Mana and I bolt out of the gym, keeping out of Rumani's sight."
d_ex_modernbar_11_title,After-Work Gathering
d_ex_modernbar_11_1,"After receiving a message from Mana telling me she was having a drink, I head to the Trendy Bar."
d_ex_modernbar_11_2,*Ring*
d_ex_modernbar_11_3,"Mana, I'm her..."
d_ex_modernbar_11_4,!!
d_ex_modernbar_11_5,Whaaaa?!
d_ex_modernbar_11_6,Newbie? What are you doing here? *Hicc*!
d_ex_modernbar_11_7,"I was just thinking about you, Commander, and here you are, right in front of me!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_8,"I'm not dreaming, am I?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_9,This is no dream.
d_ex_modernbar_11_10,Because I asked... asked him to come.
d_ex_modernbar_11_11,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_12,"Upon arriving at the bar, I find Yulha, Brid, and Mana all hammered."
d_ex_modernbar_11_13,As expected of Mana... you... you've got a good head on your shoulders.
d_ex_modernbar_11_14,Cheers to you!
d_ex_modernbar_11_15,"Hehe, it's good see... seeing you again, Newbie. It's been a hot minute."
d_ex_modernbar_11_16,"*Hicc* Yes, cheers to you, Mana!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_17,You're the reason why we've all gathered here today!
d_ex_modernbar_11_18,What's going on?
d_ex_modernbar_11_19,What? You came here without even knowing why?
d_ex_modernbar_11_20,Tsk.
d_ex_modernbar_11_21,That's simp... *Hicc*... simply unacceptable!
d_ex_modernbar_11_22,That's because no one told me.
d_ex_modernbar_11_23,"No excuses! Anyway, I'll only tell you this once, so listen carefully."
d_ex_modernbar_11_24,"Don't worry, Commander."
d_ex_modernbar_11_25,"If you don't catch what she says, I'll fill you in later."
d_ex_modernbar_11_26,M-me too! I'll let you know.
d_ex_modernbar_11_27,I've got your back.
d_ex_modernbar_11_28,"There's a whole bunch I can't tell you for security reasons, but this I can tell you."
d_ex_modernbar_11_29,Why is Yulha the one explaining?
d_ex_modernbar_11_30,"Mana seems to be the focus here, so why can't she ex..."
d_ex_modernbar_11_31,Silence!
d_ex_modernbar_11_32,... Fine.
d_ex_modernbar_11_33,"Let's see, let's see... where should I start?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_34,I listen closely to Yulha's slurred explanation.
d_ex_modernbar_11_35,"So to summarize, the reason for all this drinking tonight"
d_ex_modernbar_11_36,is because Mana felt upset about not being praised enough?
d_ex_modernbar_11_37,Precisely. Looks like I did a nice job explaining!
d_ex_modernbar_11_38,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_39,"I have emotions too, and so there are days where I need some praise."
d_ex_modernbar_11_40,"Especially on days like today, when the results are exceptional! And my presentation went perfectly!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_41,"I worked on this project for three months, you know."
d_ex_modernbar_11_42,And it was perfect!
d_ex_modernbar_11_43,"So, just for today, couldn't someone say, ""Well done"" at least once?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_44,How... How could everyone just move on without a single compliment...?
d_ex_modernbar_11_45,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_46,But!
d_ex_modernbar_11_47,I shouldn't stand around bellyaching. I have a position to uphold.
d_ex_modernbar_11_48,"No no, you're perfectly justified in wanting to complain! They say that praise is a panacea."
d_ex_modernbar_11_49,"I'm dying for some encouraging words myself, but Privaty and Admi give me nothing. You know how sad that makes me?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_50,I'm in the same boat. It's not easy...
d_ex_modernbar_11_51,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_52,Newbie.
d_ex_modernbar_11_53,Don't ever hold back on the accolades! Got that?
d_ex_modernbar_11_54,A single compliment can be a source of inexhaustible strength for someone.
d_ex_modernbar_11_55,I've always been good about giving compliments.
d_ex_modernbar_11_56,"I know, and I'm saying to keep it up."
d_ex_modernbar_11_57,*Sigh*...
d_ex_modernbar_11_58,Tod... Today is all about praising Mana bunches and bunches.
d_ex_modernbar_11_59,Sorry?
d_ex_modernbar_11_60,"Sure, I'll start."
d_ex_modernbar_11_61,"Mana, you're so kind!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_62,And you're great at what you do.
d_ex_modernbar_11_63,You're also super smart!
d_ex_modernbar_11_64,And you're cool.
d_ex_modernbar_11_65,"Come on, Commander, aren't you going to compliment Mana?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_66,"Yeah, you should join in, Newbie... *Hicc*!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_67,"Oh, I didn't realize I was supposed to be joining."
d_ex_modernbar_11_68,"You're very pretty, Mana."
d_ex_modernbar_11_69,You're very... um...
d_ex_modernbar_11_70,... Can you not think of a single nice thing to say to me?
d_ex_modernbar_11_71,"Not at all. It's that there are so many positive things to say, I can't choose which."
d_ex_modernbar_11_72,Because you're simply perfect.
d_ex_modernbar_11_73,!!
d_ex_modernbar_11_74,"Hey, are you okay, Mana? Your face is all red."
d_ex_modernbar_11_75,I knew it.
d_ex_modernbar_11_76,"This isn't your first rodeo, is it, Newbie?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_77,The three of you seem to meet often.
d_ex_modernbar_11_78,"Oh yeah, we do gather fairly often."
d_ex_modernbar_11_79,We certainly do.
d_ex_modernbar_11_80,"We got together last week, and the week before that."
d_ex_modernbar_11_81,To drink?
d_ex_modernbar_11_82,We don't just drink.
d_ex_modernbar_11_83,We commiserate about our worktime joys and sorrows.
d_ex_modernbar_11_84,And on the struggles of being a working stiff!
d_ex_modernbar_11_85,I see.
d_ex_modernbar_11_86,"Anyway, Mana!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_87,Have another drink and wash away today's troubles.
d_ex_modernbar_11_88,I propose a toast!
d_ex_modernbar_11_89,I don't think it's a good idea for them to keep drinking.
d_ex_modernbar_11_90,I should send them home.
d_ex_modernbar_11_91,"I think that's enough for tonight, ladies."
d_ex_modernbar_11_92,What? Did you just tell us to stop drinking?
d_ex_modernbar_11_93,"What did you say, Commander?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_94,Care to repeat that?
d_ex_modernbar_11_95,"Almost at once, Yulha, Brid, and Mana speak with crystal-clear enunciation and glare at me with icy stares."
d_ex_modernbar_11_96,Er... nothing. I meant that... it looks like you all need some more snacks.
d_ex_modernbar_11_97,Would you like me to order more?
d_ex_modernbar_11_98,"That's more like it. I knew you were sensible, Newbie."
d_ex_modernbar_11_99,"You're the best, Commander."
d_ex_modernbar_11_100,If only everyone else at the lab were like you. How wonderful that would be...
d_ex_modernbar_11_101,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_102,"However, we don't need any snacks."
d_ex_modernbar_11_103,"Why not, you ask?"
d_ex_modernbar_11_104,Because life itself is a snack!
d_ex_modernbar_11_105,"Wow,"
d_ex_modernbar_11_106,"that's beautiful, Mana."
d_ex_modernbar_11_107,A quote for the ages! Brilliant!
d_ex_modernbar_11_108,...
d_ex_modernbar_11_109,The trio continue to drink for the next few hours.
d_ex_modernbar_11_110,Soon after.
d_ex_modernbar_11_111,"Oh boy, I think I... I think I'm getting a bit tipsy."
d_ex_modernbar_11_112,You've been plastered this entire time.
d_ex_modernbar_11_113,What do you mean?! I was perfectly fine before.
d_ex_modernbar_11_114,"I feel a heck of a lot better now, thanks to you all."
d_ex_modernbar_11_115,And that's all that matters.
d_ex_modernbar_11_116,Let's meet again sometime soon.
d_ex_modernbar_11_117,"Right, right. Let's hurry home."
d_ex_modernbar_11_118,Right! Let's go!
d_ex_modernbar_11_119,Let's hurr...
d_ex_modernbar_11_120,*Bang*!
d_ex_modernbar_11_121,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_122,"Um, Yulha..."
d_ex_modernbar_11_123,"Yulha, you can't sleep here."
d_ex_modernbar_11_124,You need to go ho...
d_ex_modernbar_11_125,*Bang*!
d_ex_modernbar_11_126,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_127,"Oh, for crying out loud."
d_ex_modernbar_11_128,"Don't worry, Commander. I'll get everyone home safely!"
d_ex_modernbar_11_129,You... you go ahe...
d_ex_modernbar_11_130,*Bang*!
d_ex_modernbar_11_131,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_132,Is this for real?
d_ex_modernbar_11_133,Wake up.
d_ex_modernbar_11_134,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_135,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_136,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_11_137,I said wake up!
d_ex_modernbar_11_138,"No matter how much I try, no one moves an inch."
d_ex_modernbar_11_139,*Sigh*... I could use a drink myself right about now.
d_ex_toyshop_10_title,Mutual Aid
d_ex_toyshop_10_1,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_10_2,"Hey, Master Captain!"
d_ex_toyshop_10_3,"Hey, Mast."
d_ex_toyshop_10_4,What are you doing here?
d_ex_toyshop_10_5,"I came to see Belorta and Mica, what about you?"
d_ex_toyshop_10_6,I want to buy Morgan some new clothes.
d_ex_toyshop_10_7,His outfit tore while we were working at the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_toyshop_10_8,Why didn't you go to a clothing store?
d_ex_toyshop_10_9,Nothing I'd find at a clothing store would be able to fit Morgan.
d_ex_toyshop_10_10,He's no bigger than a doll.
d_ex_toyshop_10_11,"Oh, I guess you're right."
d_ex_toyshop_10_12,Doofus! Doofus!
d_ex_toyshop_10_13,...
d_ex_toyshop_10_14,"Anyway, I think Belorta and Mica have stepped out."
d_ex_toyshop_10_15,The place was empty when I got here.
d_ex_toyshop_10_16,I wonder where they could have gone?
d_ex_toyshop_10_17,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_10_18,Hello Bel—Huh? Trainer?
d_ex_toyshop_10_19,"Hi, Biscuit."
d_ex_toyshop_10_20,What a treat running into you here!
d_ex_toyshop_10_21,"Hi, Biscuit."
d_ex_toyshop_10_22,"Oh, hey, Mast. I didn't see you there."
d_ex_toyshop_10_23,What are you doing at the toy store?
d_ex_toyshop_10_24,I came to buy some toys for the puppies.
d_ex_toyshop_10_25,"I bought some yesterday, but they broke right away."
d_ex_toyshop_10_26,...
d_ex_toyshop_10_27,Where are Belorta and Mica?
d_ex_toyshop_10_28,We think they must have gone somewhere else for a bit.
d_ex_toyshop_10_29,"I see... The puppies are all waiting for me, so I really need to hurry back."
d_ex_toyshop_10_30,And I need to buy Morgan some new duds and get back to the Maid Cafe ASAP.
d_ex_toyshop_10_31,What was that about Morgan?
d_ex_toyshop_10_32,"His clothes got torn, so I'm getting him new threads."
d_ex_toyshop_10_33,"Oh, gotcha! Why don't I lend you some puppy clothes?"
d_ex_toyshop_10_34,Puppy clothes?
d_ex_toyshop_10_35,Wouldn't that work in a pinch?
d_ex_toyshop_10_36,"Hmm... I appreciate the offer, but we need something pretty specific."
d_ex_toyshop_10_37,"A butler outfit, to be precise."
d_ex_toyshop_10_38,"Oh, sorry, but I don't have anything like that."
d_ex_toyshop_10_39,Biscuit's ears and tail droop.
d_ex_toyshop_10_40,You don't have to apologize!
d_ex_toyshop_10_41,"Jeez, it's been a while already."
d_ex_toyshop_10_42,The cafe is gonna be packed with customers before long.
d_ex_toyshop_10_43,"As soon as Mica and Belorta return, I'll buy some clothes and bring them to the Maid Cafe."
d_ex_toyshop_10_44,"Really? If you could do that, you'd be a real lifesaver!"
d_ex_toyshop_10_45,"Sorry Morgan, but you'll have to go without clothes for a bit."
d_ex_toyshop_10_46,Embarrassing! Embarrassing!
d_ex_toyshop_10_47,I just thought of something! Would a cape work by any chance?
d_ex_toyshop_10_48,A crepe? How's that going to help?
d_ex_toyshop_10_49,"Not crepe, cape! Here, let me show you."
d_ex_toyshop_10_50,Biscuit pulls a cape with a black ribbon out of her bag.
d_ex_toyshop_10_51,"Oh wow, this should fit with the maid concept perfectly!"
d_ex_toyshop_10_52,Good! I put this around the puppies' necks whenever they're feeling chilly.
d_ex_toyshop_10_53,"Morgan, could you indulge me?"
d_ex_toyshop_10_54,*Flutter*
d_ex_toyshop_10_55,Morgan flies over to Biscuit.
d_ex_toyshop_10_56,This cape is the one the youngest puppy at the shelter wears.
d_ex_toyshop_10_57,I just hope it'll fit.
d_ex_toyshop_10_58,Biscuit ties the cape around Morgan's neck.
d_ex_toyshop_10_59,Hmm... it's a bit loose.
d_ex_toyshop_10_60,"Well, a bird's neck and a dog's neck are worlds apart."
d_ex_toyshop_10_61,"I guess there's not much else we can do. I appreciate you trying to help, Biscuit."
d_ex_toyshop_10_62,"No worries, the cape is adjustable!"
d_ex_toyshop_10_63,*Stretch*
d_ex_toyshop_10_64,Biscuit pulls the elastic band at the back of the cape.
d_ex_toyshop_10_65,"If I tighten up the elastic band, it should fit, but it may be a bit uncomfortable..."
d_ex_toyshop_10_66,Perfect fit! Perfect fit!
d_ex_toyshop_10_67,"Does it feel okay, Morgan?"
d_ex_toyshop_10_68,"Dogs come in all different shapes and sizes, so I modified the cape to make it adjustable."
d_ex_toyshop_10_69,"That way, all kinds of puppers can fit into it."
d_ex_toyshop_10_70,You're so talented!
d_ex_toyshop_10_71,"Ha, this is puppy care 101."
d_ex_toyshop_10_72,It looks good on Morgan.
d_ex_toyshop_10_73,Thanks! Thanks!
d_ex_toyshop_10_74,"Will it be okay if I borrow this cape, just for today?"
d_ex_toyshop_10_75,Of course. The puppies don't usually like wearing it because they find it uncomfortable.
d_ex_toyshop_10_76,Thanks! I'll take good care of it and return it to you as soon as I can.
d_ex_toyshop_10_77,"Hehe, hurry along then."
d_ex_toyshop_10_78,I've got to get back to the shelter as well.
d_ex_toyshop_10_79,It's time to play fetch with the puppies.
d_ex_toyshop_10_80,"... But I guess I can't do that, actually. Since I wasn't able to buy a ball."
d_ex_toyshop_10_81,Would this starfish toy work?
d_ex_toyshop_10_82,Hmm? What's this?
d_ex_toyshop_10_83,"I bought some as decorations for the Maid Cafe,"
d_ex_toyshop_10_84,and I have one left over.
d_ex_toyshop_10_85,Do you think this would work for playing fetch?
d_ex_toyshop_10_86,Oh sure! Those furry lil' guys will play with just about anything.
d_ex_toyshop_10_87,"I'm glad to hear that. In that case, consider this a gift."
d_ex_toyshop_10_88,Really?
d_ex_toyshop_10_89,"You really saved our butts, so it's only right that Morgan and I repay you in the pirate fashion."
d_ex_toyshop_10_90,"Hehe, thanks."
d_ex_toyshop_10_91,"Oh boy, would you look at the time? I've gotta get going."
d_ex_toyshop_10_92,See you around.
d_ex_toyshop_10_93,I've gotta run too.
d_ex_toyshop_10_94,"Goodbye, everyone."
d_ex_toyshop_10_95,Mast and Biscuit leave the toy store.
d_ex_toyshop_10_96,...
d_ex_toyshop_10_97,I guess I should head out as well.

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_10,It's okay.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_11,I tidy up this place fairly regularly to keep it maintained.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_12,"No wonder it's so clean, even though no one's using it."
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_13,As for why you're so fastidious about keeping a place like this clean... I won't pry.

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_28,Er... yeah.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_29,That's a bit rich coming from you.

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_62,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_63,Tell them I like bunny girls.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_64,Tell them that maids are obviously superior.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_65,*Swoosh*
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_66,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_67,The mere act of looking at these bunny girl outfits has made things awkward.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_68,It might be best to go with a little white lie.
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_69,"Er... Maids are the best, of course!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_70,"Maids are the best, of course!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_71,"They're devoted to their customers, and there's a huge amount of variety between them."
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_72,And...

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_79,Probably similar things to what we do.

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_89,Bunny girl maid?
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_90,"You seemed rather vexed, and so I got to thinking."
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_91,And I came up with an answer: Bunny girl maids!
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_92,Is such a thing even possible?
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_93,You can't randomly mix two things together and call it an improvement.

d_ex_mysteryclub_07_100,"Master, what do you think about bunny girl maids?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_101,Well...
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_102,"No, I can't accept this."
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_103,"At the very least, it should be maid bunny girls, don't you think?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_104,That□□※could work too.▣
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_105,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_07_106,Only after we spend a significant amount of time debating the relationship between maids and bunny girls are we finally able to start cleaning.
d_ex_command_09_title,Legendary Maid's Performance
d_ex_command_09_1,"For the past few days, I've been swamped with Central Government-related work."
d_ex_command_09_2,Ugh...
d_ex_command_09_3,Commander. You missed this section here.
d_ex_command_09_4,"Oh, right. Sorry."
d_ex_command_09_5,It's perfectly alright.
d_ex_command_09_6,"When you're dealing with such a heavy workload, it's natural to lose your ability to concentrate fully."
d_ex_command_09_7,That's why I'm here to help.
d_ex_command_09_8,"Yeah, thank you for that. You're a lifesaver, Privaty."
d_ex_command_09_9,You're the one who brought me all this work in the first place...
d_ex_command_09_10,"Hehe... go on, hurry up and finish what you've got in front of you."
d_ex_command_09_11,It's not like I had a say in the matter!
d_ex_command_09_12,"Okay, fine."
d_ex_command_09_13,After addressing the points Privaty raised and tackling a few more documents...
d_ex_command_09_14,I think I'm almost done.
d_ex_command_09_15,I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
d_ex_command_09_16,"Great work, Commander."
d_ex_command_09_17,"Once we're done here, I'll need to go file a report."
d_ex_command_09_18,"While I'm doing that, you'll be able to take a break."
d_ex_command_09_19,I think I'll do exactly that.
d_ex_command_09_20,...
d_ex_command_09_21,"After handling something mentally taxing,"
d_ex_command_09_22,it's important to take a breather before diving back in.
d_ex_command_09_23,It might be boring for you to be on your own during a break.
d_ex_command_09_24,"If... if you'd like, I could join you."
d_ex_command_09_25,...
d_ex_command_09_26,*Zing*
d_ex_command_09_27,"Master Captain, are you here?"
d_ex_command_09_28,"Hello, Master."
d_ex_command_09_29,Mast? Ade?
d_ex_command_09_30,What's going on?
d_ex_command_09_31,What else would a pair of maids be doing here?
d_ex_command_09_32,We're paying you a visit to serve you.
d_ex_command_09_33,What the...?
d_ex_command_09_34,Why does this kind of stuff always happen when I'm around?
d_ex_command_09_35,I never requested this...
d_ex_command_09_36,!
d_ex_command_09_37,I get it now! You're plotting to force me into the maid business!
d_ex_command_09_38,I knew it!
d_ex_command_09_39,"I'm not some mindless automaton, you know? I won't just do whatever you want me to."
d_ex_command_09_40,"I'm here as a member of the Central Government, not as a maid."
d_ex_command_09_41,"I don't care who you are, you can't force me into being a maid!"
d_ex_command_09_42,...
d_ex_command_09_43,"Although, if you asked me nicely,"
d_ex_command_09_44,I suppose I could dabble in it for a little while.
d_ex_command_09_45,...
d_ex_command_09_46,"Jeez, Privaty, quit making a scene."
d_ex_command_09_47,"Haha, we didn't mean anything by it, Privaty."
d_ex_command_09_48,Master has been incredibly busy for the past few days.
d_ex_command_09_49,"He hasn't been able to rest or eat properly, so we decided to come see him."
d_ex_command_09_50,Oh... I-I see.
d_ex_command_09_51,I'm sorry. I misunderstood.
d_ex_command_09_52,"No, you were spot on. We are paying a house call to provide maid services."
d_ex_command_09_53,We just didn't know you'd be here.
d_ex_command_09_54,"But since you are, would you like to join us?"
d_ex_command_09_55,I don't know...
d_ex_command_09_56,"If we had a legendary maid like yourself chipping in, it'd be perfect."
d_ex_command_09_57,"... Did you say, ""legendary maid""?"
d_ex_command_09_58,You mean you don't know?
d_ex_command_09_59,"At the Maid Cafe, you're a living legend."
d_ex_command_09_60,What are you talking about?
d_ex_command_09_61,"Even though you became a maid against your will,"
d_ex_command_09_62,"you nonetheless worked hard to satisfy the customers, and eventually became the best maid around."
d_ex_command_09_63,"AKA, a living legend!"
d_ex_command_09_64,...
d_ex_command_09_65,I'm also striving to become a pro maid.
d_ex_command_09_66,"When it comes to embodying romance and adventure, I can't let anyone else show me up!"
d_ex_command_09_67,"Gaze upon my majestic uniform, and weep!"
d_ex_command_09_68,...
d_ex_command_09_69,"Come on, don't be like that, Privaty."
d_ex_command_09_70,Mast and everyone else all mean well.
d_ex_command_09_71,... Hmph.
d_ex_command_09_72,"So, are you in or what?"
d_ex_command_09_73,"Absolutely not! I already told you, I'm not a maid, but an employee of the Central Gover—"
d_ex_command_09_74,Wait!
d_ex_command_09_75,?
d_ex_command_09_76,A maid from the Central Government... I like the sound of that.
d_ex_command_09_77,What are you talking about?
d_ex_command_09_78,I recently read a manga about something like that.
d_ex_command_09_79,There was a maid whose master worked in the Central Government.
d_ex_command_09_80,She hid her identity and got a job in the Central Government in order to also assist her master while they were at work.
d_ex_command_09_81,"During the day, they were coworkers, boss and subordinate,"
d_ex_command_09_82,"but after hours, she served as his maid."
d_ex_command_09_83,"The maid proved to be so capable, that she eventually went on to become her master's boss at work."
d_ex_command_09_84,!
d_ex_command_09_85,I certainly wouldn't consider the Commander my subordinate...
d_ex_command_09_86,But that does sound intriguing.
d_ex_command_09_87,...
d_ex_command_09_88,Could you let me know the name of that manga?
d_ex_command_09_89,Sure thing! I can also recommend you ones that are similar.
d_ex_command_09_90,...
d_ex_command_09_91,Master. Let me prepare you a meal first.
d_ex_command_09_92,... Thanks.
d_ex_command_09_93,The three Nikkes continue to converse about manga
d_ex_command_09_94,all the way until I'm finished with my dessert.
d_ex_tower_08_title,Radio Girl
d_ex_tower_08_1,At the top of the Outpost's radio tower.
d_ex_tower_08_2,Hmm...
d_ex_tower_08_3,...
d_ex_tower_08_4,Anchor is recharging her signal.
d_ex_tower_08_5,Is it working?
d_ex_tower_08_6,"The device seems fine, but..."
d_ex_tower_08_7,Let me try.
d_ex_tower_08_8,Hyah!
d_ex_tower_08_9,...
d_ex_tower_08_10,...
d_ex_tower_08_11,...
d_ex_tower_08_12,...
d_ex_tower_08_13,"How about it, Starfish?"
d_ex_tower_08_14,Is it emitting any signal?
d_ex_tower_08_15,...
d_ex_tower_08_16,"That's a question for you, Master."
d_ex_tower_08_17,Starfish is asking you if there's any signal.
d_ex_tower_08_18,I'm not sure.
d_ex_tower_08_19,"Anchor, have you ever heard of the term ""Denpa-kei""?"
d_ex_tower_08_20,?
d_ex_tower_08_21,"No, what is it? Someone who likes living in a den?"
d_ex_tower_08_22,... Never mind.
d_ex_tower_08_23,Hmm...
d_ex_tower_08_24,"Honestly, I wasn't too optimistic about it working either."
d_ex_tower_08_25,"Normally, it should detect everyone in the Outpost,"
d_ex_tower_08_26,"but right now, all it's detecting is Master."
d_ex_tower_08_27,How about Trony and me?
d_ex_tower_08_28,Nope. Nothing. Only Master.
d_ex_tower_08_29,What? That can't be right...
d_ex_tower_08_30,That is rather peculiar.
d_ex_tower_08_31,It's been like that for a while now.
d_ex_tower_08_32,"When I asked Mast about it, she said it had something to do with ""maid power""."
d_ex_tower_08_33,Apparently there's some kind of connection.
d_ex_tower_08_34,Maid power?
d_ex_tower_08_35,She said it's the hallmark of an outstanding maid.
d_ex_tower_08_36,Whoa! That's so cool!
d_ex_tower_08_37,Does that mean Trony can use maid power too?
d_ex_tower_08_38,I can't yet...
d_ex_tower_08_39,"And I don't even want to, anyway."
d_ex_tower_08_40,Don't talk like that!
d_ex_tower_08_41,Huh?
d_ex_tower_08_42,Maid power sounds awesome!
d_ex_tower_08_43,I want you to be able to use it.
d_ex_tower_08_44,...
d_ex_tower_08_45,"If you can connect to the Commander using maid power,"
d_ex_tower_08_46,I could use that signal to install BOOM in the Commander's head!
d_ex_tower_08_47,?!
d_ex_tower_08_48,!
d_ex_tower_08_49,Then would Master be able to use the signal too?
d_ex_tower_08_50,Hmm... That might be difficult.
d_ex_tower_08_51,Since BOOM is a single player game.
d_ex_tower_08_52,"However, if we install the multiplayer feature..."
d_ex_tower_08_53,"I don't want any features, single or multiplayer."
d_ex_tower_08_54,"... Anchor, how do you use maid power?"
d_ex_tower_08_55,"Ah hah! I knew you'd be willing to help out, Trony!"
d_ex_tower_08_56,We're not installing BOOM in the Commander. It'd break him.
d_ex_tower_08_57,"I appreciate the concern, Trony."
d_ex_tower_08_58,"But if I'm able to harness maid power,"
d_ex_tower_08_59,I think I could... be able to communicate with him more easily.
d_ex_tower_08_60,*Grab*
d_ex_tower_08_61,*Gasp*
d_ex_tower_08_62,Anchor grasps Trony's hand.
d_ex_tower_08_63,We can practice together.
d_ex_tower_08_64,I'll help you.
d_ex_tower_08_65,!
d_ex_tower_08_66,O-okay!
d_ex_tower_08_67,"First, I'll teach you how to walk Starfish."
d_ex_tower_08_68,...
d_ex_tower_08_69,Huh?
d_ex_tower_08_70,"Next, you'll learn how to understand how a sea cucumber is feeling."
d_ex_tower_08_71,They can be pretty moody and hard to understand at times.
d_ex_tower_08_72,Wh-what is this?
d_ex_tower_08_73,I knew Anchor was a true professional.
d_ex_tower_08_74,"If you follow her lead, Trony, you'll become an outstanding maid in no time."
d_ex_tower_08_75,A-are you actually being serious?
d_ex_tower_08_76,Of course I am!
d_ex_tower_08_77,...
d_ex_tower_08_78,"Don't worry, Master."
d_ex_tower_08_79,I'll take good care of Trony.
d_ex_tower_08_80,... Just don't go too hard on her.
d_ex_tower_08_81,Sure thing.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_title,A Walk With Friends
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_1,"I have some free time, and so I've decided to take a walk."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_2,?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_3,"As I'm walking, I see something that makes me question my own eyesight."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_4,*Blink*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_5,"No matter how many times I blink, the scene before me remains unchanged."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_6,Huh?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_7,It's a lion...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_8,"Hey, Zoo Keeper!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_9,"Hello, Master."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_10,Two Nikkes...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_11,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_12,"And a starfish, all enjoying a leisurely stroll together."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_13,Hey.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_14,"... What are you doing, exactly?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_15,We're taking Timi for a walk.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_16,... I see a starfish is tagging along as well?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_17,?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_18,"Anchor has a leash in one hand, the other end of which is tied to a starfish."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_19,"Yeah, I'm taking this little guy for a walk."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_20,"Wow, a walking starfish!"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_21,... Hold up. Is that even possible?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_22,Sure it is.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_23,This one at least is walkable.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_24,No wonder it looked livelier than the others.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_25,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_26,"Looking closely, I notice that the starfish is slowly inching forward."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_27,*Graul*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_28,"No no, Timi."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_29,You need to match your friend's pace.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_30,*Graul*?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_31,I didn't realize you two were good friends.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_32,We've spoken a few times.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_33,"Since the weather is nice today, Timi and I went for a walk, and we ended up running into Anchor and her little friend."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_34,"I must say, I've never seen someone take a starfish for a walk before."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_35,Neither have I.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_36,I don't think many people have.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_37,*Graul*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_38,Oh my.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_39,What is it?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_40,"Anchor, could you pet Timi?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_41,Sure.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_42,Anchor gently pats Timi's head.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_43,*Graul*!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_44,Seems like he enjoys it.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_45,"Yeah, Timi's a fan of Anchor."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_46,*Pat pat*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_47,Anchor continues to pet Timi for a while.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_48,"It's not exactly squishy, but"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_49,I think it'll do.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_50,*Graul*!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_51,He wants you to pet him more.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_52,No problemo!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_53,*Pet pet pet pet pet pet pet*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_54,*Graul*... *Graul*...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_55,Could I pet your starfish too?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_56,Sure. Here.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_57,Anchor picks up the starfish with both hands.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_58,*Squish*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_59,"Whoa, it's such a strange feeling."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_60,Zzzz...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_61,Timi seems tired.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_62,"Timi, you can't sleep here. Get up."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_63,"Now. Say goodbye to your friend, and let's head back."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_64,Leona brings the starfish she is holding towards Timi's face.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_65,*Chomp*
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_66,!?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_67,!?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_68,Timi!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_69,?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_70,Timi suddenly bites down on the starfish.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_71,"Leona hurriedly pries open Timi's mouth, retrieves the starfish, and bows apologetically to Anchor."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_72,I'm so sorry about that!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_73,"It's Timi's first time seeing a starfish, so he must have mistaken it for food instead of a friend."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_74,It's okay. It's not hurt.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_75,And it didn't get scared at all.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_76,Even though it went straight into a lion's mouth?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_77,Yeah.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_78,"During the day, starfish like to remain in the sunlight,"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_79,"but at night, they prefer dark places, like spots under rocks and in other crevices."
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_80,It just told me it liked being in Timi's mouth because it was dark and cozy inside.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_81,*Graul*?
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_82,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_83,Well... I guess that makes sense.
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_84,"In that case, would it like to hang out in Timi's mouth while we head back?"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_85,Sure!
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_86,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_87,...
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_88,"And so, the already thoroughly bizarre stroll"
d_ex_wingofvictory_09_89,ended with a lion becoming a temporary carriage for a starfish.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_title,A Small Sanctuary in the Outpost
d_ex_flowerpark_01_1,Hmm?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_2,"Blossom, is that you?"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_3,Hello.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_4,"Oh my,"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_5,I was wondering who it was.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_6,What are you doing here?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_7,Just passing by.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_8,What are you up to?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_9,I'm tending to the park.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_10,We're going to be taking greater care of this place in the future.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_11,Why's that?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_12,"In essence, we're helping the flowers adapt to potential weather patterns they'd see up on the surface."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_13,"The garden provides an ideal environment for the flowers,"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_14,but they can't stay in a greenhouse forever.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_15,"So, we started by moving the strongest ones here."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_16,"And while we're at it,"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_17,we thought we might as well make the experience more comfortable
d_ex_flowerpark_01_18,for both the flowers and park visitors.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_19,A small sanctuary in the Outpost.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_20,"Hehe, I guess you could think of it like that."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_21,Is there anything I can help with?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_22,You're so kind.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_23,"I appreciate your offering, but we're wrapping things up here."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_24,"We'll be done soon, so would you be willing to wait for me?"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_25,Sure.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_26,Just let me know if you need a hand.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_27,"Hehe, sure."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_28,"Let's finish up, Trina."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_29,Okay.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_30,"So,"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_31,"Tulip, how does your new home feel?"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_32,Hmm?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_33,The soil feels a little uncomfortable?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_34,"Hmm, okay. Let me help you with that."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_35,Hmm...
d_ex_flowerpark_01_36,This part is completely wilted.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_37,"This will sting a little, so bear with me, okay?"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_38,"Good, that's it."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_39,*Slide*
d_ex_flowerpark_01_40,I step aside to avoid disturbing Trina and Flora.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_41,You two are really in your element.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_42,The park feels much more vibrant than before.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_43,It's as if new life has been breathed into it.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_44,*Rustle*
d_ex_flowerpark_01_45,?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_46,"As I turn my head, I see a small flower near my foot."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_47,Hmm...
d_ex_flowerpark_01_48,Hello there. What's your name?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_49,You must be awfully bored here all by yourself.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_50,...
d_ex_flowerpark_01_51,You seem lonely.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_52,I'll move you over there.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_53,Hahaha.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_54,What a heartwarming sight.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_55,??
d_ex_flowerpark_01_56,"Hehe, absolutely."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_57,"I feel oddly proud, in fact."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_58,Hee hee.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_59,Hee hee.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_60,Are you two done with your work?
d_ex_flowerpark_01_61,"Yep, all done!"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_62,That was fast.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_63,We'd gotten the bulk of it done by the time you arrived.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_64,"You weren't too bored waiting for us, were you?"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_65,Not at all.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_66,It felt like I'd stepped away from the city for a moment.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_67,Hehe.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_68,Lovely!
d_ex_flowerpark_01_69,It seems like we've already succeeded in what we wanted to achieve.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_70,Indeed.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_71,"If our first visitor feels that way,"
d_ex_flowerpark_01_72,I can only imagine how everyone else will feel.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_73,"I should bring the other Nikkes here, from time to time."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_74,That'd be great!
d_ex_flowerpark_01_75,You'll have to let us know how they feel about it.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_76,I certainly will.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_77,Haha.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_78,"I can't wait to hear about all the wonderful experiences you'll have in this park, Blossom."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_79,"We've put a lot of care into this place, so please enjoy it to the fullest."
d_ex_flowerpark_01_80,Be sure to visit often.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_81,The little ones will be excited to see you and everyone else.
d_ex_flowerpark_01_82,"I'll be sure to visit often, promise."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_title,The Wandering Spirit of the Park
d_ex_flowerpark_02_1,"Oh! Teacher, you're here!"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_2,"Hello, Teacher."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_3,Hi.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_4,Why did you ask me to meet you here?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_5,Haven't you heard?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_6,I thought you'd notice right away when you got here.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_7,Hear what?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_8,It's been trending all over the internet for a few days now.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_9,"Ein, I told you that's all made up."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_10,There's no way a ghost would appear in broad daylight.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_11,"That's what makes it so fun! The less proof there is, the more intriguing it is!"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_12,"Did you say ""ghost""?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_13,Yeah.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_14,"Every night,"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_15,a ghost who met an unjust end
d_ex_flowerpark_02_16,is said to wander through this park.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_17,"She walks around stark naked,"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_18,and sings an eerie song that goes something like this:
d_ex_flowerpark_02_19,Laa dee dah...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_20,Laa doo dee...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_21,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_22,"You're not scared, are you, Zwei?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_23,I don't believe in ghosts.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_24,"Anyway, that's the gist."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_25,"What do you think, Teacher?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_26,It's obviously not real.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_27,Sounds interesting.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_28,"A very level-headed answer, as to be expected from you, Teacher."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_29,C'mon you guys.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_30,"Even if ghosts aren't real, there's nothing wrong with building up a little atmosphere."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_31,"Not you too, Teacher..."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_32,I knew it!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_33,"I knew you'd get into it, Teacher."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_34,If all you're gonna do is keep talking nonsen...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_35,Sssh! Quiet!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_36,Did you hear that?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_37,Laa dee dah...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_38,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_39,"Stop it, Ein."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_40,Laa dee dah...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_41,Laa doo dee...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_42,What are you all doing here?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_43,!!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_44,Gaaaaah! It's a ghost!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_45,"He-help us, Teacher!"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_46,"Hi, Trina."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_47,I-it's a ghost!!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_48,Hmm?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_49,What's going on here?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_50,I explain the situation to Trina.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_51,"Oh, I see..."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_52,"A ghost that wanders around naked, cackling."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_53,Yeesh. Gives me chills just thinking about it.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_54,There can't be something like that in the park... can there?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_55,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_56,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_57,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_58,"Trina, was it?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_59,Sorry about earlier.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_60,I didn't realize you were the one taking care of this place.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_61,"Yeah, I should apologize as well."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_62,"Don't worry. Your head was filled with scary ghost stories,"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_63,so it's only natural that you'd be a bit on edge.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_64,There's no need to feel guilty.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_65,I'm just glad you're not upset.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_66,Thanks for being so understanding.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_67,"Haha, I'm happy to see you all back in good spirits."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_68,"Ha, of course."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_69,"Well then, I'm going to get back to what I was doing."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_70,I'm not quite finished with my work yet.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_71,Okay.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_72,"Sure, we'll leave you to it."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_73,See you around.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_74,Doo dee doo...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_75,*Rustle*
d_ex_flowerpark_02_76,!!!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_77,"Turns out she's not a ghost, but just a really nice person."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_78,Yeah. I kinda feel bad that we got so freaked out.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_79,"Luckily, Ein and Zwei are wrapped up in conversation and fail to notice Trina removing her clothes."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_80,"Teacher,"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_81,maybe we should start heading...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_82,?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_83,...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_84,!!!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_85,"What's wrong, Zwei?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_86,"Zwei stares off the side, frozen in terror."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_87,Oh no...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_88,"With trepidation, I look to where Zwei's eyes have settled, and standing there is..."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_89,...!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_90,"T-Teacher,"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_91,I think I should go.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_92,I'll s-see you around.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_93,"Zwei rushes out of the park, having seen something she shouldn't have."
d_ex_flowerpark_02_94,Huh? Zwei! Where are you going?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_95,Zwei!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_96,What the... what's she in such a hurry for? We were supposed to leave together.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_97,"Huh? What are you looking at, Teacher?"
d_ex_flowerpark_02_98,W-wait!
d_ex_flowerpark_02_99,*Grab*
d_ex_flowerpark_02_100,I quickly reach out and cover Ein's eyes.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_101,Huh? What's going on?
d_ex_flowerpark_02_102,I can't see anything...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_103,I make sure Ein doesn't see what I'm seeing.
d_ex_flowerpark_02_104,Laa dee dah...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_105,Laa dee dah...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_106,Laa doo dee...
d_ex_flowerpark_02_107,"We should get out of the park quickly, before Trina comes this way."
d_ex_hotel_10_title,Paradise in the Ark
d_ex_hotel_10_1,Urgh...
d_ex_hotel_10_2,!!
d_ex_hotel_10_3,Where am I?
d_ex_hotel_10_4,Are you okay?!
d_ex_hotel_10_5,"Commander, are you awake?"
d_ex_hotel_10_6,What am I doing here...?
d_ex_hotel_10_7,Do you not remember?
d_ex_hotel_10_8,Trina and I found you collapsed at the Outpost.
d_ex_hotel_10_9,Are you okay?
d_ex_hotel_10_10,You don't look so good.
d_ex_hotel_10_11,I have stayed up two nights in a row...
d_ex_hotel_10_12,Oh my goodness! Two whole nights?
d_ex_hotel_10_13,Whatever for?
d_ex_hotel_10_14,I've got a pretty nasty backlog of paperwork to handle.
d_ex_hotel_10_15,I expected that's what you'd say.
d_ex_hotel_10_16,Huh? Does this happen often?
d_ex_hotel_10_17,"Not often necessarily, but certainly every once in a while."
d_ex_hotel_10_18,!!
d_ex_hotel_10_19,"You can't be doing that, Sun."
d_ex_hotel_10_20,You have to make sure to eat and sleep properly.
d_ex_hotel_10_21,"I know, I know."
d_ex_hotel_10_22,But what did you bring me here for?
d_ex_hotel_10_23,"If we took you back to the Commander's Room, you'd get right back to overworking yourself."
d_ex_hotel_10_24,"We wanted to make sure you get some proper rest, at least for today."
d_ex_hotel_10_25,It sounds like you've been running yourself ragged.
d_ex_hotel_10_26,"Okay, fine. I'll take it easy today."
d_ex_hotel_10_27,Good!
d_ex_hotel_10_28,Very good!
d_ex_hotel_10_29,...
d_ex_hotel_10_30,Neither of them are leaving.
d_ex_hotel_10_31,?
d_ex_hotel_10_32,"Well, aren't you going to let me rest?"
d_ex_hotel_10_33,"Yes, but not in the way you apparently expected."
d_ex_hotel_10_34,We're going to help you relax.
d_ex_hotel_10_35,"Okay, but how?"
d_ex_hotel_10_36,Do you remember the aromatherapy I gave you before?
d_ex_hotel_10_37,*Slide*
d_ex_hotel_10_38,Emma produces a bag and takes out a glass bottle filled with liquid.
d_ex_hotel_10_39,*Clink*
d_ex_hotel_10_40,Hmm?
d_ex_hotel_10_41,"Oh dear, this isn't good."
d_ex_hotel_10_42,I barely have any oil left.
d_ex_hotel_10_43,This isn't even enough for an upper body massage.
d_ex_hotel_10_44,"How about this, Emma?"
d_ex_hotel_10_45,Would this work?
d_ex_hotel_10_46,"From her pocket, Trina takes out a glass bottle filled with yellow liquid."
d_ex_hotel_10_47,What's that?
d_ex_hotel_10_48,Oil extracted from the herbs in the garden.
d_ex_hotel_10_49,"Ooh, fascinating."
d_ex_hotel_10_50,I've never seen handmade oil before.
d_ex_hotel_10_51,Would you be able to use this?
d_ex_hotel_10_52,"Of course I could. In fact, I think it might smell even better than what I have here."
d_ex_hotel_10_53,"Now then, shall we get started?"
d_ex_hotel_10_54,*Rustle rustle*
d_ex_hotel_10_55,"Feeling comfortable, Sun?"
d_ex_hotel_10_56,"Er... yeah, sure."
d_ex_hotel_10_57,"I'm lying down, with my face on Trina's lap."
d_ex_hotel_10_58,*Press press*
d_ex_hotel_10_59,Let's see... is this how you do it?
d_ex_hotel_10_60,*Press*
d_ex_hotel_10_61,I can feel the pressure from fingers pressing into my lower body as well.
d_ex_hotel_10_62,"Hehe, nicely done!"
d_ex_hotel_10_63,You're pretty good for someone who just picked this up.
d_ex_hotel_10_64,"Hehe, you're making me blush."
d_ex_hotel_10_65,This can be a bit difficult to do solo.
d_ex_hotel_10_66,Having a partner makes it much easier.
d_ex_hotel_10_67,"Maybe we should get into business together, haha."
d_ex_hotel_10_68,*Slide slide slide*
d_ex_hotel_10_69,The fragrant scent of herb oil spreads through the air as gentle hands glide over my body.
d_ex_hotel_10_70,"If there was such a thing as paradise in the Ark, this would be it."
d_ex_hotel_10_71,My eyes start to close.
d_ex_hotel_10_72,Looks like you're getting sleepy.
d_ex_hotel_10_73,"If you're feeling drowsy, feel free to doze off."
d_ex_hotel_10_74,Absolutely.
d_ex_hotel_10_75,Today is a day where you can relax without having a care in the world.
d_ex_hotel_10_76,I think I'll take you up on that offer.
d_ex_hotel_10_77,...
d_ex_hotel_10_78,"A pungent, burning smell assaults my nostrils."
d_ex_hotel_10_79,Is there a fire?
d_ex_hotel_10_80,...?
d_ex_hotel_10_81,"Wow, what an interesting color."
d_ex_hotel_10_82,It looks just like the nutrient-rich soil my plants love.
d_ex_hotel_10_83,"Ha, you've got a good eye."
d_ex_hotel_10_84,This is a nutritious porridge filled with all sorts of lovely ingredients.
d_ex_hotel_10_85,"I made a whole bunch, so I was planning on sharing it,"
d_ex_hotel_10_86,and this is the perfect opportunity.
d_ex_hotel_10_87,...
d_ex_hotel_10_88,Is this stuff good for you when you're feeling tired?
d_ex_hotel_10_89,Absolutely!
d_ex_hotel_10_90,"If you need, I can write down the recipe for you."
d_ex_hotel_10_91,Thanks! You're so nice.
d_ex_hotel_10_92,...
d_ex_hotel_10_93,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_10_94,Sun is still asleep.
d_ex_hotel_10_95,He must have really been exhausted.
d_ex_hotel_10_96,Seems that way.
d_ex_hotel_10_97,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_10_98,What if we feed him a bit of the porridge? Do you think that would wake him?
d_ex_hotel_10_99,!!!
d_ex_hotel_10_100,Do you really think that's a good idea?
d_ex_hotel_10_101,"Hehe, I was only kidding."
d_ex_hotel_10_102,"If we did that, he could end up choking."
d_ex_hotel_10_103,He can have some when he wakes up.
d_ex_hotel_10_104,Okay.
d_ex_hotel_10_105,Why don't we sit here and wait? He should be waking up soon.
d_ex_hotel_10_106,That's a great idea!
d_ex_hotel_10_107,"Trina and Emma sit down next to me, watching with eager anticipation."
d_ex_hotel_10_108,He's gonna be so surprised when he sees what you've made!
d_ex_hotel_10_109,That's right! I'm excited too.
d_ex_hotel_10_110,Hehe!
d_ex_hotel_10_111,Haha!
d_ex_hotel_10_112,...
d_ex_hotel_10_113,I think I should keep my eyes shut.
d_ex_hotel_10_114,"In fact, it'd probably be best to try and sleep through until tomorrow morning."
d_ex_hotel_11_title,The Taste of Room Service
d_ex_hotel_11_1,"Wow, this is my first time setting foot inside a hotel."
d_ex_hotel_11_2,It's much bigger than I expected. And nicer.
d_ex_hotel_11_3,"Yes, it's very nice."
d_ex_hotel_11_4,"It's too bad that we can't use the Commander's Room, what with all the construction going on there."
d_ex_hotel_11_5,"Having said that,"
d_ex_hotel_11_6,this place makes for a very satisfying substitute.
d_ex_hotel_11_7,It's awfully quiet here as well.
d_ex_hotel_11_8,This was the only place suitable for keeping my promise.
d_ex_hotel_11_9,"Okay,"
d_ex_hotel_11_10,go and wash your hands.
d_ex_hotel_11_11,*Slurp*...
d_ex_hotel_11_12,I'm famished.
d_ex_hotel_11_13,Sure thing. I'll be right back.
d_ex_hotel_11_14,*Swoosh*
d_ex_hotel_11_15,"The aforementioned promise, one which I had postponed no less than three times, was to allow Bready to have a taste of my hands."
d_ex_hotel_11_16,"I couldn't in good conscience stall any longer, so we left my office, which was currently under construction, and instead came to the hotel together."
d_ex_hotel_11_17,It's a bit uncomfortable with you watching me...
d_ex_hotel_11_18,*Swoosh*
d_ex_hotel_11_19,"Bonne Bouche, how much longer are you going to wash your hands for?"
d_ex_hotel_11_20,"At this rate, you're going to rub them raw."
d_ex_hotel_11_21,I'm coming.
d_ex_hotel_11_22,"Oh yes, you washed them quite thoroughly."
d_ex_hotel_11_23,They look delicious.
d_ex_hotel_11_24,Time to dig in!
d_ex_hotel_11_25,Ahhhh...
d_ex_hotel_11_26,*Knock* *Knock*
d_ex_hotel_11_27,Huh?
d_ex_hotel_11_28,Who could that be? There wasn't anyone else here when we arrived.
d_ex_hotel_11_29,Yeah... That's strange.
d_ex_hotel_11_30,Who is it?
d_ex_hotel_11_31,...
d_ex_hotel_11_32,No response.
d_ex_hotel_11_33,I'll go check.
d_ex_hotel_11_34,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_11_35,"Oh,"
d_ex_hotel_11_36,it's room service.
d_ex_hotel_11_37,The smell alone tells me that it's going to taste amazing.
d_ex_hotel_11_38,"Did you order this, Bonne Bouche?"
d_ex_hotel_11_39,"No, I didn't..."
d_ex_hotel_11_40,Really?
d_ex_hotel_11_41,Hmm.
d_ex_hotel_11_42,Should we take it?
d_ex_hotel_11_43,"It was left in front of our door, so it must be meant for us."
d_ex_hotel_11_44,You think so?
d_ex_hotel_11_45,"All right, I guess it's a complimentary service."
d_ex_hotel_11_46,*Slide*
d_ex_hotel_11_47,"Wow, these portions are rather prodigious. Looks amazing!"
d_ex_hotel_11_48,"However,"
d_ex_hotel_11_49,I still want to taste you first.
d_ex_hotel_11_50,This can be our dessert later.
d_ex_hotel_11_51,"Now,"
d_ex_hotel_11_52,where was I?
d_ex_hotel_11_53,Ahhhh...
d_ex_hotel_11_54,*Knock* *Knock*
d_ex_hotel_11_55,...?
d_ex_hotel_11_56,Again?
d_ex_hotel_11_57,*Zing*
d_ex_hotel_11_58,"This time, it's alcohol."
d_ex_hotel_11_59,Why didn't they just bring everything at once?
d_ex_hotel_11_60,"There's a note too, ""Enjoy the food while it's warm."""
d_ex_hotel_11_61,Seems they want us to eat the food before doing anything else.
d_ex_hotel_11_62,"What do you think, Bonne Bouche?"
d_ex_hotel_11_63,"I am a bit hungry, so let's eat first."
d_ex_hotel_11_64,"All right, sounds good."
d_ex_hotel_11_65,"We don't know what may be in the food though, so why don't you let me taste it first?"
d_ex_hotel_11_66,"I don't think it's been tampered with, but if you insist."
d_ex_hotel_11_67,"All right, here I go."
d_ex_hotel_11_68,*Nom*
d_ex_hotel_11_69,...
d_ex_hotel_11_70,How is it? Does it taste okay?
d_ex_hotel_11_71,...
d_ex_hotel_11_72,Hmm.
d_ex_hotel_11_73,"There's no issue with the taste itself,"
d_ex_hotel_11_74,but I'd wager whoever made this
d_ex_hotel_11_75,is more skilled in other areas than cooking.
d_ex_hotel_11_76,Do you come to this hotel often?
d_ex_hotel_11_77,Not really.
d_ex_hotel_11_78,Good.
d_ex_hotel_11_79,"I don't know who's in charge of this hotel,"
d_ex_hotel_11_80,but it's probably best not to get too involved.
d_ex_hotel_11_81,Hmm...
d_ex_hotel_11_82,"It seems that someone is going out of their way to prevent me from tasting you,"
d_ex_hotel_11_83,so I guess I'll settle for room service today.
d_ex_hotel_11_84,Are you okay with that?
d_ex_hotel_11_85,Sure.
d_ex_hotel_11_86,"It's been a while since I've experienced these kinds of flavors and the story behind them. It's rather enjoyable, actually."
d_ex_hotel_11_87,"Enjoyable, you say?"
d_ex_hotel_11_88,"Anyway, let's eat."
d_ex_hotel_11_89,All right.
d_ex_hotel_11_90,Bon appétit.
d_ex_hotel_11_91,"After devouring the food down to the last bite,"
d_ex_hotel_11_92,Bready and I safely leave the hotel and head back to our respective residences.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_title,The Flavor of Flower Stories
d_ex_flowerpark_03_1,"Ah, Blossom!"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_2,You've arrived.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_3,"And you as well, Chicory."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_4,Chicory? I'm pretty sure I've heard of that before.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_5,It's a leafy plant which is also edible.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_6,It can be cooked in various ways.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_7,She started calling me after the flower that blooms from it.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_8,Why's that? Does its symbolism fit Bready's personality?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_9,Chicory stands for thriftiness and frugality.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_10,Er... that doesn't really sound like a good match.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_11,"Chicory tastes bitter, but it's very healthy."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_12,It therefore carries the meaning of finding truth within bitterness.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_13,"Apparently, Flora feels that's an apt description of me."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_14,That's right.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_15,Chicory's true ability lies elsewhere.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_16,"As she speaks, Flora points to Bready's tongue."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_17,So you know about Bready's unique abilities.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_18,All of our squad members do.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_19,Botanic Garden and Cooking Oil support each other in many ways.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_20,"After all, a lot of food ingredients come from plants."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_21,We often receive help from them in that regard.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_22,And what does Botanic Garden get in return?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_23,We ask them for information about plants that we don't understand.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_24,Just like today.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_25,You mean to tell me there are plants that Botanic Garden isn't familiar with?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_26,Of course there are.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_27,"Flora lifts a small pot, inside of which a tiny sprout is emerging."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_28,This is a newly discovered flower
d_ex_flowerpark_03_29,which we've been unable to identify.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_30,"Before they are nurtured into maturity, plants are full of mystery."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_31,"We have no idea where it grew, what kind of life it's led, or whether it's poisonous or not."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_32,"If we raised it incorrectly, this plant could potentially be harmful."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_33,That's why our first course of action is to consult Chicory.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_34,I see.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_35,Let me give it a taste.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_36,*Lick*
d_ex_flowerpark_03_37,Hmm...
d_ex_flowerpark_03_38,"You found it in a cold region, didn't you?"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_39,"Yes, that's right."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_40,That's why we've been keeping it in the coldest environment possible.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_41,"Actually, this plant only managed to survive in cold climates due to its resilience."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_42,"Fortunately, there was enough sunlight in that area to allow it to sprout."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_43,It would actually be better to move it somewhere warmer.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_44,Oh my goodness!
d_ex_flowerpark_03_45,"Here it was, struggling to make it through the cold, and then we came along and left it somewhere even colder."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_46,I feel so bad.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_47,"Unfortunately, it's not edible, either."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_48,We won't have much use for it at Cooking Oil.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_49,"It isn't highly poisonous though,"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_50,so it should be safe to grow alongside other plants.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_51,It's also very happy that you found it.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_52,Yes...
d_ex_flowerpark_03_53,I can sense that emotion as well.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_54,"I found it in the middle of a raging blizzard, huddled at the base of a cliff, trembling."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_55,"The moment I realized it was alive, I felt so relieved."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_56,That's about all I can discern for now.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_57,"You'll learn more as you continue to care for it, Flora."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_58,That's more than enough.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_59,Thank you so much.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_60,Are you sure it's okay to be cultivating a new species here?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_61,It'll be fine.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_62,This little one is lonely.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_63,"That's why I thought the best place to raise it would be here, where people often come to visit."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_64,"By the way, what are you considering naming it?"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_65,Hmm...
d_ex_flowerpark_03_66,I'll decide
d_ex_flowerpark_03_67,once I've raised it and it blossoms.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_68,I'm curious to know what you'll name it.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_69,Looks like I'll be busy for a while.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_70,"Could you help me, Blossom?"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_71,What do you need me to do?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_72,"Flowers love you, Blossom."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_73,"Much like me, they are drawn to your pleasant fragrance and calming presence."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_74,"If you spend time with this little one,"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_75,I'm sure it will be overjoyed.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_76,I don't know... Are you sure I'm right for the job?
d_ex_flowerpark_03_77,Of course you are!
d_ex_flowerpark_03_78,"Give it water, talk to it, and sing to it."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_79,"Bready, would you like to join me?"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_80,"Sorry, Bonne Bouche, but my role here is done."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_81,Now it's your turn.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_82,...
d_ex_flowerpark_03_83,"Are you all right, Blossom?"
d_ex_flowerpark_03_84,Yeah... I'll do my best.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_85,"Well, I'll be off."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_86,Call me if you need me.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_87,"Sure thing, Chicory, and the same to you."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_88,Thank you for your help today.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_89,You bet.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_90,I spend a long time conversing with the nameless flower.
d_ex_flowerpark_03_91,"... Or talking to it, rather."
d_ex_flowerpark_03_92,Only once the flower has fallen asleep am I able to leave the garden.
d_ex_trainstation_09_title,Gourmet Train Journey
d_ex_trainstation_09_1,"Diesel, they're coming today, right?"
d_ex_trainstation_09_2,That's right.
d_ex_trainstation_09_3,"It's been a while since I've seen you this excited, Soline."
d_ex_trainstation_09_4,The quality of our food select...
d_ex_trainstation_09_5,"Er... I mean, the quality of the AZX itself is gonna improve!"
d_ex_trainstation_09_6,How could I not be excited?
d_ex_trainstation_09_7,"Hehe, that's true."
d_ex_trainstation_09_8,What are you guys talking about?
d_ex_trainstation_09_9,"Oh, hi, Commander. I didn't see you."
d_ex_trainstation_09_10,Commander?
d_ex_trainstation_09_11,"If you're here, then where's..."
d_ex_trainstation_09_12,*Clatter*
d_ex_trainstation_09_13,Hello!
d_ex_trainstation_09_14,Sorry that we're a little late.
d_ex_trainstation_09_15,Hey there.
d_ex_trainstation_09_16,"Welcome, Crust. Welcome, Bready."
d_ex_trainstation_09_17,Do you have anything for us?
d_ex_trainstation_09_18,We sure do!
d_ex_trainstation_09_19,"A whole bevy of food options, designed to be consumed easily onboard the train, just as you requested."
d_ex_trainstation_09_20,I spent a lot of time making them.
d_ex_trainstation_09_21,And I spent a lot of time tasting them.
d_ex_trainstation_09_22,"Personally, I recommend the AZX Iron Rails Lunchbox Set."
d_ex_trainstation_09_23,Sounds promising.
d_ex_trainstation_09_24,May I take a look?
d_ex_trainstation_09_25,Of course!
d_ex_trainstation_09_26,Crust rolls a serving cart over to Diesel and Soline.
d_ex_trainstation_09_27,"Six special lunchboxes, each with AZX-inspired names."
d_ex_trainstation_09_28,"Four types of bread, all molded in various railway-themed shapes."
d_ex_trainstation_09_29,"As for the water and drinks, we kept those as is."
d_ex_trainstation_09_30,What do you think?
d_ex_trainstation_09_31,It's perfect.
d_ex_trainstation_09_32,Just looking at them makes my mouth water.
d_ex_trainstation_09_33,"I do have a question, though."
d_ex_trainstation_09_34,"This train isn't in operation, right?"
d_ex_trainstation_09_35,So why do you need food options?
d_ex_trainstation_09_36,We wanted visitors coming to see the AZX to experience the feeling of actually riding a train.
d_ex_trainstation_09_37,Simply sitting in a chair and listening to explanations can make for a boring tour.
d_ex_trainstation_09_38,"We figured visitors might get hungry,"
d_ex_trainstation_09_39,so we wanted to create a special dining experience unique to the AZX.
d_ex_trainstation_09_40,I see.
d_ex_trainstation_09_41,That's a great idea.
d_ex_trainstation_09_42,I appreciate you saying that!
d_ex_trainstation_09_43,...
d_ex_trainstation_09_44,Soline?
d_ex_trainstation_09_45,Huh? Did someone say my name?
d_ex_trainstation_09_46,You don't seem too happy. Are you okay?
d_ex_trainstation_09_47,Wh-what are you talking about?
d_ex_trainstation_09_48,I'm over the moon. The AZX finally has its own unique dining options.
d_ex_trainstation_09_49,"Ah, that reminds me!"
d_ex_trainstation_09_50,I haven't introduced all the food yet.
d_ex_trainstation_09_51,May I present to you...
d_ex_trainstation_09_52,The snacks!
d_ex_trainstation_09_53,!!
d_ex_trainstation_09_54,"Oh, thank goodness!"
d_ex_trainstation_09_55,I was starting to get worried that there'd only be full meals and no snacks.
d_ex_trainstation_09_56,"Hehe, sorry if you got stressed out for a second."
d_ex_trainstation_09_57,"Now then, allow me to explain what we have on offer:"
d_ex_trainstation_09_58,Four types of AZX-shaped cookies.
d_ex_trainstation_09_59,Ten types of candy inspired by track ballast.
d_ex_trainstation_09_60,And a special item specifically requested from Diesel...
d_ex_trainstation_09_61,We used the AZX's very own Choo Choo Splendamin to create this Choo Choo Ice Cream!
d_ex_trainstation_09_62,"The lunchboxes are my favorite, but this is a close second."
d_ex_trainstation_09_63,"Want to try one, Soline?"
d_ex_trainstation_09_64,Er...
d_ex_trainstation_09_65,I'm not really into sweet things.
d_ex_trainstation_09_66,But...
d_ex_trainstation_09_67,if you insist.
d_ex_trainstation_09_68,"While we're at it,"
d_ex_trainstation_09_69,would you all like to sample these while sitting inside the AZX?
d_ex_trainstation_09_70,Food always tastes better when eaten in the proper setting.
d_ex_trainstation_09_71,Wow! Can we really?
d_ex_trainstation_09_72,We'd love that.
d_ex_trainstation_09_73,You're so right. Where you eat food can drastically change its flavor.
d_ex_trainstation_09_74,Let's go.
d_ex_trainstation_09_75,Inside AZX.
d_ex_trainstation_09_76,"All right, everyone, dig in."
d_ex_trainstation_09_77,"Oh boy, this looks so good!"
d_ex_trainstation_09_78,Bon appétit!
d_ex_trainstation_09_79,Bon appétit!
d_ex_trainstation_09_80,"Seated comfortably, we each place our chosen items on the table,"
d_ex_trainstation_09_81,and start tasting.
d_ex_trainstation_09_82,Mmm...
d_ex_trainstation_09_83,It really does feel different.
d_ex_trainstation_09_84,Eating this in the setting where it was meant to be consumed really brings out the flavor.
d_ex_trainstation_09_85,Absolutely. It didn't taste this way at all when I was making it.
d_ex_trainstation_09_86,"Mmm. I'm so glad we asked for your help, Crust."
d_ex_trainstation_09_87,"I could be full to bursting, and still want to pack away more."
d_ex_trainstation_09_88,*Lick* *Lick*
d_ex_trainstation_09_89,So good.
d_ex_trainstation_09_90,"This is the special item you requested, isn't it, Diesel?"
d_ex_trainstation_09_91,That's right.
d_ex_trainstation_09_92,"I usually don't like sweet things, but this is seriously good!"
d_ex_trainstation_09_93,Glad you like it!
d_ex_trainstation_09_94,Can I have a bite too?
d_ex_trainstation_09_95,Be my guest.
d_ex_trainstation_09_96,*Lick*
d_ex_trainstation_09_97,!!
d_ex_trainstation_09_98,"The wonderful cooling sensation, combined with the perfect mix of flavors..."
d_ex_trainstation_09_99,It's really delicious. Hehe.
d_ex_trainstation_09_100,"Seems like we have two satisfied customers, hehe."
d_ex_trainstation_09_101,We certainly do.
d_ex_trainstation_09_102,You did a great job.
d_ex_trainstation_09_103,I might come to the station more often just to eat this.
d_ex_trainstation_09_104,"Hehe, invite us to come along next time you do."
d_ex_trainstation_09_105,That'd be great.
d_ex_trainstation_09_106,Having a meal on a train for the first time was such a unique experience.
d_ex_trainstation_09_107,I won't be forgetting these flavors anytime soon.
d_ex_trainstation_09_108,"For a while, we continue sharing our food and chatting,"
d_ex_trainstation_09_109,just like passengers on an actual train journey.
d_ex_tower_09_title,The One Who Ordered the Lunchbox
d_ex_tower_09_1,"As I pass by the Radio Tower, I hear someone shouting."
d_ex_tower_09_2,Is anyone there?!
d_ex_tower_09_3,?
d_ex_tower_09_4,Did anyone order a lunchbox?
d_ex_tower_09_5,Who could that be?
d_ex_tower_09_6,"Upon further investigation, it turns out the person in question shouting is..."
d_ex_tower_09_7,"L-lunchbox... huff, huff..."
d_ex_tower_09_8,"If it gets cold, it won't taste as good..."
d_ex_tower_09_9,Crust? What are you doing here?
d_ex_tower_09_10,Mr... Mr. Gourmand... phew...
d_ex_tower_09_11,Why don't we give you a minute to catch your breath first?
d_ex_tower_09_12,"After waiting for Crust to calm down, she regales me with the whole story."
d_ex_tower_09_13,You're delivering lunchboxes?
d_ex_tower_09_14,Yes. We're currently offering deliveries for residents of the Outpost.
d_ex_tower_09_15,I received an order for one Extra-Large Meat Lover's Lunchbox and one Premium Elegance Lunchbox.
d_ex_tower_09_16,*Whooosh*
d_ex_tower_09_17,But I don't see anyone here.
d_ex_tower_09_18,"I know. I've been calling out, but no one's shown up."
d_ex_tower_09_19,What should I do? The food will be cold in five minutes.
d_ex_tower_09_20,... Uuuut of ... ay!!!
d_ex_tower_09_21,... Did you hear something?
d_ex_tower_09_22,"Yeah, I heard it too... gah!"
d_ex_tower_09_23,Right above us!
d_ex_tower_09_24,The moment I look up...
d_ex_tower_09_25,Move ouuut of the waaay!
d_ex_tower_09_26,*BOOM!*
d_ex_tower_09_27,"A figure, having jumped down from the top of the Radio Tower, lands on the ground."
d_ex_tower_09_28,"Ooooh, lunchbox! It's the extra-large one, right?"
d_ex_tower_09_29,That's right! Here you go.
d_ex_tower_09_30,"Be sure to eat it within the next few minutes, or else it'll get cold."
d_ex_tower_09_31,That won't be a problem. I'll be able to finish this in less a min...
d_ex_tower_09_32,"Wait a minute, look who it is! Cadet!"
d_ex_tower_09_33,"Look at you, delivering a lunchbox to me."
d_ex_tower_09_34,"Wait a minute, don't tell me you made this yourself?"
d_ex_tower_09_35,No. I was simply passing by.
d_ex_tower_09_36,"Hey, Rosanna! Get down here!"
d_ex_tower_09_37,Cadet brought me a lunchbox!
d_ex_tower_09_38,*Sliiiide*
d_ex_tower_09_39,*Tap*
d_ex_tower_09_40,Rosanna grasps onto one of the radio tower's pillars with one hand and slides down smoothly.
d_ex_tower_09_41,Mister!
d_ex_tower_09_42,What a pleasant surprise.
d_ex_tower_09_43,Crust is the one who made this. I had nothing to do with it.
d_ex_tower_09_44,Hello. I'm Crust from Crunchy Cooking Class.
d_ex_tower_09_45,I brought your order.
d_ex_tower_09_46,"Oh, guess I was mistaken."
d_ex_tower_09_47,"Anyway, thanks, little lady."
d_ex_tower_09_48,Moran takes a bite from the Extra-Large Meat Lover's Lunchbox.
d_ex_tower_09_49,"Whoa, forget what I just said! You're no little lady, you're a chef! Thank you, Chef!"
d_ex_tower_09_50,I take it the taste is okay?
d_ex_tower_09_51,"I made sure to prepare it in a way so that it wouldn't lose its flavor even after cooling a bit, but..."
d_ex_tower_09_52,This is the best food I've ever eaten!
d_ex_tower_09_53,Don't be so dramatic.
d_ex_tower_09_54,Our comportment reflects that of our organizations. A leader must maintain a semblance of dignity.
d_ex_tower_09_55,"Hehe, one bite of this, and you'll change your tune."
d_ex_tower_09_56,Rosanna opens her own Premium Elegance Lunchbox and takes a bite.
d_ex_tower_09_57,"Mmm, this is quite good, actually."
d_ex_tower_09_58,Putting up with your nonsense actually paid off for once.
d_ex_tower_09_59,What are you two doing here anyway?
d_ex_tower_09_60,"*Chomp, chomp*... Surveillance."
d_ex_tower_09_61,Surveillance?
d_ex_tower_09_62,*Sigh*...
d_ex_tower_09_63,"We wouldn't want anything bad happening to you *gulp* while you're at the Outpost,"
d_ex_tower_09_64,so we're *munch munch*... Keeping an eye on you.
d_ex_tower_09_65,"Dang, that was one tasty meal."
d_ex_tower_09_66,"Much appreciated, Chef!"
d_ex_tower_09_67,I'm glad you enjoyed it!
d_ex_tower_09_68,"In other words,"
d_ex_tower_09_69,you had nothing else to do.
d_ex_tower_09_70,"No, we're conducting surveillance, I'm telling you!"
d_ex_tower_09_71,"If that's what you were really doing, there's an observation post over yonder."
d_ex_tower_09_72,Oh... Really?
d_ex_tower_09_73,...
d_ex_tower_09_74,I didn't bother telling her since I knew she wouldn't listen anyway.
d_ex_tower_09_75,At any rate.
d_ex_tower_09_76,Rosanna points at her now-empty lunchbox.
d_ex_tower_09_77,Can I order more of these?
d_ex_tower_09_78,I need a lot of them. I'm planning on sharing with my crew.
d_ex_tower_09_79,"We'll make sure you're well compensated, of course."
d_ex_tower_09_80,Absolutely! Just let me know how many you need.
d_ex_tower_09_81,And you don't have to worry about payment.
d_ex_tower_09_82,"Instead, could you help spread the word?"
d_ex_tower_09_83,"We've had a hard time promoting them, so we have a lot of extra ingredients lying around."
d_ex_tower_09_84,No problem.
d_ex_tower_09_85,"Oh, me too! I want to get some for my crew."
d_ex_tower_09_86,Can I get an Extra-Extra-Large Meat Lover's Lunchbox?
d_ex_tower_09_87,"Of course! They're custom-made, so I can prepare whatever size you need."
d_ex_tower_09_88,Then how about Extra-Extra-Extra-Large?
d_ex_tower_09_89,"Heck, I could prepare some Extra-Extra-Extra-Extra-Large ones for you all."
d_ex_tower_09_90,All right!
d_ex_tower_09_91,"Well, you two enjoy yourselves."
d_ex_tower_09_92,*Thud*
d_ex_tower_09_93,"As I turn around to leave, Rosanna grabs my shoulder."
d_ex_tower_09_94,"While we're at it, can we get one for Mister too?"
d_ex_tower_09_95,Sure thing. I'll be sure to make Mr. Gourmand's a top priority.
d_ex_tower_09_96,"Same location as before, please."
d_ex_tower_09_97,Mmm. Keeping him close makes surveillance more efficient.
d_ex_tower_09_98,...
d_ex_tower_09_99,"I'm only able to leave once Crust has come back with another lunchbox, and I've finished it."
d_ex_library_11_title,Culinary Spelling Bee Quiz Show
d_ex_library_11_1,I stop by the library to find some materials.
d_ex_library_11_2,Is Phantom not here?
d_ex_library_11_3,Phantom's usual seat is empty.
d_ex_library_11_4,"Instead, I can hear murmuring from the back room."
d_ex_library_11_5,Phantom? You here?
d_ex_library_11_6,When I step inside...
d_ex_library_11_7,Correct! Stir-fried Sausage and Vegetables!
d_ex_library_11_8,Wrong. It's Soy Garlic Chicken.
d_ex_library_11_9,Darn it...
d_ex_library_11_10,...
d_ex_library_11_11,Mr. Gourmand!
d_ex_library_11_12,You've come to rescue me!
d_ex_library_11_13,??
d_ex_library_11_14,"Hello, Monsieur. Are you looking for something?"
d_ex_library_11_15,"Yeah, but..."
d_ex_library_11_16,what are you two doing?
d_ex_library_11_17,I'm planning on publishing a cookbook.
d_ex_library_11_18,"Crust hands me a stack of papers titled ""Crunchy & Crispy! Easy cooking by Crust""."
d_ex_library_11_19,"It's my first time writing a book though,"
d_ex_library_11_20,so Phantom offered to help with editing and proofreading.
d_ex_library_11_21,...
d_ex_library_11_22,I start to flip through the pages with a sense of foreboding.
d_ex_library_11_23,*Flip*
d_ex_library_11_24,"""Here speling rong. ↑Soy Garlick very yes tasty is okaynot?"""
d_ex_library_11_25,"""↑Chang oder page beter yesyes"""
d_ex_library_11_26,"""Shorts drawing moar good. Story fokus better yesyes?"""
d_ex_library_11_27,I feel like my brain is snapping in half...
d_ex_library_11_28,Good grief...
d_ex_library_11_29,"On top of the catastrophic spelling,"
d_ex_library_11_30,there are arrows marking corrections scattered about everywhere and chaotic annotations scrawled in random positions.
d_ex_library_11_31,The result is a cryptic document that not even the world's finest codebreakers could hope to decipher.
d_ex_library_11_32,This is even worse than usual.
d_ex_library_11_33,I know... I'm ashamed.
d_ex_library_11_34,"The truth is, I've been incredibly busy lately, so I had to rush through the proofreading process."
d_ex_library_11_35,"As a result, there are a lot of shortcomings."
d_ex_library_11_36,I had planned to review and finalize everything with Crust.
d_ex_library_11_37,"Um, Mr. Gourmand..."
d_ex_library_11_38,Crust leans in and whispers to me.
d_ex_library_11_39,"I'm not in the wrong here, am I?"
d_ex_library_11_40,"No, Crust. You're in the right on this one."
d_ex_library_11_41,Phew...
d_ex_library_11_42,"Communicating remotely also complicated things, as I expected it would."
d_ex_library_11_43,That's why I came here today.
d_ex_library_11_44,But I think I'm a bit out of my depth.
d_ex_library_11_45,... I'll help.
d_ex_library_11_46,I have prior experience interpreting...
d_ex_library_11_47,"Or rather, deciphering Phantom's writing."
d_ex_library_11_48,Thank you!
d_ex_library_11_49,"Much appreciated. I don't foresee any more issues, then."
d_ex_library_11_50,And so we begin the daunting task of decrypting the abstract document.
d_ex_library_11_51,Onion!
d_ex_library_11_52,Wrong.
d_ex_library_11_53,I got it!
d_ex_library_11_54,... Lamb?
d_ex_library_11_55,Correct.
d_ex_library_11_56,Woohoo! I got it right!
d_ex_library_11_57,"Wait, but how come..."
d_ex_library_11_58,"I wrote it in a hurry, so my handwriting isn't the neatest. I could see how you thought it said ""onion""."
d_ex_library_11_59,... So what's the score now?
d_ex_library_11_60,"With that round, Crust has taken the lead."
d_ex_library_11_61,Woohoo! Just gotta keep it up!
d_ex_library_11_62,I won't lose to either of you!
d_ex_library_11_63,"I'm rooting for you, Mr. Gourmand."
d_ex_library_11_64,...
d_ex_library_11_65,Wait... why am I cheering for my opponent?
d_ex_library_11_66,Onto the next question.
d_ex_library_11_67,All right!
d_ex_library_11_68,"After struggling for quite some time, we finally manage to re-proofread Phantom's ""proofread"" version."
d_ex_library_11_69,"Phew, it's finally over..."
d_ex_library_11_70,I feel like my brain is melting.
d_ex_library_11_71,Good work. I think we're good to proceed with the first run of printing.
d_ex_library_11_72,"Thanks for all the help, Phantom. I leave the rest in your capable hands."
d_ex_library_11_73,"Ooh! Since we're all together, why don't I treat you both to dinner?"
d_ex_library_11_74,I think we're a little past dinner time.
d_ex_library_11_75,What? No way... gah!
d_ex_library_11_76,Reading the clock reveals it is nearing 11 PM.
d_ex_library_11_77,I had no idea... Didn't we start right after lunch?
d_ex_library_11_78,"Somewhere around the middle, it essentially morphed into a quiz show."
d_ex_library_11_79,Yeah. We were completely absorbed...
d_ex_library_11_80,...
d_ex_library_11_81,!!
d_ex_library_11_82,That's it!
d_ex_library_11_83,What is it?
d_ex_library_11_84,I just came up with a great idea!
d_ex_library_11_85,"Thanks again for the help, both of you. I'll treat you guys to a meal tomorrow."
d_ex_library_11_86,Crust dashes off at full speed.
d_ex_library_11_87,A few days later...
d_ex_library_11_88,A quiz segment with the audience is added to Crust's TV show.
d_ex_library_11_89,Viewership subsequently doubles.
d_ex_church_08_title,Spine-Chilling Terror
d_ex_church_08_1,As I'm passing by the church...
d_ex_church_08_2,?!
d_ex_church_08_3,"When I come to my senses, I'm inside the church."
d_ex_church_08_4,"This place wasn't too far away, so I decided to bring you here."
d_ex_church_08_5,Everyone's here now.
d_ex_church_08_6,"Hello, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_church_08_7,What the... what's going on?
d_ex_church_08_8,Well...
d_ex_church_08_9,"It's about our library. The one at the Ark, not the Outpost."
d_ex_church_08_10,We've been having a small issue with our security.
d_ex_church_08_11,Really?
d_ex_church_08_12,Yeah. There have been several attempts at unlawful entry over the past few days.
d_ex_church_08_13,"Fortunately, no one's managed to get inside the Forbidden Library yet,"
d_ex_church_08_14,but we've been consulting with Perilous Siege just in case.
d_ex_church_08_15,"Arcana and her colleagues haven't been able to find a single lead on the intruder, so we were discussing whether we need to step in."
d_ex_church_08_16,Is it really necessary to call you guys in for something like this?
d_ex_church_08_17,Not necessarily.
d_ex_church_08_18,"However, if the Forbidden Library... I mean, the Top-secret Archive,"
d_ex_church_08_19,"was breached, we'd have a serious problem on our hands."
d_ex_church_08_20,Best to nip this problem in the bud.
d_ex_church_08_21,All right. Let me know how I can help.
d_ex_church_08_22,We'll keep you updated.
d_ex_church_08_23,...
d_ex_church_08_24,"As I look around, our voices echo through the otherwise solemnly quiet church."
d_ex_church_08_25,Why did you choose this of all places to meet up and discuss this?
d_ex_church_08_26,The Forbidden Library houses many records pertaining to those who've passed on.
d_ex_church_08_27,"If we're touching on the subject of ghosts or spirits,"
d_ex_church_08_28,"we ought to show them some respect in order to appease them, shouldn't we?"
d_ex_church_08_29,... Kinda spooky when you think about it.
d_ex_church_08_30,Don't lie.
d_ex_church_08_31,There's no fear in your eyes.
d_ex_church_08_32,Wha... you can tell that just by looking?
d_ex_church_08_33,We've seen what real fear looks like.
d_ex_church_08_34,Oh... hehe... I guess you're right...
d_ex_church_08_35,"Okay, I'll admit it. I don't find ghosts particularly scary."
d_ex_church_08_36,You don't?
d_ex_church_08_37,Isn't the harsh reality of the world way scarier than ghosts?
d_ex_church_08_38,I suppose.
d_ex_church_08_39,We're getting off track.
d_ex_church_08_40,This all probably boils down to a bumbling thief who's in over their head.
d_ex_church_08_41,The Forbidden Library has never been breached...
d_ex_church_08_42,Ugh. You're the reason that ridiculous name has gotten stuck in my head. I wish you'd stop calling it that.
d_ex_church_08_43,That's because it's so much easier to remember.
d_ex_church_08_44,It's certainly way better than Top-secret Archive. That's so clunky.
d_ex_church_08_45,You three seem to be getting along better.
d_ex_church_08_46,"Yeah, we've gotten more comfortable with each other. We even shoot the breeze from time to time."
d_ex_church_08_47,There were a lot of things that needed adjusting because of you being granted additional clearance.
d_ex_church_08_48,There was? I didn't notice.
d_ex_church_08_49,"Wow, you're all practically buddies at this point."
d_ex_church_08_50,*Rustle*
d_ex_church_08_51,?
d_ex_church_08_52,We turn our heads at the sound coming from the corner.
d_ex_church_08_53,*Squeak*
d_ex_church_08_54,A small mouse appears from who-knows-where.
d_ex_church_08_55,Gyaaaaaaaaaaah!
d_ex_church_08_56,Arcana screams and clings to me.
d_ex_church_08_57,Is that a mouse?!
d_ex_church_08_58,D-do something!
d_ex_church_08_59,What do you want me to do?
d_ex_church_08_60,I'm sure D and K can handle it.
d_ex_church_08_61,...
d_ex_church_08_62,...
d_ex_church_08_63,... Or not.
d_ex_church_08_64,"Hey, give us a break!"
d_ex_church_08_65,"We're girls too, you know."
d_ex_church_08_66,There's something about mice that disgusts females on a genetic level.
d_ex_church_08_67,Are you being serious?
d_ex_church_08_68,"I'm not scared, mind you,"
d_ex_church_08_69,but I'm not trying to go anywhere near that thing either.
d_ex_church_08_70,Agreed.
d_ex_church_08_71,*Squeak*
d_ex_church_08_72,Gah! It's coming this way!
d_ex_church_08_73,Hurry and do something!
d_ex_church_08_74,Arcana is still clinging tightly to me.
d_ex_church_08_75,...
d_ex_church_08_76,...
d_ex_church_08_77,"Meanwhile, D and K slowly back away."
d_ex_church_08_78,What do you expect me to do?
d_ex_church_08_79,I'm scared too!
d_ex_church_08_80,Why don't you two lend {AccountData.NickName} your weapons?
d_ex_church_08_81,*Schnick*
d_ex_church_08_82,...
d_ex_church_08_83,What did you just say?!
d_ex_church_08_84,Arcana's suggestion causes D and K's tempers to flare.
d_ex_church_08_85,*Squeak squeak squeak*
d_ex_church_08_86,*Step step*
d_ex_church_08_87,"As the mouse approaches, they calmly take two steps back."
d_ex_church_08_88,Gyah!
d_ex_church_08_89,Retreat!
d_ex_church_08_90,"In the end, we carried out a ""tactical retreat"""
d_ex_church_08_91,and decided to call for backup in the form of Happy Zoo.
d_ex_court_08_title,Cutthroat Businesswoman
d_ex_court_08_1,Huh?
d_ex_court_08_2,"While passing by the Courthouse, I spot an unlikely pair standing together."
d_ex_court_08_3,*Sigh*...
d_ex_court_08_4,Can I ask you one more thing?
d_ex_court_08_5,"When you're working, what kind of mindset do you have?"
d_ex_court_08_6,Do you do it because you have to?
d_ex_court_08_7,"Or is it more like, ""This is my duty, and I'm the only one who can do it!"""
d_ex_court_08_8,What are you two up to?
d_ex_court_08_9,"Oh, hey, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_court_08_10,"I wanted to learn a few things from a cutthroat businesswoman,"
d_ex_court_08_11,so I was chatting Yulha up.
d_ex_court_08_12,I see.
d_ex_court_08_13,Newbie. She's your responsibility.
d_ex_court_08_14,Take her with you.
d_ex_court_08_15,Understood.
d_ex_court_08_16,"What are you doing in front of the Courthouse anyway, Yulha?"
d_ex_court_08_17,I was waiting for Privaty. It's work-related.
d_ex_court_08_18,... Tch. Late again.
d_ex_court_08_19,Yulha!
d_ex_court_08_20,"Sorry that I'm late! I was cleaning up at the cafe, and..."
d_ex_court_08_21,"Mast... I mean, Commander?"
d_ex_court_08_22,Hello.
d_ex_court_08_23,"Oh, um, hello."
d_ex_court_08_24,"Sorry, but I can't talk. There's something urgent I have to discuss with Yulha."
d_ex_court_08_25,No problem. Take your time.
d_ex_court_08_26,Be sure to save some of those magic spells for later!
d_ex_court_08_27,Thanks for understanding!
d_ex_court_08_28,Huh?
d_ex_court_08_29,Yulha and Privaty step aside and start having what seems to be a serious conversation.
d_ex_court_08_30,"Hey, hey."
d_ex_court_08_31,Who's that lady who just arrived?
d_ex_court_08_32,"I heard Yulha's someone super duper important, but..."
d_ex_court_08_33,Yulha said it was about work... I wonder what it's about specifically?
d_ex_court_08_34,They were talking like equals. Does that mean...?
d_ex_court_08_35,Well...
d_ex_court_08_36,"She's a judge, like Yulha."
d_ex_court_08_37,She's a maid who helps out in the courthouse.
d_ex_court_08_38,?
d_ex_court_08_39,"Arcana blinks slowly, attempting to process what she's just been told."
d_ex_court_08_40,Uh...
d_ex_court_08_41,Then how come she's wearing a maid outfit?
d_ex_court_08_42,She's a maid-judge.
d_ex_court_08_43,... A maid-judge?
d_ex_court_08_44,Yeah. She does both jobs.
d_ex_court_08_45,"To use your parlance, she's a professional in multiple fields."
d_ex_court_08_46,!!!
d_ex_court_08_47,"Wow! I guess it makes sense,"
d_ex_court_08_48,what with the strongest commander in the Ark being stationed here.
d_ex_court_08_49,"Wait, hang on...!"
d_ex_court_08_50,"Before I can stop her, Arcana has run up to Yulha and Privaty."
d_ex_court_08_51,"Excuse me, sorry to interrupt..."
d_ex_court_08_52,"Oh, it's fine."
d_ex_court_08_53,We just finished.
d_ex_court_08_54,Then... would it be okay if I asked you a few questions? Think of it as a mini career interview!
d_ex_court_08_55,"Sure, I don't mind."
d_ex_court_08_56,Ask me anything.
d_ex_court_08_57,...
d_ex_court_08_58,...
d_ex_court_08_59,"Yulha and I lock eyes, both of us feeling an impending storm approaching."
d_ex_court_08_60,Being a professional maid is a rather unique occupation—what made you interested in that kind of work?
d_ex_court_08_61,Excuse me?
d_ex_court_08_62,You're not embarrassed by any of that cutesy stuff you have to do?
d_ex_court_08_63,...!
d_ex_court_08_64,I don't think I could even do that for someone I like. I admire your professionalism!
d_ex_court_08_65,?!
d_ex_court_08_66,*Sigh*...
d_ex_court_08_67,"Arcana's words, although innocent in intent, nonetheless strike a crippling emotional blow to Privaty."
d_ex_court_08_68,"Newbie, do you think you can fix this?"
d_ex_court_08_69,I think this is above my skill level.
d_ex_court_08_70,Me too.
d_ex_court_08_71,...
d_ex_court_08_72,"All right, fine. I'll see what I can do."
d_ex_court_08_73,"A long while later,"
d_ex_court_08_74,"I finally am able to calm down the enraged Privaty,"
d_ex_court_08_75,"and explain to Arcana that even though she is wearing a maid outfit, Privaty is not a full-time maid."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_title,Energy Drain
d_ex_flowerpark_04_1,"While giving Arcana a tour of the Outpost, we stop by Flower Park."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_2,"Wow, I had no idea this place existed."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_3,It's fairly new.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_4,It's so pretty!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_5,Can I come here on my own?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_6,As long as you follow the rules.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_7,Cool! I'd love to come here often.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_8,I wonder if it looks this pretty at night.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_9,I'm not sure if we're allowed to come here in the evening.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_10,"Even if we're not, couldn't you pull a few strings?"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_11,Aren't you the head honcho who calls the shots around here?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_12,"Uh, not exactly."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_13,Sweetie!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_14,"Hello, Subordinate."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_15,Hey. Are you guys just hanging out?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_16,"Yeah, we were chatting and thought we'd take in the flowers while we were at it."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_17,It's hard imagining you two chewing the fat.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_18,"We're not simply ""chewing the fat"", Subordinate."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_19,Who's this lovely lady you have with you?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_20,I haven't had the pleasure. Introduce me!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_21,"Oh, this is..."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_22,I introduce Arcana to Helm and Rupee.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_23,"Wow, so you're a librarian?"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_24,Lending out books at the library and everything... just hearing it makes you sound so intelligent!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_25,Haha.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_26,"I'm not as impressive as you think, Miss Rupee."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_27,Is that what I should call you? Miss Rupee?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_28,"Oh, certainly not! It's so formal."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_29,Just call me Rupee. We're all friends here.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_30,"Thank you for saying that, but I may still speak in a way that seems excessively formal to you from time to time."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_31,It's more natural for me to speak that way.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_32,"Okay, no problem!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_33,"Wow, is that finger armor on your hand? It's gorgeous."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_34,"Your shawl is so lovely as well, and your accessories are super stylish."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_35,Are you into fashion?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_36,"I do enjoy this sort of thing, but..."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_37,May I ask... are you the same Rupee from Rushae?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_38,Hehe.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_39,"Indeed it is I, the one and only Rupee from Rushae, in the flesh!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_40,Wow! It's almost like meeting a celebrity.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_41,"There's no ""almost"" about it. I am a celebrity!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_42,"However, if you're into fashion, how come you don't own anything from Rushae?"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_43,Do you feel it's not your style?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_44,"Oh, well..."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_45,"To be honest, it's a little outside my price range."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_46,!!!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_47,Then allow me to use my privileges as a brand ambassador to give it to you.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_48,Someone like you simply must wear Rushae for everything to be right with the world.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_49,"Wow, really?"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_50,Of course!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_51,But in return...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_52,"I know. I should wear it all the time, and when people ask me about it, I must be sure to tell them it's from Rushae."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_53,"Hehe, thank you!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_54,Is there anything you had your eye on in particular?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_55,"Oh, well... th-that new dress from the latest collection is quite nice!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_56,"You mean Floral Reverie, right?"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_57,"This is perfect, actually. I wasn't entirely happy with how it looked on me, and was thinking about finding someone else to model it for me."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_58,I'll customize one just for you. We can go get your measurements in a bit.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_59,...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_60,"Before I know it, Rupee and Arcana are off in their own world."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_61,*Sigh*...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_62,The simple act of watching them seems to have drained Helm's energy.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_63,You okay?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_64,Yeah. Things are going okay with Rupee.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_65,"We've gotten pretty close by now, and she's proven to be a surprisingly good listener."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_66,"However, even so..."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_67,Helm glances over at Rupee and Arcana.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_68,The pair are giggling and playfully nudging each other like lifelong best friends.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_69,"The way these two are going, I can already see myself getting roped into joining them for some crazy adventure."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_70,You're probably right.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_71,Can't you sit back and be a fly on the wall?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_72,Do you really think they'll let me get away with that?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_73,... Nope.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_74,Sweetie!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_75,I turn around to see Rupee and Arcana crouched down by the flowers.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_76,Guess where I am!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_77,Me too! Guess where I am!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_78,Uh... I wonder?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_79,"Oh my gosh, the flowers are talking!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_80,Haha!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_81,"Pfft! I certainly didn't expect you to say something like that, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_82,As I turn back to Helm...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_83,No. I'm not doing it.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_84,Huh? I didn't say anything.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_85,...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_86,Helm!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_87,"We were gonna go take photos, remember? Let's go!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_88,Arcana said she knows a super good studio!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_89,... Fine.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_90,"You too, Sweetie."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_91,...!
d_ex_flowerpark_04_92,Just as I'm summoning my courage to face what's coming...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_93,"Come to think of it, Subordinate."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_94,Don't you have a meeting soon?
d_ex_flowerpark_04_95,Hmm...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_96,"Oh my, that does seem to be the case."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_97,"Aw, what a shame!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_98,You'll just have to take a rain check.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_99,"Yeah, you've gotta be sure to come next time!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_100,Yeah... sure thing.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_101,...
d_ex_flowerpark_04_102,"See you next time, Subordinate!"
d_ex_flowerpark_04_103,... One victim is enough. I'll take the brunt of this blow.
d_ex_flowerpark_04_104,"Thanks, Helm."
d_ex_flowerpark_04_105,"Turning away from the tragic sight of Helm being dragged off by the girls, I quietly exit Flower Park."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_title,Musical Interlude
d_ex_flowerpark_05_1,"One day, as I'm passing by the Flower Park, I hear a violin."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_2,"Drawn in by the familiar sound, I make my way towards the heart of the garden."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_3,Sun! Fancy seeing you here.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_4,"My feelings for you, Conductor, must have been carried by the wind and led you here!"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_5,What are you guys up to?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_6,"We're just here relaxing, but with a twist!"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_7,Oh? Go on.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_8,Well.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_9,Julia is playing music for the little ones
d_ex_flowerpark_05_10,and me to enjoy.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_11,What kind of music have you been playing?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_12,"Now that Sun's here, would you mind playing a little more, Julia?"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_13,Certainly.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_14,"I'm so glad that you came, Conductor. I'll be sure to transfer that joy into my next performance."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_15,Julia starts playing the violin.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_16,"A peaceful and beautiful melody flows, seemingly putting my entire body at ease."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_17,That was so lovely.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_18,I can feel that the little ones appreciate it as well.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_19,If only Flora and Leaf could have joined us.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_20,It really was magnificent.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_21,Thank you all for being such a captive audience. I'm truly grateful that...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_22,*Rustle*
d_ex_flowerpark_05_23,"What the...?
How come there are so many people here?"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_24,K?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_25,Oh? Looks like another guest has arrived.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_26,I thought this place wasn't being used anymore.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_27,"Bah, fine. I'll have to go somewhere else."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_28,K turns to walk away.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_29,Huh? Why would you leave?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_30,Didn't you come here to take a break?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_31,Yes...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_32,Then why don't you stay and rest?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_33,"Even if it's only for a moment,"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_34,surrender your body to the gentle breeze and fragrance of nature before moving on.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_35,What are you blathering about?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_36,Trina grabs K by the arm and leads her to the grass.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_37,"Come on, stop putting up a fight and get over here."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_38,Hey! Let go of me!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_39,"Just give in, and sit here."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_40,*Thud*
d_ex_flowerpark_05_41,Trina seats K on the grass.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_42,How is it?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_43,Don't you feel this place has a calming presence?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_44,Not at all!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_45,How am I supposed to relax with this many people around?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_46,Ah! I see!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_47,So it's the number of people that's the problem for you.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_48,"In that case, think of me as one with nature."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_49,What a bunch of—
d_ex_flowerpark_05_50,"If that doesn't work, then think of me and my music as a mellifluous breeze amongst these bucolic surroundings."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_51,That's just as ridiculous!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_52,Ugh...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_53,You weirdoes are giving me a headache.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_54,Your head is troubling you?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_55,"In times like this, why not cast aside your heavy thoughts and enjoy some nice, tranquil music?"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_56,"Yeah!
Nothing relieves fatigue like listening to music while out in nature."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_57,Again with the hippy-dippy nonsense...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_58,"Now then, allow me to begin."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_59,I don't nee...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_60,Julia starts playing the violin again.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_61,"This time, a calm and peaceful melody fills the air, one slightly different from the one before."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_62,...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_63,That's... not bad.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_64,*Plop*
d_ex_flowerpark_05_65,K relaxes her body and lies down on the grass.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_66,I appreciate you saying that.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_67,Julia continues to play with a happy smile.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_68,*Clap clap*
d_ex_flowerpark_05_69,Bravo! Another masterful performance.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_70,...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_71,Do you take requests?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_72,Of course. Responding to the audience's call is the privilege of a performer.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_73,What song would you like?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_74,A dirge.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_75,!!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_76,!!
d_ex_flowerpark_05_77,...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_78,Is that okay?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_79,"Of course.
Meeting and parting are inevitable parts of life."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_80,"I cannot say for certain whether my interpretation will resonate with you,"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_81,but I will play my idea of what a dirge should make one feel.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_82,Whatever. Just play.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_83,"Julia lifts her violin again,"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_84,and a quiet and sad melody fills the air.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_85,A forlorn tune which induces despair.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_86,Intense intonations which evoke surging anger.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_87,Desperation and sorrow.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_88,Beautiful and tender notes that feel like a comforting caress.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_89,The piece that Julia plays is enough to make the heart burst with emotion.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_90,...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_91,As soon as the performance comes to an end...
d_ex_flowerpark_05_92,... Well done.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_93,Huh?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_94,K stands up.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_95,I'm leaving.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_96,K quietly walks away.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_97,"My goodness, she certainly left quickly."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_98,It would have been nice if she'd stayed and rested a bit more.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_99,Do you think she didn't like the performance?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_100,That's not it.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_101,Her leaving so abruptly could be her way of showing she enjoyed it.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_102,"Hehe, well, that's a relief."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_103,Do you want to keep playing for the little ones?
d_ex_flowerpark_05_104,Of course.
d_ex_flowerpark_05_105,"I will continue to play for them, and wish for peace for them and everyone else as I do."
d_ex_flowerpark_05_106,"Julia resumes playing the violin,"
d_ex_flowerpark_05_107,"and we spend some more time enjoying a pleasant, restful musical interlude."

d_ex_mysteryclub_08_2,I look around.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_3,There is no one.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_4,"I heard someone's been coming and going here often, so I came to check it out."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_5,"Yeah, as expected, there's no way anyone would be here,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_6,especially when this place has been abandoned for a while now...
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_7,*Poke*
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_8,Gaaah!
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_9,*Crashhh*
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_10,Whoops! Are you okay?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_11,"Here, let me help you up."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_12,I lift my head and see...
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_13,What are you doing here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_14,"Forget about that, Captain. ♥"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_15,*Poke*
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_16,Hey! What the...?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_17,"Hehe, looks like this is your weak spot."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_18,"All I did was give a little poke,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_19,and you came tumbling down like a house of cards. ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_20,"Anyway, I'm sorry if I surprised you!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_21,"Here, take my hand and let me help you up. ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_22,"I grab Sora's hand, and she helps me up."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_23,"Well, what a surprise."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_24,"Running into you here, Captain! ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_25,What are you doing over here?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_26,"This is supposed to be an abandoned building,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_27,but people have reported seeing someone coming and going.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_28,...☆
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_29,What a pain... I better move the stuff quickly.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_30,Huh? What did you say?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_31,"Hmm? Oh, nothing. ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_32,"Anyway, what are you doing here, Sora?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_33,"Oh, I was just passing by."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_34,"I got curious and came inside,"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_35,and ended up running into you. ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_36,"But I never imagined this place was abandoned, teehee."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_37,Hey!
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_38,Where are you going?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_39,"Since I'm here, I might as well take a quick look inside."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_40,Sora firmly links her arm with mine.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_41,Uh... is that really necessary?♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_42,"You said yourself that this place is abandoned, right?★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_43,There's probably nothing here.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_44,"Oooh, I've got an idea! ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_45,"How about we go on a little date, just the two of us?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_46,"Captain, you're so popular that"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_47,"it's not often I get to have you all to myself, hehe. ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_48,"... Okay, but let me have a quick look around first."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_49,Hyah! ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_50,*Poke poke*
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_51,Gaaah!
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_52,*Crashhh*
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_53,Sora climbs on top of me as I collapse to the ground once more.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_54,"With a devilish smile, she twirls her index finger in the air as if to show off."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_55,Ready to surrender? Or are you going to keep resisting?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_56,... Okay. I surrender.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_57,"Hehe, all right. Shall we go then?♥"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_58,"You didn't think I'd give up that easy, did you?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_59,...?!
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_60,"The moment Sora lets her guard down, I dash behind her and head into the building."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_61,So this is what you were trying to keep from me.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_62,"... Hehe. ★ Looks like you outsmarted me this time, Captain."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_63,"In the corner of the club, I spot a pile of things awkwardly sticking out from behind a curtain."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_64,Just my luck.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_65,"I came here today to tidy this place up and ended up running into you, Captain. ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_66,Is that the truth?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_67,Of course. ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_68,Have I ever lied to you?
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_69,You did that a few moments ago.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_70,"Oh, come now!"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_71,That was just a little white lie. ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_72,I just don't want you getting dragged into this mess for no good reason. ♥
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_73,"Hehe, you know what I mean, right?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_74,...
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_75,...☆
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_76,"Okay, fine. I'll pretend I didn't see anything."
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_77,Just make sure it's gone by the end of the day and don't use this place again for whatever it is you're doing.
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_78,"Oh my gosh, really?"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_79,"You're the best, Captain! ♥"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_80,"I'll clean everything up and never touch this place again, pinky promise! ★"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_81,"Thank you so, so much! ♥"
d_ex_mysteryclub_08_82,"Just like she promised, Sora clears the place out in a single day."
d_ex_observationpost_10_title,A Secret Between the Two of Us
d_ex_observationpost_10_1,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_10_2,A-about time you showed up!
d_ex_observationpost_10_3,Do you know how long I've been wait...!
d_ex_observationpost_10_4,Hmm?
d_ex_observationpost_10_5,Gah!
d_ex_observationpost_10_6,C-Commander?
d_ex_observationpost_10_7,Signal's head droops down with a look of disappointment.
d_ex_observationpost_10_8,... Am I not welcome here?
d_ex_observationpost_10_9,"It's just that we were waiting for someone else,"
d_ex_observationpost_10_10,that's all.
d_ex_observationpost_10_11,D-Delta!
d_ex_observationpost_10_12,You can't tell him that!
d_ex_observationpost_10_13,*Zing*
d_ex_observationpost_10_14,Hello! ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_15,Oh my! Captain!
d_ex_observationpost_10_16,"I'm sorry for being late, Signal. ★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_17,I got held up at work.
d_ex_observationpost_10_18,C-come on in...!
d_ex_observationpost_10_19,"We've been waiting for you, Sora..."
d_ex_observationpost_10_20,That's who we were waiting for.
d_ex_observationpost_10_21,Sora?
d_ex_observationpost_10_22,"Yes, you can tell just by her expression."
d_ex_observationpost_10_23,Hehe.
d_ex_observationpost_10_24,... She does look awfully excited.
d_ex_observationpost_10_25,"I didn't keep you waiting too long, did I?★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_26,I brought a bunch of stuff that you're gonna love!
d_ex_observationpost_10_27,R-really?!
d_ex_observationpost_10_28,You betcha! Feast your eyes on this! ♥
d_ex_observationpost_10_29,*Clatter*
d_ex_observationpost_10_30,Sora flips the bag she is holding upside down and pours out its contents.
d_ex_observationpost_10_31,Whoaaaaaa!
d_ex_observationpost_10_32,A variety of USB sticks and DVDs spill out.
d_ex_observationpost_10_33,Oh my gosh! Heart Pounding Memories! This show's a classic!
d_ex_observationpost_10_34,It must have been incredibly difficult to get your hands on this.
d_ex_observationpost_10_35,"And then this... Only You, My Love! Another masterpiece!"
d_ex_observationpost_10_36,And this one...! And then this...!
d_ex_observationpost_10_37,"Haha, easy there, tiger. ★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_38,They're not gonna grow legs and run off. Take your time browsing.
d_ex_observationpost_10_39,"Oh, and I've got a present for you as well, Delta."
d_ex_observationpost_10_40,For me?
d_ex_observationpost_10_41,That's right. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_42,Here it is!
d_ex_observationpost_10_43,*Slide*
d_ex_observationpost_10_44,"Oh, these are..."
d_ex_observationpost_10_45,Multipurpose military goggles and the latest model at that. ♥
d_ex_observationpost_10_46,"The moment I saw them, I thought of you."
d_ex_observationpost_10_47,I went through a lot of trouble to get these for you. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_48,I didn't expect to receive a gift as well.
d_ex_observationpost_10_49,I will make good use of these.
d_ex_observationpost_10_50,Delta begins inspecting the goggles with keen interest.
d_ex_observationpost_10_51,"Unfortunately, I didn't know you'd be here, Captain,"
d_ex_observationpost_10_52,so I didn't prepare anything for you. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_53,That's all right.
d_ex_observationpost_10_54,...☆
d_ex_observationpost_10_55,Tell you what. Here's what I'll do.
d_ex_observationpost_10_56,?
d_ex_observationpost_10_57,Signal. I lost something on the surface not too long ago. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_58,I was wondering if I could use your observation device for a bit?
d_ex_observationpost_10_59,"O-oh, sure! Go right ahead."
d_ex_observationpost_10_60,"Signal answers absent-mindedly, her gaze fixed on the TV screen."
d_ex_observationpost_10_61,"Delta, too, seems busy examining the goggles."
d_ex_observationpost_10_62,"Meanwhile, Sora starts using the observation device as if it's second nature."
d_ex_observationpost_10_63,"... You know you can't find lost things with that device, right?"
d_ex_observationpost_10_64,"Oh, but of course I do. ★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_65,Then what are you looking for?
d_ex_observationpost_10_66,"A way into your heart, hehe. ♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_67,...
d_ex_observationpost_10_68,...☆
d_ex_observationpost_10_69,"Geez, you really never let anything slide, do you?★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_70,"Fiiine, fine!"
d_ex_observationpost_10_71,"Heehee, this is just between us, okay, Captain?♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_72,I'm just observing the surface.
d_ex_observationpost_10_73,Checking how things are looking up there—
d_ex_observationpost_10_74,"how many Raptures are in the area,"
d_ex_observationpost_10_75,"which areas are dangerous,"
d_ex_observationpost_10_76,"which ones are safe, that kind of thing. ♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_77,"I really do love the surface, you know?★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_78,"And while I'm at it, I've picked up a little hobby too."
d_ex_observationpost_10_79,And what would that be?
d_ex_observationpost_10_80,Ta-da! ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_81,Sora holds up a tablet and shows me what she has written down.
d_ex_observationpost_10_82,The weather today is clear?
d_ex_observationpost_10_83,"Hehe, yep! ♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_84,I check the weather very carefully. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_85,It's actually pretty fun comparing the weather on the surface with that of the Ark every day.
d_ex_observationpost_10_86,"So, no matter how busy I get,"
d_ex_observationpost_10_87,I always try to stop by
d_ex_observationpost_10_88,at least once every two weeks. ★
d_ex_observationpost_10_89,"And while I'm at it, I bring back gifts that I know Signal and Delta will love. ♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_90,I see.
d_ex_observationpost_10_91,"Next time, I'll be sure to bring something for you too, Captain, just in case. ★"
d_ex_observationpost_10_92,"Oh, wait, scratch that."
d_ex_observationpost_10_93,"I've already shared my secret with you, so it's all good. ♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_94,"But promise me you'll keep it just between us, okay?♥"
d_ex_observationpost_10_95,"For quite a while after, I watch Sora check the weather."

d_ex_toyshop_11_3,Hello. You're by yourself today?
d_ex_toyshop_11_4,"Yeah, Belorta is out running an errand."
d_ex_toyshop_11_5,"Are you here to get a toy, Old-Timer?"
d_ex_toyshop_11_6,"No, I came to see you and Belorta."
d_ex_toyshop_11_7,"Oh, wow! I'm glad I stayed in the shop then."
d_ex_toyshop_11_8,"I'm gonna brag about this to Belorta when she gets back, hehe."
d_ex_toyshop_11_9,*Ring*
d_ex_toyshop_11_10,"Oh, is she back alread..."
d_ex_toyshop_11_11,Captain?
d_ex_toyshop_11_12,Fancy seeing you at the Toy Store! ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_13,"Hey, Sora! Welcome!"
d_ex_toyshop_11_14,"Hello, Mica."
d_ex_toyshop_11_15,You're here again today.
d_ex_toyshop_11_16,Sora bends down to meet Mica at eye level.
d_ex_toyshop_11_17,"Hehe, I couldn't resist, so here I am again. ♥"
d_ex_toyshop_11_18,Oh? Do you come to the Toy Store often?
d_ex_toyshop_11_19,"Yep, that's right! ★"
d_ex_toyshop_11_20,"I'm not sure if you remember,"
d_ex_toyshop_11_21,but I've got a few little friends. ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_22,"Whenever I visit them, I always bring them some toys. ♥"
d_ex_toyshop_11_23,There's no toy store quite like this one. ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_24,"They've got all kinds of cool toys you've never seen or heard of before,"
d_ex_toyshop_11_25,"and the selection changes every season, too. ♥"
d_ex_toyshop_11_26,So I end up stopping by often without even realizing it
d_ex_toyshop_11_27,"and wondering what new toys they have today, hehe."
d_ex_toyshop_11_28,"Hehe. Actually,"
d_ex_toyshop_11_29,Belorta went out today to get a new toy again.
d_ex_toyshop_11_30,She said she found something really fun and was totally excited about it!
d_ex_toyshop_11_31,You can definitely look forward to it!
d_ex_toyshop_11_32,That's great news! ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_33,"Finding new toys is definitely Belorta's favorite thing, isn't it?"
d_ex_toyshop_11_34,I'll be sure to drop by tomorrow too!
d_ex_toyshop_11_35,"I must say, you're doing a wonderful job managing the store on your own, Mica. ♥"
d_ex_toyshop_11_36,Sora pats Mica on the head.
d_ex_toyshop_11_37,Hehe!
d_ex_toyshop_11_38,It's no biggie. I'm used to it by now.
d_ex_toyshop_11_39,Mica gives a shy but bright smile.
d_ex_toyshop_11_40,"Oh, what's this now?"
d_ex_toyshop_11_41,Your helmet seems a little crooked.
d_ex_toyshop_11_42,Let's see... if we just do this...
d_ex_toyshop_11_43,There we go. All better!
d_ex_toyshop_11_44,"Hehe, thanks."
d_ex_toyshop_11_45,"Now then, since I've made a trip out here,"
d_ex_toyshop_11_46,I intend on leaving with my hands full! ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_47,Are there any toys you would suggest?
d_ex_toyshop_11_48,You always have the best recommendations.
d_ex_toyshop_11_49,And you do such a wonderful job of introducing them that I can't help but snatch them up. ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_50,"Oh, we've got plenty of things!"
d_ex_toyshop_11_51,"Come along, Old-Timer. I'll introduce them to you, too."
d_ex_toyshop_11_52,Sora and I spend a while listening to Mica's toy recommendations.
d_ex_toyshop_11_53,Only after Sora has purchased a veritable mountain of toys am I finally able to leave the store with her.
d_ex_toyshop_11_55,Will you both be coming tomorrow as well?
d_ex_toyshop_11_56,Huh? Me too?
d_ex_toyshop_11_57,"Of course! Captain's coming again tomorrow, right?"
d_ex_toyshop_11_58,I...
d_ex_toyshop_11_59,...
d_ex_toyshop_11_60,...☆
d_ex_toyshop_11_61,"Faced with the puppy dog eyes from both Mica and Sora,"
d_ex_toyshop_11_62,I can't bring myself to say that I'm busy.
d_ex_toyshop_11_63,I guess I'll have to make time somehow.
d_ex_toyshop_11_64,"Uh... yeah, okay."
d_ex_toyshop_11_65,Yayyy! Belorta's gonna be so happy about this!
d_ex_toyshop_11_66,"Hehe, glad to hear it."
d_ex_toyshop_11_67,"Well, see you tomorrow, Mica. ★"
d_ex_toyshop_11_68,See you guys tomorrow!
d_ex_toyshop_11_69,We leave the toy store as Mica sees us off.
d_ex_toyshop_11_70,That was unexpected.
d_ex_toyshop_11_71,What do you mean?
d_ex_toyshop_11_72,You seem like a different person when you're with kids.
d_ex_toyshop_11_73,"... Hehe, I hear that a lot. ★"
d_ex_toyshop_11_74,They're just so cute
d_ex_toyshop_11_75,"and pure, you know?♥"
d_ex_toyshop_11_76,"But sometimes, it makes me a little sad knowing that these kids will have to face this harsh world someday..."
d_ex_toyshop_11_77,...☆
d_ex_toyshop_11_78,Hehe. I'm not used to being so serious. ★
d_ex_toyshop_11_79,"Anyway, Captain, don't forget to come tomorrow."
d_ex_toyshop_11_80,No going back on your word! ♥
d_ex_toyshop_11_81,Sora leaves with a bright smile.

d_ex_maidcafe_11_18,You could say I'm the temporary manager for today.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_19,I'm going back.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_20,This isn't what I signed up for.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_21,"W-wait, Eunhwa!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_22,"Yo-you're not really gonna leave, are you?"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_23,I-I really wanted to eat some parfait with you...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_24,Yo-you said you would do anything...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_25,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_26,Bah. Fine. Hurry up and order then.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_27,"... Hehe, thanks."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_28,M-Master...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_29,Miss Eunhwa seems to have a soft spot for Miss Vesti!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_30,Sh-she does?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_31,What are you two whispering about?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_32,Hurry up and show us to our seats.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_33,"O-oh, of course! R-right this way!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_34,Vesti.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_35,Yeah? You called?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_36,May I ask what this is about?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_37,"Hehe, well, you see..."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_38,Wh-what? Are you serious?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_39,"Yo-you're not lying to me, are you?"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_40,"Yeah, I owe you that much."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_41,Are you really going to do whatever I want?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_42,Sure.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_43,Wherever?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_44,"Yeah, doesn't matter to me."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_45,Hehe... hehehe...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_46,"... That's a promise, right?"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_47,*Sigh*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_48,I shouldn't have said that.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_49,Sorry to keep you waiting.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_50,Here's the parfait you ordered!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_51,*Clink*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_52,"Hehe, i-it looks yummy… Right, Eunhwa?"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_53,Not bad at all.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_54,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_55,"We've got our food, so you can leave now."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_56,Huh? But...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_57,we haven't done the most important part?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_58,Exactly.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_59,And what's that?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_60,"O-ooey gooey goodness, make this delicious!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_61,"Coochie woochie, boing! ♡"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_62,"Wow, Miss Vesti! That was just amazing!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_63,You're so much more confident than usual!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_64,"Heh, hehe."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_65,I've been practicing a lot because I wanted to show Eunhwa how well I can do.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_66,"Now then, Eunhwa."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_67,It's your turn.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_68,"Y-yeah...! I wanna see Eunhwa do it too, hehe."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_69,Don't be ridiculous.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_70,... Huh?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_71,You're asking me to do something that foolish?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_72,"Even if I promised, this crosses the line."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_73,"W-wait, Eunhwa..."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_74,*Bang*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_75,I'm out. The rest is up to you.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_76,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_77,*Sniffle*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_78,I-I'm sorry... Eunhwa.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_79,I-I didn't know you'd hate it so much.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_80,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_81,Th-this is a spell that's supposed to make it taste even better...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_82,"I just wanted you to enjoy the parfait more, Eunhwa..."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_83,*Sigh*...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_84,Fine. Just this once.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_85,...!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_86,R-really? Y-you're actually gonna do it?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_87,"Yes, I'll do it, so be quiet."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_88,Whew...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_89,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_90,... cious.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_91,!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_92,... chie... chie.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_93,Boing.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_94,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_95,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_96,"M-Miss Eunhwa, your face is sooo red...!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_97,*Sigh* I'm already bending over backwards for you. Don't push your luck.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_98,Get lost. All of you.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_99,*Click*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_100,Did someone just take a photo?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_101,"... Hehe, that came out great!"
d_ex_maidcafe_11_102,"L-look at this, Eunhwa. Yo-you look really cute."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_103,"On Vesti's phone screen, there's a picture of Eunhwa sitting in front of a parfait, her face bright red."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_104,...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_105,... Delete it.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_106,H-huh? What do you mean?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_107,I said delete it!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_108,*Crash!*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_109,Eunhwa bolts up and lunges for the phone.
d_ex_maidcafe_11_110,Gaaah! Sh-shaking Eunhwa's on a rampage!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_111,"Vesti narrowly dodges Eunhwa, staying just out of reach."
d_ex_maidcafe_11_112,Gaaaaaah!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_113,*Ring*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_114,Stop right there!
d_ex_maidcafe_11_115,*Bang*
d_ex_maidcafe_11_116,Um...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_117,Wh-what in the world just happened?
d_ex_maidcafe_11_118,I-I'm not sure...
d_ex_maidcafe_11_119,Only after cleaning up the messy table are Soda and I able to move onto our next task.
d_ex_church_09_title,God in the Box
d_ex_church_09_1,Hah!
d_ex_church_09_2,*Hop*
d_ex_church_09_3,*Tap*
d_ex_church_09_4,"Hehe, this should be enough for now."
d_ex_church_09_5,There's no better place than a quiet church to loosen up a body stiffened from working at the library.
d_ex_church_09_6,...
d_ex_church_09_7,I suppose I should be heading back.
d_ex_church_09_8,"If anyone sees me like this, things could get rather troublesome."
d_ex_church_09_9,*Clatter clatter*
d_ex_church_09_10,Hm? Is someone here?
d_ex_church_09_11,*Clatter*
d_ex_church_09_12,!!
d_ex_church_09_13,I-I suppose I'll hide in this box for now...
d_ex_church_09_14,*Clunk*
d_ex_church_09_15,"Hehe, thanks for coming with me, Commander."
d_ex_church_09_16,"Sure, but what are you planning to do at church?"
d_ex_church_09_17,"Well, you see... I used to pray often"
d_ex_church_09_18,for more friends
d_ex_church_09_19,and for our squad to grow closer.
d_ex_church_09_20,That's kind of you.
d_ex_church_09_21,Did it come true?
d_ex_church_09_22,You bet!
d_ex_church_09_23,"In the end, our squad grew a lot closer,"
d_ex_church_09_24,"a-and I made lots of friends, like you, Commander..."
d_ex_church_09_25,So I just wanted to stop by and give my thanks.
d_ex_church_09_26,And to pray for everything to go well going forward.
d_ex_church_09_27,That's a good idea.
d_ex_church_09_28,*Rustle*
d_ex_church_09_29,*Cough cough*
d_ex_church_09_30,?
d_ex_church_09_31,...?
d_ex_church_09_32,"D-did you hear that, Commander?"
d_ex_church_09_33,"Yeah, is someone there?"
d_ex_church_09_34,It might be someone dangerous.
d_ex_church_09_35,"If there's anyone intending to harm you, Commander..."
d_ex_church_09_36,I'll kill them!
d_ex_church_09_37,!!!
d_ex_church_09_38,*Step step*
d_ex_church_09_39,The sound came from over there.
d_ex_church_09_40,*Flap*
d_ex_church_09_41,"Vesti flips her shawl aside,"
d_ex_church_09_42,and dozens of guiding lasers focus on a single spot.
d_ex_church_09_43,... Eeep!
d_ex_church_09_44,W-wait!
d_ex_church_09_45,Huh?
d_ex_church_09_46,"H-hey, you."
d_ex_church_09_47,Aren't you Vesti?
d_ex_church_09_48,!!
d_ex_church_09_49,H-how did you know my name?
d_ex_church_09_50,"Hold on, are you...?"
d_ex_church_09_51,"Y-yes, that's right."
d_ex_church_09_52,"I am the thie... no, the God"
d_ex_church_09_53,who answers your prayers.
d_ex_church_09_54,...!
d_ex_church_09_55,This voice...
d_ex_church_09_56,... It's Phantom.
d_ex_church_09_57,S-so you really do exist?
d_ex_church_09_58,Of course.
d_ex_church_09_59,"Vesti, I came down to this world"
d_ex_church_09_60,specially to see how you're doing.
d_ex_church_09_61,"From what I just heard, it seems you're holding up well."
d_ex_church_09_62,"Y-yeah, that's right!"
d_ex_church_09_63,"I came here today to thank you, so..."
d_ex_church_09_64,Th-thank you so much!
d_ex_church_09_65,"For protecting me, and Eunhwa... and Emma."
d_ex_church_09_66,And the Commander too...
d_ex_church_09_67,"Hehe, how interesting."
d_ex_church_09_68,"You, of all people, offering thanks? You're the one who's cared and tried the hardest."
d_ex_church_09_69,"O-oh no, I didn't really do anything."
d_ex_church_09_70,What God said is true. You really did your best.
d_ex_church_09_71,R-really?
d_ex_church_09_72,Wh-what do I do... I think I'm gonna cry.
d_ex_church_09_73,"Hehe, don't cry, my child. There will be many better days ahead."
d_ex_church_09_74,Th-then...
d_ex_church_09_75,Can I ask for one more thing?
d_ex_church_09_76,Hmm? What is it?
d_ex_church_09_77,"Um, well..."
d_ex_church_09_78,*Glance*
d_ex_church_09_79,"C-Commander,"
d_ex_church_09_80,can you cover your ears for a bit...?
d_ex_church_09_81,Sure.
d_ex_church_09_82,I cover my ears with my palms.
d_ex_church_09_83,... Like... Person...
d_ex_church_09_84,Vesti's hushed whisper seeps through and reaches my ears in fits and starts.
d_ex_church_09_85,"O-okay, you can take your hands off now..."
d_ex_church_09_86,"Hmm, I see... If that's the case..."
d_ex_church_09_87,Yes?
d_ex_church_09_88,Hmm...
d_ex_church_09_89,Hmmmmm...
d_ex_church_09_90,"Ah, yes! That Goddess of Victory out there..."
d_ex_church_09_91,I believe I saw her feeling a bit neglected.
d_ex_church_09_92,Why don't you offer a prayer to her every now and then?
d_ex_church_09_93,Th-the Goddess of Victory? I didn't know she also listened to prayers.
d_ex_church_09_94,"Oh! Now that I think about it, she said she's going to descend to this world today as well."
d_ex_church_09_95,R-really?
d_ex_church_09_96,Exactly so! It would be best to go swiftly before it's too late. We won't know when she shall return again.
d_ex_church_09_97,"Oh... C-Commander, what should I do?"
d_ex_church_09_98,It seems I suddenly have somewhere urgent to go.
d_ex_church_09_99,I was the one who asked you to come here... I'm sorry.
d_ex_church_09_100,It's okay. I'll be here saying a few prayers of my own.
d_ex_church_09_101,Yo-you will?
d_ex_church_09_102,O-okay then. I-I'll be back real soon!
d_ex_church_09_103,J-just wait here!
d_ex_church_09_104,...
d_ex_church_09_105,You can come out now.
d_ex_church_09_106,*Clunk*
d_ex_church_09_107,*Cough cough!* *Cough!*
d_ex_church_09_108,"Man, I thought I was toast back there..."
d_ex_church_09_109,You did well.
d_ex_church_09_110,Hehehe.
d_ex_church_09_111,This is nothing.
d_ex_church_09_112,Any thief worth their salt must be a master of disguise and deception.
d_ex_church_09_113,But you're breaking out in cold sweat...
d_ex_church_09_114,A-ahem!
d_ex_church_09_115,Anyway!
d_ex_church_09_116,*Flap*
d_ex_church_09_117,"If Vesti returns, it could spell trouble for me."
d_ex_church_09_118,I shall take my leave now.
d_ex_church_09_119,Well then... farewell.
d_ex_church_09_120,*Clunk*
d_ex_church_09_121,... Huh?
d_ex_church_09_122,*Clunk clunk*
d_ex_church_09_123,Is this door... broken?
d_ex_church_09_124,Guess it broke when Vesti opened it earlier.
d_ex_church_09_125,Yo-you've got to be kidding me...
d_ex_church_09_126,"In the end, all we can do is wait for Vesti's return, and Phantom is forced to hide away inside the box once more."
d_ex_hotel_12_title,A Perfect Vacation
d_ex_hotel_12_1,I receive a message from an unknown sender.
d_ex_hotel_12_2,Meet me at the hotel by 1 PM today. ^.^♥
d_ex_hotel_12_3,"It's been on my mind, so I decide to stop by for a moment."
d_ex_hotel_12_4,*Whirr*
d_ex_hotel_12_5,What the... Weakling?
d_ex_hotel_12_6,"C-Commander, you're here too?"
d_ex_hotel_12_7,Did you guys get the message too?
d_ex_hotel_12_8,"Yeah, and from an unknown sender."
d_ex_hotel_12_9,I-I got the same one too.
d_ex_hotel_12_10,... I wonder who sent it?
d_ex_hotel_12_11,"With the three of us here,"
d_ex_hotel_12_12,I can more or less figure out what's going on.
d_ex_hotel_12_13,*Click clack*
d_ex_hotel_12_14,"Amid our confusion, we hear footsteps approaching the door."
d_ex_hotel_12_15,"Hehe, judging by how lively it sounds in there, looks like everyone's here!"
d_ex_hotel_12_16,Looks like we've walked right into a trap.
d_ex_hotel_12_17,This is bad...
d_ex_hotel_12_18,?
d_ex_hotel_12_19,*Whirr*
d_ex_hotel_12_20,"Hehe, everyone's here."
d_ex_hotel_12_21,"So, are you all ready to enjoy the staycation?"
d_ex_hotel_12_22,"Emma steps into the room, her arms loaded with luggage."
d_ex_hotel_12_23,"Wh-why did you send us those texts anonymously, Emma?"
d_ex_hotel_12_24,You could've just asked us to meet up anytime...
d_ex_hotel_12_25,"Hehe, I just wanted to surprise all of you today!"
d_ex_hotel_12_26,Oh... so wh-what are we doing today?
d_ex_hotel_12_27,"Heehee, think of this as a little morale boost for the team."
d_ex_hotel_12_28,I've brought some delicious food for us to enjoy!
d_ex_hotel_12_29,"While you relax comfortably on the bed, you can get the massage I've been wanting to give you."
d_ex_hotel_12_30,"I've been wanting to do this for a while, but somehow our schedules never matched up."
d_ex_hotel_12_31,...
d_ex_hotel_12_32,Why am I...?
d_ex_hotel_12_33,"That's because you're part of the team too, Commander."
d_ex_hotel_12_34,Now then...
d_ex_hotel_12_35,*Click*
d_ex_hotel_12_36,Emma pulls out a bento box.
d_ex_hotel_12_37,"Even from a distance, I can sense something sinister coming off it."
d_ex_hotel_12_38,"All righty, who wants the first bite?"
d_ex_hotel_12_39,!!!
d_ex_hotel_12_40,I've gotta get out of here.
d_ex_hotel_12_41,"... Give it up, Weakling."
d_ex_hotel_12_42,You're already here. It's impossible to escape from Emma's clutches.
d_ex_hotel_12_43,"Would you like to start, Eunhwa? Or maybe you, Vesti?"
d_ex_hotel_12_44,"Oh, I ate a lot just before coming."
d_ex_hotel_12_45,Too bad.
d_ex_hotel_12_46,M-me too! I went with Eunhwa!
d_ex_hotel_12_47,Didn't someone just say it was impossible to get out of it...?
d_ex_hotel_12_48,"Oh my, really? You two are even going out to eat together now?"
d_ex_hotel_12_49,"Hehe, I'm really glad you've become so close!"
d_ex_hotel_12_50,"Before I even notice, Emma is right in front of me, holding out a spoon."
d_ex_hotel_12_51,"Now then, Commander. Be a good boy..."
d_ex_hotel_12_52,Open up for me.
d_ex_hotel_12_53,Eat.
d_ex_hotel_12_54,Eat.

d_ex_hotel_12_61,Ughhh...
d_ex_hotel_12_62,U-ughh.
d_ex_hotel_12_63,Everyone around me is writhing in discomfort.
d_ex_hotel_12_64,"Hehe, Emma, that tickles."
d_ex_hotel_12_65,?
d_ex_hotel_12_66,Hehehehe.
d_ex_hotel_12_67,"When I open my eyes, I see myself lying on the bed,"
d_ex_hotel_12_68,"and next to me, Vesti and Eunhwa are lying side by side."
d_ex_hotel_12_69,"Oh, are you awake?"
d_ex_hotel_12_70,"Hehehe, that tickles!"
d_ex_hotel_12_71,"Really, Vesti!"
d_ex_hotel_12_72,"You have to stay still during a massage, you know."
d_ex_hotel_12_73,B-but...
d_ex_hotel_12_74,I can't help it... It's way too ticklish!
d_ex_hotel_12_75,Urgh...
d_ex_hotel_12_76,"Emma... ease up just a bit, will you?"
d_ex_hotel_12_77,"Oh my, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hurting since you kept holding back your voice."
d_ex_hotel_12_78,"Phew... Still, that really hit the spot. Good work."
d_ex_hotel_12_79,"Oh my, you're too kind!"
d_ex_hotel_12_80,"Hehe. Now then, looks like you're the only one left, Commander."
d_ex_hotel_12_81,Em-Emma. I have a good idea.
d_ex_hotel_12_82,Hmm? What is it?
d_ex_hotel_12_83,*Whisper whisper*
d_ex_hotel_12_84,Oh my! That's a wonderful idea!

d_ex_hotel_12_86,*Squeeze squeeze*
d_ex_hotel_12_87,*Press press*
d_ex_hotel_12_88,This feels pretty good...
d_ex_hotel_12_89,"Don't just stand there, Eunhwa. Come give me a hand, will you?"
d_ex_hotel_12_90,No.
d_ex_hotel_12_91,Why should I give him a massage?
d_ex_hotel_12_92,"Hehe, that's because this is a present for our Commander who's been working so hard!"
d_ex_hotel_12_93,"Hehe, I think I understand why you like massaging so much, Emma."
d_ex_hotel_12_94,It makes me happy to see the person enjoying the massage so much.
d_ex_hotel_12_95,"I know, right?"
d_ex_hotel_12_96,"Can you press a little harder, please?"
d_ex_hotel_12_97,"Oh, was that not hard enough?"
d_ex_hotel_12_98,"Okay. Just tell me if it hurts, all right?"
d_ex_hotel_12_99,Hmm... a bit harder?
d_ex_hotel_12_100,Like this?
d_ex_hotel_12_101,*Press press*
d_ex_hotel_12_102,*Press*
d_ex_hotel_12_103,*Crack*
d_ex_hotel_12_104,!!!
d_ex_hotel_12_105,... I-I don't think my body was supposed to make that sound.
d_ex_hotel_12_106,Oh no... wh-what do we do?
d_ex_hotel_12_107,"Commander, are you okay...?"
d_ex_hotel_12_108,"Here, let me take a look."
d_ex_hotel_12_109,Looks like this part is sunken...
d_ex_hotel_12_110,*Poke*
d_ex_hotel_12_111,Ow! That hurts!
d_ex_hotel_12_112,"C-Commander, l-let me help you..."
d_ex_hotel_12_113,"No, Vesti! Don't touch him there anymore!"
d_ex_hotel_12_114,...
d_ex_hotel_12_115,"... On second thought, this does seem kind of fun."
d_ex_hotel_12_116,W-wait...!
d_ex_hotel_12_117,"In an instant, I'm surrounded by all three of them."
d_ex_hotel_12_118,It seems that I can't get away until the massage is over.

d_ex_shopping_11_5,"Hehe, hi there!"
d_ex_shopping_11_6,"Well, what do we have here? Weakling"
d_ex_shopping_11_7,and that little kid from School Circle.
d_ex_shopping_11_8,"Whoa, you actually remembered me? Cool! How've you been?"
d_ex_shopping_11_9,Not bad.
d_ex_shopping_11_10,Something bothering you?

d_ex_shopping_11_12,A gift? Who's it for?

d_ex_shopping_11_18,... It's just I've never seen you pick out a gift before.
d_ex_shopping_11_19,*Sigh* They say they want to do a gift exchange this time.
d_ex_shopping_11_20,"I'm not really into it, but I guess there's no helping it."
d_ex_shopping_11_21,"Uh... Sorry for butting in,"
d_ex_shopping_11_22,but have you figured out what you're gonna buy?
d_ex_shopping_11_23,"No, as you can see, I haven't the slightest clue."
d_ex_shopping_11_24,*Sigh*...
d_ex_shopping_11_25,"I've always just been on the receiving end, so I'm not used to giving gifts."
d_ex_shopping_11_26,... Makes me think I should reflect on that.
d_ex_shopping_11_27,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_11_28,"Hehe! All right, Eunhwa,"
d_ex_shopping_11_29,I'll help ya out!
d_ex_shopping_11_30,You?
d_ex_shopping_11_31,"Yep! Believe it or not, I'm still in high school,"
d_ex_shopping_11_32,so I've done gift exchanges like a million times.
d_ex_shopping_11_33,"Oh, sounds good to me."
d_ex_shopping_11_34,Let's give it a shot.
d_ex_shopping_11_35,I'm counting on you.
d_ex_shopping_11_36,"Hmm, so to sum it up,"
d_ex_shopping_11_37,"anything goes, as long as it can leave a memory for the three of you. Is that right?"
d_ex_shopping_11_38,"Yeah, that's what they said."
d_ex_shopping_11_39,Let's see... memory... memory... hmm.
d_ex_shopping_11_40,Oh!
d_ex_shopping_11_41,Did you think of something?
d_ex_shopping_11_42,"Hehe, of course!"
d_ex_shopping_11_43,"C'mon, follow me for a sec! I just came up with the most brilliant idea!"
d_ex_shopping_11_44,*Tap tap tap tap*
d_ex_shopping_11_45,"As soon as Ein finishes talking, she darts off."
d_ex_shopping_11_46,"Are you sure we can trust that kid, Weakling?"
d_ex_shopping_11_47,I can vouch for her.
d_ex_shopping_11_48,Here it is!
d_ex_shopping_11_49,"How's that? Pretty awesome, right?"
d_ex_shopping_11_50,What the...
d_ex_shopping_11_51,I didn't even know this place existed.
d_ex_shopping_11_52,Ein has brought us to
d_ex_shopping_11_53,"a machine that can custom print all sorts of things: t-shirts, keychains, phone cases, and more."
d_ex_shopping_11_54,Why don't you try making something here?
d_ex_shopping_11_55,"I come here all the time with my seniors, and everything always comes out super cute. The quality's really good too!"
d_ex_shopping_11_56,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_11_57,Not bad at all.
d_ex_shopping_11_58,What do I need to do?
d_ex_shopping_11_59,Okay... First!
d_ex_shopping_11_60,Decide what item you want to make.
d_ex_shopping_11_61,I'll go with the keychain.
d_ex_shopping_11_62,Is there a design you want?
d_ex_shopping_11_63,... Design?
d_ex_shopping_11_64,Hmm...
d_ex_shopping_11_65,Would a photo work?
d_ex_shopping_11_66,Of course!
d_ex_shopping_11_67,Okay... here you go.
d_ex_shopping_11_68,*Flutter*
d_ex_shopping_11_69,Eunhwa pulls out a photo from her pocket.
d_ex_shopping_11_70,"Whoa, is that a pic of the Absolute Squad?"
d_ex_shopping_11_71,It must mean a lot to you.
d_ex_shopping_11_72,...
d_ex_shopping_11_73,Stop talking nonsense.
d_ex_shopping_11_74,*Whirrrr*
d_ex_shopping_11_75,*Thud*
d_ex_shopping_11_76,*Thump*
d_ex_shopping_11_77,The end product is a round keychain
d_ex_shopping_11_78,featuring the three members of the Absolute Squad.
d_ex_shopping_11_79,"Oh my gosh, that's way too cute!"
d_ex_shopping_11_80,Do you like it?
d_ex_shopping_11_81,...
d_ex_shopping_11_82,Eunhwa?
d_ex_shopping_11_83,!
d_ex_shopping_11_84,"Uh... yeah, sure."
d_ex_shopping_11_85,I suppose it's not bad.
d_ex_shopping_11_86,Right?
d_ex_shopping_11_87,"Hehe, it kind of makes me proud seeing how happy you are."
d_ex_shopping_11_88,Same here.
d_ex_shopping_11_89,This really takes a load off my mind.
d_ex_shopping_11_90,"Weakling, you did well."
d_ex_shopping_11_91,"You too, Eunhwa."
d_ex_shopping_11_92,"You, as well."
d_ex_shopping_11_93,...
d_ex_shopping_11_94,?
d_ex_shopping_11_95,Oh! M-me?
d_ex_shopping_11_96,"Yes, you."
d_ex_shopping_11_97,Thanks for today.
d_ex_shopping_11_98,You really helped me out.
d_ex_shopping_11_99,!!
d_ex_shopping_11_100,W-wow!
d_ex_shopping_11_101,Did I just get a compliment from Absolute Squad? I-incredible!
d_ex_shopping_11_102,I'll be sure to return the favor if I ever get the chance.
d_ex_shopping_11_103,Really? You mean it? No take backs!
d_ex_shopping_11_104,"Whoa, is this for real?"
d_ex_shopping_11_105,"I'm not dreaming, right?"
d_ex_shopping_11_106,*Squeezeee*
d_ex_shopping_11_107,Ein pinches her own cheeks.
d_ex_shopping_11_108,"Ow, that hurts!"
d_ex_shopping_11_109,I gotta get back and brag to the seniors!
d_ex_shopping_11_110,Teacher! I'm off now! See you next time!
d_ex_shopping_11_111,Their meeting today
d_ex_shopping_11_112,leads each of them to spend a happy day in their own way.

d_ex_theater_11_1,Ta-da-da-daa! ♪
d_ex_theater_11_2,"Hello, everyone!"
d_ex_theater_11_3,"I'm Crust, your host of the Crunchy Cooking Class!!"
d_ex_theater_11_4,Woohoo!
d_ex_theater_11_5,"Whoa there, Mr. Gourmand."
d_ex_theater_11_6,"You don't have to respond to every single thing, you know. Hehe."
d_ex_theater_11_7,"Hehe, Commander, have you already forgotten?"
d_ex_theater_11_8,This is just a rehearsal.
d_ex_theater_11_9,Oh... I didn't even realize.
d_ex_theater_11_10,"You know, standing up here on the stage like this really makes it feel like the real thing."
d_ex_theater_11_11,I never thought I'd be able to see the whole audience so clearly.
d_ex_theater_11_12,"Hehe, don't be nervous! Just do it like you always do, and everything will be fine!"
d_ex_theater_11_13,Hmm… but is it really okay for someone like me to be on this show?
d_ex_theater_11_14,I always thought only skilled pros came on this show.
d_ex_theater_11_15,"Nah, that's not always the case!"
d_ex_theater_11_16,Anyone who loves cooking
d_ex_theater_11_17,can appear on the Crunchy Cooking Class!
d_ex_theater_11_18,"Hehe, I'm glad to hear that!"
d_ex_theater_11_19,"Now then, what recipe will we be making today?"
d_ex_theater_11_20,I found this soup recipe in a cookbook.
d_ex_theater_11_21,What do you think? Does it sound good?
d_ex_theater_11_22,"Oh, that's a great choice!"
d_ex_theater_11_23,"Emma, why don't you get started with the recipe?"
d_ex_theater_11_24,I'll help you out as we go!
d_ex_theater_11_25,"Hehe. All right then, I'll be counting on you."
d_ex_theater_11_26,"First, we chop up all the ingredients..."
d_ex_theater_11_27,*Chop chop chop chop*
d_ex_theater_11_28,Then stir fry everything on low heat for... 10 minutes?
d_ex_theater_11_29,"Hmm... Now that I think about it, we might be a little short on time."
d_ex_theater_11_30,*Fssshhhhh*
d_ex_theater_11_31,Maybe it's okay to just stir-fry on high heat for 3 minutes?
d_ex_theater_11_32,Huh? What was that...?
d_ex_theater_11_33,W-wait a second!
d_ex_theater_11_34,"Oh my gosh, I'm such a scatterbrain!"
d_ex_theater_11_35,I can't believe I forgot the salt.
d_ex_theater_11_36,Let's see...
d_ex_theater_11_37,*Pop*
d_ex_theater_11_38,"Since soy sauce's salty, it could be a good substitute."
d_ex_theater_11_39,Ah! W-wait!
d_ex_theater_11_40,I-I've got salt right here!
d_ex_theater_11_41,"While cooking her own version of the soup, Crust simultaneously stops Emma from making any changes to hers."
d_ex_theater_11_42,*Gasp gasp*
d_ex_theater_11_43,"Wow, incredible..."
d_ex_theater_11_44,"And last but not least, we drizzle some sauce on top and let it simmer..."
d_ex_theater_11_45,*Bubble bubble*
d_ex_theater_11_46,Phew...
d_ex_theater_11_47,I-it's finally almost over...
d_ex_theater_11_48,You worked hard.
d_ex_theater_11_49,"The cooking process has had its ups and downs,"
d_ex_theater_11_50,but the soup Emma is nearly finished with looks absolutely mouthwatering.
d_ex_theater_11_51,"Hehe, a professional's guidance really does make all the difference."
d_ex_theater_11_52,I've never seen soup look this good.
d_ex_theater_11_53,And to think I made it! I'm really proud of myself.
d_ex_theater_11_54,"Hehe, I'm so glad you said that, Emma. It makes me feel proud too."
d_ex_theater_11_55,I'll remember everything you taught me.
d_ex_theater_11_56,"Someday, I want to make it myself for the Commander."
d_ex_theater_11_57,"Ahem, Crust."
d_ex_theater_11_58,Yes?
d_ex_theater_11_59,I'm really grateful.
d_ex_theater_11_60,Huh? Why are you saying that all of a sudden...
d_ex_theater_11_61,*Bubble bubble*
d_ex_theater_11_62,*Sizzle*
d_ex_theater_11_63,Gah! Mr. Gourmand!
d_ex_theater_11_64,M-my soup's boiling over!
d_ex_theater_11_65,"Qu-quick, turn down the heat!"
d_ex_theater_11_66,"Phew, that was close!"
d_ex_theater_11_67,Good thing it didn't overflow too much.
d_ex_theater_11_68,I'm glad the food is okay.
d_ex_theater_11_69,"Hehe, I think the food's mostly done now."
d_ex_theater_11_70,So shall we start serving it up?
d_ex_theater_11_71,"Okay, sounds good!"
d_ex_theater_11_72,So first...
d_ex_theater_11_73,... Huh?
d_ex_theater_11_74,Is something wrong?
d_ex_theater_11_75,!!!
d_ex_theater_11_76,How... how can this be?
d_ex_theater_11_77,"I only looked away for a moment,"
d_ex_theater_11_78,but the stuff boiling in Emma's pot has completely changed!
d_ex_theater_11_79,*Glub glub*
d_ex_theater_11_80,"M-Mr. Gourmand,"
d_ex_theater_11_81,"I'm not seeing things, am I?"
d_ex_theater_11_82,Only a few moments ago...
d_ex_theater_11_83,...
d_ex_theater_11_84,Hmm? What's everyone up to?
d_ex_theater_11_85,"Hehe, the food's gonna get cold. Let's hurry and serve it up."
d_ex_theater_11_86,"Uh, Emma… What's going on?"
d_ex_theater_11_87,Isn't there something a bit... different about your dish?
d_ex_theater_11_88,"Oh, right!"
d_ex_theater_11_89,"Since it's a cream-based soup, I thought it might be a bit too rich."
d_ex_theater_11_90,So I tried adding a smidgen of red and black pepper.
d_ex_theater_11_91,O-only a smidgen?
d_ex_theater_11_92,Are you... sure about that?
d_ex_theater_11_93,*Bubble bubble*
d_ex_theater_11_94,"Smoke with a pungent, acrid smell rises from the soup that has turned a dark color."
d_ex_theater_11_95,... She got us.
d_ex_theater_11_96,"Hehe, come on, let's move on to the next part!"
d_ex_theater_11_97,Huh? Ne-next part?
d_ex_theater_11_98,"If it's the next part I know of, then I'm sure..."
d_ex_theater_11_99,"Yes, that's right!"
d_ex_theater_11_100,The part where the guest shares their dish with the audience...
d_ex_theater_11_101,Oh no...
d_ex_theater_11_102,This is the part I've been looking forward to the most!
d_ex_theater_11_103,Urp... bleeeeech!
d_ex_theater_11_104,Bleeeeech!
d_ex_theater_11_105,"During the actual filming of the show, it's Crust who ends up doing all the cooking."
d_ex_theater_11_106,"Following Emma's recipe, Crust creates a spicy creamy soup that's a hit among the audience."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_title,Preparing for the Party
d_ex_clothingstore_11_1,Hmm...
d_ex_clothingstore_11_2,Hmmmmm...
d_ex_clothingstore_11_3,This one's not bad at all.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_4,It's cute.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_5,Huh?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_6,"On second thought, this one might be even better..."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_7,Mmm... what a dilemma.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_8,"Um, Emma."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_9,Hmm?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_10,"You called, Commander?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_11,Why did you bring me along to pick out clothes?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_12,"There's a pajama party this weekend,"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_13,so I'm picking out some PJs to wear then.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_14,"I heard this place is having a special sale on pajamas, so I couldn't just sit back and do nothing!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_15,I wanted to buy some as gifts to surprise Vesti and Eunhwa!
d_ex_clothingstore_11_16,"Ah, I see."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_17,I've narrowed down the options somewhat.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_18,Want to take a look?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_19,Emma holds up two sets of pajamas.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_20,"Hehe, what do you think?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_21,I thought one of these might suit Vesti.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_22,Which one do you prefer?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_23,The one with yellow polka dots.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_24,The one with sky-blue polka dots.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_25,"Oh my! Commander, you and I think alike!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_26,This color reminds me of a baby chick! It's so cute!
d_ex_clothingstore_11_27,"This pastel blue is just so pretty, isn't it?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_28,I think it'll match Vesti's eyes wonderfully.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_29,"Hehe, I knew having you come along would make things go more smoothly."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_30,"If I'd come alone, I'd probably have wasted so much time trying to make a decision."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_31,"Next is Eunhwa, right?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_32,"Yes, that's right."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_33,I'm torn between these two.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_34,Can you pick for me again?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_35,The sky-blue nightgown.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_36,The pink nightgown.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_37,"Yeah, it's probably best to stick with the colors she usually wears."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_38,Eunhwa likes what's familiar.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_39,"Okay, this one looks like a good choice."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_40,"Oh, what a bold choice!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_41,I don't think I've ever seen Eunhwa wear pink before.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_42,I think it might be good to try something new.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_43,"Hehe, that should cover the gifts for both of them!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_44,I hope they like it.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_45,I'm sure they will.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_46,They'll like it even more when they hear that you helped pick them out.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_47,"Thanks for helping, Commander."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_48,Glad to help.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_49,But you're only buying two sets?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_50,"What about yours, Emma?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_51,"Oh, mine?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_52,I'm not going to wear any pajamas.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_53,... What?!
d_ex_clothingstore_11_54,Haha.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_55,"You should see your face, Commander. You're beet red."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_56,!!
d_ex_clothingstore_11_57,"Hehe, I'm just kidding!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_58,"You're really cute when you're like this, Commander."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_59,"Actually, I already bought my clothes, but thanks for worrying about me."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_60,"... If you've bought everything, let's go."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_61,Hmm?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_62,But I actually need to buy one more.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_63,Didn't you get everything earlier?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_64,Hmm...
d_ex_clothingstore_11_65,"Commander, don't tell me you forgot!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_66,"If that's really the case, I might have to be a little disappointed in you."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_67,Huh? Am I missing something...?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_68,We're planning on having a pajama party at the dorm soon.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_69,"Do you want to come too, Commander?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_70,I don't have any pajamas.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_71,"Oh my, really?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_72,"Then this time, we'll get you one as a gift."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_73,"Hehe, I wonder what kind of pajamas would suit you best, Commander?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_74,Ah...
d_ex_clothingstore_11_75,We've scheduled it for this weekend.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_76,"... Right, sorry. I remember now."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_77,That's great.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_78,Vesti was suuuper excited about this.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_79,"If you don't show up, she probably will cry her eyes out!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_80,That was a close call.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_81,Thanks for letting me know.
d_ex_clothingstore_11_82,"Hehe, Commander,"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_83,"then as a reward for letting you know,"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_84,can I pick out your pajamas?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_85,"Yeah, of course."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_86,"Hehe, okay then!"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_87,"No takebacks, all right?"
d_ex_clothingstore_11_88,?
d_ex_clothingstore_11_89,"Afterwards, I had to attend the party wearing somewhat shocking pajamas."
d_ex_clothingstore_11_90,"Even so, the four of us end up making unforgettable memories together."

d_ex_gym_11_9,"So, what do you think after seeing it yourself?"
d_ex_gym_11_10,M-magnificent...!
d_ex_gym_11_11,"I, Novel, would gladly become Ade's apprentice this very instant!"
d_ex_gym_11_12,But why the sudden interest in martial arts?
d_ex_gym_11_13,"Your specialty is intelligence-based warfare, after all."
d_ex_gym_11_14,"Ahem, Watson."
d_ex_gym_11_15,That's a case of knowing only half the story.
d_ex_gym_11_16,"To take on a strong criminal, one must also be skilled in hand-to-hand combat."
d_ex_gym_11_17,Even Sherlock Holmes learned a martial art called Bartitsu!
d_ex_gym_11_18,Phew...
d_ex_gym_11_19,"Will this do, Miss Novel?"
d_ex_gym_11_20,"Yes, that's more than enough."
d_ex_gym_11_21,"... Ade, I have a favor to ask!"
d_ex_gym_11_22,Yes?
d_ex_gym_11_23,"Take me on as your apprentice, I beg of you!"
d_ex_gym_11_24,"... I would be glad to teach you, though I must admit I am still at a rather basic level."
d_ex_gym_11_25,Would that be acceptable to you?
d_ex_gym_11_26,"As long as it makes me stronger, I don't care what it takes!"
d_ex_gym_11_27,What I want is for you to teach me the very foundations
d_ex_gym_11_28,of your secret agent skills!
d_ex_gym_11_29,...
d_ex_gym_11_30,"Then, if I may pose just one question."
d_ex_gym_11_31,Yeah! What is it?
d_ex_gym_11_32,Even the most basic training may prove to be a rather grueling ordeal.
d_ex_gym_11_33,And I may not quite be myself during training.
d_ex_gym_11_34,... Do you truly believe you can endure it?
d_ex_gym_11_35,Of course!
d_ex_gym_11_36,No matter what hardship may come?
d_ex_gym_11_37,No matter what hardships I face!
d_ex_gym_11_38,"As long as I can become stronger, I don't care!"

d_ex_gym_11_50,... I-I'm coming.
d_ex_gym_11_51,"We met up at noon, and already dusk is falling outside."
d_ex_gym_11_52,"Now then, Miss Novel,"

d_ex_gym_11_67,it fills me with such pride.
d_ex_gym_11_68,"At this level, I could take down anyone with ease!"
d_ex_gym_11_69,"I can't thank you enough, Ade!"
d_ex_gym_11_70,"Think nothing of it, Miss Novel. It was only possible because you followed so well."
d_ex_gym_11_71,"Haha! Now that both my mind and body are strengthened,"
d_ex_gym_11_72,"I, Novel, shall go ahead and make my exit!"
d_ex_gym_11_73,*Swoosh swoosh swoosh*
d_ex_gym_11_74,"Bubbling with excitement, Novel shadowboxes her way to the front door."
d_ex_gym_11_75,*Crack!*
d_ex_gym_11_76,Huh? What the...?
d_ex_gym_11_77,?
d_ex_gym_11_78,What's that sound?
d_ex_gym_11_79,Ugh... oww...
d_ex_gym_11_80,W-Watson? Ade?
d_ex_gym_11_81,C-could you... help me for a moment?
d_ex_gym_11_82,My b-body... won't move...!
d_ex_gym_11_83,Miss Novel...!
d_ex_gym_11_84,"We lay down Novel, who has frozen in place while standing, and begin administering first aid."
d_ex_gym_11_85,... I believe this should suffice.
d_ex_gym_11_86,*Twitch twitch*
d_ex_gym_11_87,Ugh... uggghh...
d_ex_gym_11_88,"Don't move, Novel."
d_ex_gym_11_89,I-I think... I'll survive.
d_ex_gym_11_90,"I just want to say thank you, Watson. Thank you, Ade."
d_ex_gym_11_91,Miss Novel... are you quite all right?
d_ex_gym_11_92,Of course!
d_ex_gym_11_93,"If it makes me stronger, this little sacrifice is nothing...!"
d_ex_gym_11_94,... As I thought.
d_ex_gym_11_95,"Indeed, you have set your mind firmly,"
d_ex_gym_11_96,so I must not let my own resolve weaken here.
d_ex_gym_11_97,... Eh?
d_ex_gym_11_98,You mean there's more?
d_ex_gym_11_99,"Hehe, indeed."
d_ex_gym_11_100,I shall ensure that you are fully recovered
d_ex_gym_11_101,before we proceed to your next session.
d_ex_gym_11_102,??
d_ex_gym_11_103,"A-Ade, what do you mean by"
d_ex_gym_11_104,"""next session""? Didn't we finish all the training?"
d_ex_gym_11_105,Perish the thought!
d_ex_gym_11_106,"Basic training lasts no less than a month, and may extend to three at most."
d_ex_gym_11_107,!!!
d_ex_gym_11_108,"Hehe, do take the opportunity to rest thoroughly while you still may."
d_ex_gym_11_109,Our evening session is scheduled to commence shortly.
d_ex_gym_11_110,... Can-cancel it.
d_ex_gym_11_111,Excuse me?
d_ex_gym_11_112,Cancel it! I want to cancel it!
d_ex_gym_11_113,I don't care if I never get stronger!
d_ex_gym_11_114,"Please, just spare me!"
d_ex_gym_11_115,"That day, Novel's screams echo throughout the fitness club."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_title,Show Me Your True Feelings
d_ex_maidcafe_12_1,"On a quiet day off, I get a text from Privaty."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_2,She says she's heard the Maid Cafe's sales are skyrocketing and wants to visit to check things out.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_3,*Zing*
d_ex_maidcafe_12_4,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_5,*Looks around* *Looks around*
d_ex_maidcafe_12_6,Hmm...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_7,Doesn't look like there's anything unusual?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_8,Yeah.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_9,... But how is it that sales are higher than when I was here?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_10,It seems no different from usual...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_11,Are you jealous?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_12,N-no way!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_13,"I work for the Central Government, so why the heck would I be jealous?!"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_14,"I-I only help out occasionally, it's not like I actually work as a maid..."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_15,... I see.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_16,"Welcome back, Master, Miss."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_17,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_18,You are...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_19,Miss... Privaty?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_20,And the person beside you is...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_21,Hello.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_22,!!!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_23,M-M-Master?!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_24,Th-this is most unexpected! What brings you here...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_25,"I heard sales went up, so I thought I'd come check it out."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_26,I-I... see.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_27,"... Very well, then. Allow me to show you to your seat."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_28,"This way, please..."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_29,Hold on a sec.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_30,"Ade, what the heck are you wearing?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_31,"Oh, this outfit, you ask?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_32,We will soon be holding a bunny girl event at the Maid Cafe.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_33,Consider this a sort of rehearsal...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_34,I am most pleased to see that our esteemed guests are enjoying themselves so thoroughly...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_35,... How disappointing.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_36,I beg your pardon?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_37,I-I'm so disappointed!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_38,T-to think you'd try to lure in customers with such indecent clothing...!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_39,Whatever happened to your pride as a maid?!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_40,M-Miss Privaty...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_41,It's a misunderstanding. Th-this is not as it appears...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_42,"Privaty, calm down."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_43,Calm down?! How am I supposed to stay calm when even Ade has changed?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_44,Ade used to be the very embodiment of what it meant to be a proper maid!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_45,"... If I have caused you any displeasure, I humbly apologize."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_46,Might I beg you to grant me but a single chance—
d_ex_maidcafe_12_47,a chance to prove that I remain unchanged?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_48,... Hmph.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_49,Fine.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_50,Then show me that you're still serious about this.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_51,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_52,"Understood, Miss Privaty."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_53,"From this moment, I shall devote myself entirely to serving you."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_54,"This way, if you please."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_55,"Master, Miss Privaty, your meal is ready."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_56,... I'll leave it to you.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_57,*Clack clack*
d_ex_maidcafe_12_58,"Not long after we place our order, the table is lavishly filled with a variety of sumptuous dishes."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_59,"Bunny omurice, bunny parfait, bunny cake—new menu items that seem to be made with care."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_60,Whoa...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_61,...!!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_62,"These dishes are the fruit of several sleepless nights of research—undertaken together with Cocoa and Soda, of course."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_63,I do hope they are to your liking.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_64,"... Well, it's not entirely unpleasant."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_65,A-ahem...!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_66,W-well then... allow me to recite the spell to make it delicious.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_67,Ah...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_68,Uh... C-could you both maybe not stare at me like that...?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_69,Ade's face turns bright red as she tightly shuts her eyes and starts chanting a spell.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_70,Become delicious...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_71,B-become delicious...!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_72,"I don't know if it's intentional or merely a coincidence,"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_73,but Ade's clumsy execution of the spell—so unlike her usual perfectionism—somehow makes my heart flutter even more.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_74,The regulars must feel the same way.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_75,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_76,... I'd say she passes.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_77,Now I get why sales have gone up.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_78,Ah...!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_79,Th-thank you very much... Master!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_80,"What about you, Privaty?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_81,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_82,... Fine.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_83,I'll admit it.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_84,"You really haven't changed, Ade."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_85,"In fact, seeing you in that outfit makes your sincerity stand out even more."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_86,Oh...!
d_ex_maidcafe_12_87,"M-my deepest thanks, Miss Privaty."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_88,And thanks.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_89,For putting up with our unreasonable demands when we just barged in like that.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_90,"Please do not speak so, Miss Privaty."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_91,"If your misunderstanding has been resolved, then I am most relieved."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_92,What a heartwarming ending.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_93,"Um... Ade,"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_94,there's something I'd like to ask you...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_95,"Yes, what might it be?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_96,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_97,"So... you'll be needing more hands to get the event ready, right?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_98,I-it just so happens I've got some free time lately.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_99,"If you really needed someone, I suppose I could help."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_100,...
d_ex_maidcafe_12_101,Wh-what's with that look?
d_ex_maidcafe_12_102,"I-I'm telling you this with the best of intentions, okay?"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_103,"Hehe, but naturally."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_104,"With Miss Privaty's assistance, I would feel most reassured."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_105,I knew it.
d_ex_maidcafe_12_106,"If you ever need help, give me a shout."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_107,"I could totally pull off a bunny girl, no problem!"
d_ex_maidcafe_12_108,"Hehe. Yes, I shall be in touch with you soon."
d_ex_maidcafe_12_109,"... In the near future, we just might witness the birth of a brand-new bunny girl maid."
d_ex_modernbar_12_title,Bunny Girl Afterparty
d_ex_modernbar_12_1,"I have plans to meet Ade and Milk today, so I hurry toward the bar."
d_ex_modernbar_12_2,*Zing*
d_ex_modernbar_12_3,"Sorry, I'm late."
d_ex_modernbar_12_4,P-Pal?
d_ex_modernbar_12_5,Wh-what's the deal with you?! Why're you so late?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_6,"Sorry, I got held up at work."
d_ex_modernbar_12_7,"Welcome, Master. I've been awaiting your arrival."
d_ex_modernbar_12_8,Countless bottles are scattered across the table.
d_ex_modernbar_12_9,... Looks like you've had quite a bit already.
d_ex_modernbar_12_10,"Hehe, fret not, for I am as well as ever."
d_ex_modernbar_12_11,"By the way, what's with your outfits?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_12,Wha...? W-well that's 'cause of you...
d_ex_modernbar_12_13,"Phew, finally, it's over."
d_ex_modernbar_12_14,"Hey, guys, you up for an afterparty later?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_15,Ah...! That sounds wonderful.
d_ex_modernbar_12_16,Count me in.
d_ex_modernbar_12_17,"Good, that's all settled?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_18,Haaah... I can finally get to rip this suffocating thing off.
d_ex_modernbar_12_19,Would be nice to see it again at the afterparty.
d_ex_modernbar_12_20,Huh...? Wh-what did you say?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_21,"It's a bunny girl afterparty, so of course you wear a bunny outfit."
d_ex_modernbar_12_22,"... Anyway, she probably won't wear it."
d_ex_modernbar_12_23,"... Well, I guess I'll think about it."
d_ex_modernbar_12_24,...
d_ex_modernbar_12_25,I didn't expect you'd actually wear it...
d_ex_modernbar_12_26,Wh-what?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_27,So we were the only ones taking this seriously?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_28,Ugh... Ughhhhh...!
d_ex_modernbar_12_29,"... I must admit, I was momentarily deceived."
d_ex_modernbar_12_30,"... Sorry, I feel really bad about this."
d_ex_modernbar_12_31,"But really, why'd you drink so much?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_32,How am I supposed to keep my cool in this thing?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_33,"You didn't show up for ages, and I was about to die of embarrassment. So yeah, I had to drink a little!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_34,"Miss Milk, are you quite all right?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_35,Your face looks as though it might explode...
d_ex_modernbar_12_36,"Huh? I'm perfectly fine, okay?!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_37,"An-and besides, who's worrying about who here?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_38,"Ade, you drank just as much as I did!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_39,"Th-that may be so, but..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_40,"C'mon, sit your butt down, Pal! Let's go at it together!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_41,Cheers!
d_ex_modernbar_12_42,Cheers!
d_ex_modernbar_12_43,Cheers.
d_ex_modernbar_12_44,*Gulp gulp*
d_ex_modernbar_12_45,Ahh.
d_ex_modernbar_12_46,Hoho. An evening drink with everyone is quite the delight.
d_ex_modernbar_12_47,"Hahaha, Pal! Come on over and have another!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_48,"The number of empty bottles on the table keeps piling up,"
d_ex_modernbar_12_49,but Ade's face remains unchanged.
d_ex_modernbar_12_50,On the other hand...
d_ex_modernbar_12_51,Mmm... Ugghh...
d_ex_modernbar_12_52,"... Milk, you're getting pretty drunk."
d_ex_modernbar_12_53,N-no way!
d_ex_modernbar_12_54,I-I'm not drunk at all...!
d_ex_modernbar_12_55,J-just one more... urgh...
d_ex_modernbar_12_56,*Thud*
d_ex_modernbar_12_57,Milk falls face-down onto the table.
d_ex_modernbar_12_58,... My goodness.
d_ex_modernbar_12_59,*Rustle*
d_ex_modernbar_12_60,Ade pulls out a blanket—from somewhere I have no idea—and gently drapes it over Milk.
d_ex_modernbar_12_61,... I do hope this will keep her comfortable until she awakens.
d_ex_modernbar_12_62,"You seem perfectly fine, Ade."
d_ex_modernbar_12_63,"I simply cannot allow myself to be the first to succumb, certainly not before Master or Miss Milk."
d_ex_modernbar_12_64,"How are you feeling, Master?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_65,"Yeah, let's drink a little more."
d_ex_modernbar_12_66,...
d_ex_modernbar_12_67,!!
d_ex_modernbar_12_68,... I must have dozed off for a bit.
d_ex_modernbar_12_69,I open my eyes and see Milk slumped over the table.
d_ex_modernbar_12_70,Zzzzz...
d_ex_modernbar_12_71,Where's Ade?
d_ex_modernbar_12_72,U-ugh...
d_ex_modernbar_12_73,?
d_ex_modernbar_12_74,I hear someone's voice near my ear.
d_ex_modernbar_12_75,"While it delights me that you wish to lean on me so, Master..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_76,y-you are just a bit too close at the moment...
d_ex_modernbar_12_77,i-if you might step back just a little...!
d_ex_modernbar_12_78,"Oh, sorry..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_79,Ah... that feels much better now.
d_ex_modernbar_12_80,"I do appreciate your concern, Master."
d_ex_modernbar_12_81,"No, I should be the one thanking you. It's been a while since I had this much fun."
d_ex_modernbar_12_82,Ah...! I'm so glad to hear that. That puts my mind at ease.
d_ex_modernbar_12_83,...
d_ex_modernbar_12_84,"Then, perhaps for... as well..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_85,Hmm?
d_ex_modernbar_12_86,"... If the opportunity arises again, I would be delighted to serve you in this manner once more..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_87,*Bang!*
d_ex_modernbar_12_88,"Hey, you punks!"
d_ex_modernbar_12_89,Getting all lovey-dovey without me!
d_ex_modernbar_12_90,A-are you for real...?!
d_ex_modernbar_12_91,*Thud*
d_ex_modernbar_12_92,...
d_ex_modernbar_12_93,... I should probably head back.
d_ex_modernbar_12_94,"Understood, Master."
d_ex_modernbar_12_95,Ade scoops Milk up into her arms.
d_ex_modernbar_12_96,Ade...!
d_ex_modernbar_12_97,"Hoho. Please, don't be too surprised."
d_ex_modernbar_12_98,"I may have had a bit to drink, but carrying a young lady is no trouble at all."
d_ex_modernbar_12_99,"No, it's just... lifting Milk so suddenly might..."
d_ex_modernbar_12_100,Mmm... Ugghh...
d_ex_modernbar_12_101,"Ah, Miss Milk, have you regained consciousness?"
d_ex_modernbar_12_102,Ugh... Ugh.
d_ex_modernbar_12_103,Ugh?
d_ex_modernbar_12_104,Hnggh...
d_ex_modernbar_12_105,Bleeaaaargh!
d_ex_modernbar_12_106,...
d_ex_modernbar_12_107,"After sobering up, Milk apologizes."
d_ex_modernbar_12_108,"Meanwhile, Ade and I spend quite a while cleaning up the mess Milk left behind."
d_ex_police_10_title,Bunny Girl vs Maid
d_ex_police_10_1,"One day, I stop by the police station to pick up some important documents."
d_ex_police_10_2,"But there, instead of the A.C.P.U., I find only two completely unexpected faces."
d_ex_police_10_3,Does that even make sense?
d_ex_police_10_4,Showing up at a police station in that outfit and claiming it's for an investigation?
d_ex_police_10_5,Who'd ever believe that?
d_ex_police_10_6,"Oh, that's rich coming from you."
d_ex_police_10_7,"Look who's talking, you little punk!"
d_ex_police_10_8,Parading around in that shameless getup and claiming you're on duty.
d_ex_police_10_9,As if anyone would buy that!
d_ex_police_10_10,Sh-shameless?!
d_ex_police_10_11,This outfit is worn solely to serve Master! There's absolutely nothing shameful about it!
d_ex_police_10_12,... What are you two doing?
d_ex_police_10_13,M-Master...!
d_ex_police_10_14,"Hey, Pal. You came just in time."
d_ex_police_10_15,"Talk some sense into this blockhead, will you? She's completely uptight, unlike what she's wearing."
d_ex_police_10_16,And tell her I'm not doing anything shady!
d_ex_police_10_17,"Who exactly are you calling ""uptight""?!"
d_ex_police_10_18,You show up at a police station in a bunny girl outfit...
d_ex_police_10_19,Do you not realize how ridiculously suspicious you look right now?!
d_ex_police_10_20,Don't tell me you actually walk around the Outpost dressed like that?
d_ex_police_10_21,"I already told you! I'm only wearing this for a mission, got it? That's it!"
d_ex_police_10_22,"Both of you, calm down."
d_ex_police_10_23,"First, why don't you share why you came to the police station?"
d_ex_police_10_24,"Fine, let's start with that one first."
d_ex_police_10_25,"All right, then. Let's get this over with."
d_ex_police_10_26,"Then, let's start with you, Milk."
d_ex_police_10_27,I came here to dig up some info on a target.
d_ex_police_10_28,"While I was working on the mission, I found out one of the target's lackeys is a wanted criminal."
d_ex_police_10_29,"And if someone's on the wanted list, where else would you check but the police station, right?"
d_ex_police_10_30,"So here I am, in the middle of digging through files,"
d_ex_police_10_31,when suddenly Privaty shows up out of nowhere and slaps cuffs on me.
d_ex_police_10_32,"Then, starts going off about how I look ""suspicious"" and she's taking me in."
d_ex_police_10_33,"Like, seriously? If anyone's suspicious, it's her—strutting into the police station in that shameless outfit."
d_ex_police_10_34,Wh-who do you think you're calling—
d_ex_police_10_35,"Calm down, guys. It's Privaty's turn to speak."
d_ex_police_10_36,Ugh... fine.
d_ex_police_10_37,I stopped by on my way to the Maid Cafe
d_ex_police_10_38,because Admi asked me to request A.C.P.U.'s cooperation.
d_ex_police_10_39,"But the moment I stepped into the station, I saw Milk doing something blatantly suspicious."
d_ex_police_10_40,So I told her to stop and said I'd take her in for questioning.
d_ex_police_10_41,Doing something suspicious...?
d_ex_police_10_42,A Nikke in a bunny girl outfit tampering with the devices inside the police station without authorization.
d_ex_police_10_43,Doesn't that seem suspicious to you?
d_ex_police_10_44,True that.
d_ex_police_10_45,Right?
d_ex_police_10_46,"Police stations and bunny girls… that's just a suspicious combo, no matter how you look at it."
d_ex_police_10_47,I've told you a dozen times! I'm only wearing this for the mission!
d_ex_police_10_48,"You could've changed before coming here, right?"
d_ex_police_10_49,There's absolutely no reason to be showing up here dressed like that.
d_ex_police_10_50,"Hey, I'm in a hurry, all right? There's no way I have time to change!"
d_ex_police_10_51,And what about you!? Don't you think *your* outfit is weird!?
d_ex_police_10_52,"You're just strutting around in that ridiculous, frilly thing like it's nothing!"
d_ex_police_10_53,I-I'm not ashamed in the slightest!
d_ex_police_10_54,"Compared to what you're wearing, mine's practically tame."
d_ex_police_10_55,"Oh, really now."
d_ex_police_10_56,"That thing's covered in ribbons and frills,"
d_ex_police_10_57,and the skirt's so short you'd give everyone a free show with one wrong move.
d_ex_police_10_58,"And if you're supposed to be a maid, what's with the cat ears and tail?"
d_ex_police_10_59,I'd never be caught dead in something that humiliating.
d_ex_police_10_60,H-how dare you...!
d_ex_police_10_61,You should take a good look at yourself!
d_ex_police_10_62,You've got rabbit ears and a tail too!
d_ex_police_10_63,And that outfit... it's practically skin-tight.
d_ex_police_10_64,"At least I'm wearing a skirt, so I'm clearly better off than you!"
d_ex_police_10_65,It's not like this is unusual or anything.
d_ex_police_10_66,Everyone else in Coin Rush is wearing the same thing too.
d_ex_police_10_67,Would you also feel embarrassed to be wearing a swimsuit at the pool?
d_ex_police_10_68,"I can't say I completely disagree, but—"
d_ex_police_10_69,... Wait a sec!
d_ex_police_10_70,"We're at the police station, not Coin Rush!"
d_ex_police_10_71,"This isn't the Maid Cafe either, you know!"
d_ex_police_10_72,"Still, my clothes are way better than whatever ridiculous thing you're wearing!"
d_ex_police_10_73,"Ha! What a joke! Compared to what you're wearing, my outfit's a hundred times better!"
d_ex_police_10_74,We're starting to get off track again...
d_ex_police_10_75,Grr...
d_ex_police_10_76,Ugh...
d_ex_police_10_77,"... All right, fine! Let's just ask Pal"
d_ex_police_10_78,whose outfit looks better?
d_ex_police_10_79,"That way, no one'll complain, right?"
d_ex_police_10_80,Huh...? Me?
d_ex_police_10_81,I trust Master will make a wise and fair judgment.
d_ex_police_10_82,So let's settle this debate once and for all.
d_ex_police_10_83,"Wait, hold on..."
d_ex_police_10_84,"You think my bunny outfit is better, right, Pal?"
d_ex_police_10_85,"Naturally, you prefer my maid outfit, don't you, Master?"
d_ex_police_10_86,"Um, well..."
d_ex_police_10_87,Pal!
d_ex_police_10_88,Master!
d_ex_police_10_89,...
d_ex_police_10_90,"Even after that, I have to keep trying to calm Privaty and Milk, who keep demanding answers from me."
d_ex_police_10_91,Their bickering only dies down once Poli returns and sorts things out.
d_ex_cafe_10_title,No Shame When It's for Missions
d_ex_cafe_10_1,"After completing the mission with Milk, we stop by a cafe before heading back."
d_ex_cafe_10_2,"And then, I encounter..."
d_ex_cafe_10_3,...
d_ex_cafe_10_4,...
d_ex_cafe_10_5,...
d_ex_cafe_10_6,...
d_ex_cafe_10_7,... Say something!
d_ex_cafe_10_8,"Anything at all, you punks!"
d_ex_cafe_10_9,"They say that when you've got too much to say, you end up saying nothing. Guess that's true."
d_ex_cafe_10_10,Hell if I know where to start.
d_ex_cafe_10_11,Agreed.
d_ex_cafe_10_12,Ugh...
d_ex_cafe_10_13,... Let me start by asking this.
d_ex_cafe_10_14,When did you put that outfit on?
d_ex_cafe_10_15,"Or rather, why are you wearing it?"
d_ex_cafe_10_16,And most importantly... who are you?
d_ex_cafe_10_17,"You idiots! It's me, Milk!"
d_ex_cafe_10_18,Lies.
d_ex_cafe_10_19,... What did you say?!
d_ex_cafe_10_20,Hair. Makeup. Clothes. All not Milk.
d_ex_cafe_10_21,Disguise. Obvious.
d_ex_cafe_10_22,Exactly. Milk wouldn't be caught dead in that getup.
d_ex_cafe_10_23,So I'll ask again.
d_ex_cafe_10_24,Who are you?
d_ex_cafe_10_25,"... Pal, help me out here."
d_ex_cafe_10_26,Can you explain to those guys why I'm in this ridiculous situation?
d_ex_cafe_10_27,"... At a glance, she might look like someone in disguise,"
d_ex_cafe_10_28,but this is definitely Milk right in front of you.
d_ex_cafe_10_29,Why are you adding fuel to the fire?!
d_ex_cafe_10_30,"Hmm... it's hard to believe, but if Partner says so, I'll hold off on making a judgment for now."
d_ex_cafe_10_31,"Still, gotta make sure you're really Milk."
d_ex_cafe_10_32,Answer. Verify.
d_ex_cafe_10_33,"*Sigh*... Fine, fine. Ask away!"
d_ex_cafe_10_34,"All right, then. Answer me this."
d_ex_cafe_10_35,What's the coffee-to-milk ratio in a milk coffee?
d_ex_cafe_10_36,1:10.
d_ex_cafe_10_37,...!!
d_ex_cafe_10_38,Milk. For sure!
d_ex_cafe_10_39,"No doubt about it. That's Milk, all right."
d_ex_cafe_10_40,So that's enough to verify her...?
d_ex_cafe_10_41,"All right, next question."
d_ex_cafe_10_42,Why are you in that bunny girl outfit?
d_ex_cafe_10_43,You think I like wearing this thing?
d_ex_cafe_10_44,"It's part of the mission, all right? I didn't have a choice..."
d_ex_cafe_10_45,Lies.
d_ex_cafe_10_46,No missions.
d_ex_cafe_10_47,"It's a secret mission. Secret, you hear?"
d_ex_cafe_10_48,"Pal, say something! We were on this mission together, weren't we?"
d_ex_cafe_10_49,She did work on a mission with me.
d_ex_cafe_10_50,Hmm...
d_ex_cafe_10_51,Super suspicious.
d_ex_cafe_10_52,That narrows it down to two possibilities:
d_ex_cafe_10_53,"Either you were really out on some classified mission,"
d_ex_cafe_10_54,or you're just making excuses after sneaking off to do something else.
d_ex_cafe_10_55,We're not making excuses!
d_ex_cafe_10_56,Can you prove it?
d_ex_cafe_10_57,"If you're gonna accuse me of doing something shady with him, then you'd better prove it, smartass!"
d_ex_cafe_10_58,... Proof? Ugh. Too lazy.
d_ex_cafe_10_59,Believe you for now.
d_ex_cafe_10_60,"... Fine, I'll move onto the next question."
d_ex_cafe_10_61,"I swear, I'm gonna tear this place apart..."
d_ex_cafe_10_62,"All right, last question."
d_ex_cafe_10_63,You... really gonna be our daughter?
d_ex_cafe_10_64,!!!
d_ex_cafe_10_65,Wh-wh-what are you... talking about...?
d_ex_cafe_10_66,Don't tell me you don't know your words are all over the Outpost?
d_ex_cafe_10_67,What was it again...? Something about how wearing embarrassing clothes would make you look like Sugar and Frima's kid?
d_ex_cafe_10_68,Rumor. Heard it too.
d_ex_cafe_10_69,This. Real?
d_ex_cafe_10_70,... I did hear something along those lines too.
d_ex_cafe_10_71,Uh...
d_ex_cafe_10_72,"This time, we even have a witness."
d_ex_cafe_10_73,So if that's the case...
d_ex_cafe_10_74,"go on, call me Mom."
d_ex_cafe_10_75,Not a chance!
d_ex_cafe_10_76,... Disappointed.
d_ex_cafe_10_77,"Trust is a Scavenger's lifeline, yet you can't even honor your word?"
d_ex_cafe_10_78,Cafe Sweety's reputation will hit the dirt.
d_ex_cafe_10_79,"Ugh, what nonsense is this?!"
d_ex_cafe_10_80,Then what? Gonna make some excuse?
d_ex_cafe_10_81,!!
d_ex_cafe_10_82,Realized.
d_ex_cafe_10_83,Milk. Outfit. Not embarrassed.
d_ex_cafe_10_84,Y-yeah! That's right!
d_ex_cafe_10_85,"I'm only wearing this for the mission, so there's no way I'd be embarrassed!"
d_ex_cafe_10_86,"Since I'm not embarrassed, I don't have to go acting like your kid either!"
d_ex_cafe_10_87,... Got it.
d_ex_cafe_10_88,"Milk, I know where you stand."
d_ex_cafe_10_89,Since you've put it that way...
d_ex_cafe_10_90,you'll be taking on missions in that outfit from now on.
d_ex_cafe_10_91,Wha...?!
d_ex_cafe_10_92,Oh...
d_ex_cafe_10_93,"Hold on, why did things turn out like this?"
d_ex_cafe_10_94,"You said you weren't embarrassed, so that much should be fine."
d_ex_cafe_10_95,"Or... were you just lying to get out of trouble, and you're actually embarrassed?"
d_ex_cafe_10_96,Daughter. Here.
d_ex_cafe_10_97,"... All right, fine. If it means that much to you, I'll do it."
d_ex_cafe_10_98,"From now on, I'll take on missions in this outfit."
d_ex_cafe_10_99,"Happy now, you punks?"
d_ex_cafe_10_100,"No, I don't think you have to go that far..."
d_ex_cafe_10_101,"Not another word, Pal."
d_ex_cafe_10_102,This is about my honor as a Scavenger.
d_ex_cafe_10_103,I need to prove that I'm not embarrassed in the slightest.
d_ex_cafe_10_104,"So I'm gonna work in this outfit for the next seven days, starting now."
d_ex_cafe_10_105,That's too bad... I thought I'd get to hear you call me Mom.
d_ex_cafe_10_106,Same.
d_ex_cafe_10_107,In your dreams!
d_ex_cafe_10_108,"For an entire week,"
d_ex_cafe_10_109,a strange rumor circulates through the Outpost: a Scavenger in a bunny girl outfit is carrying out missions.
