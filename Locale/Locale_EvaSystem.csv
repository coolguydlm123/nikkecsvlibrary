YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_01,"As we approached the combat area, we noticed a zero-gravity phenomenon occurring around us.

There were fragments we've never seen before all around us, and these crimson substances left us short of breath."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_02,"The crimson substances stuck to some of our comrades upon contact.
Their physical abilities showed anomalies, and our communications were cut off.
All we could do was hope the reinforcement squad would locate us through the messages we left."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_03,"This area is filled with cross-shaped lights.
I witnessed the crimson giants emerging from the ground.
What in the world is happening?
Thankfully, the reinforcement squad found us, and we managed to survive."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_04,"As we retreated, I saw three giants fighting over the sea.
Could those be Raptures? Or are they new life forms?
The sky was suddenly painted crimson, and so did the sea and the land.
We watched as twisted rays of light transform into giants...
Fortunately, this nightmare ended not long after."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_05,"As the crimson giants walked through the wreckage, their heads fell off.
Beneath the helmet-like part, there was flesh underneath.
I remember now. Humans contorted into those giants in the light.
Ah... The world is becoming increasingly strange..."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_06,"This is Eunhwa. There are too many Raptures here. It's difficult to break through.
...The special combat team has arrived at the sea?
Roger. Absolute will now provide rear support."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_07,"This is Eunhwa. We found a transport squad that was unable to advance due to the Raptures.
We've confirmed that the AZX, the squad members, and the resources are all in good condition.
We will deal with the Raptures. It'll be quick."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_08,"This is Eunhwa. The AZX has returned safely.
We'll stay here to provide rear support."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_09,"This is Eunhwa. The communications were cut off earlier.
A giant Rapture's signal? Are you sure?
... No, leave it to us.
The special combat team has its own mission."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_10,"This is Eunhwa. All Raptures on the route have retreated. What's the situation at the sea?
So you were successful. That explains the clamor.
Roger. We will recondition ourselves after returning.
I've compiled all the reports for this mission."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_11,"We couldn't fish along the way because of the Admire's speed.
What? Anchor almost got poked by a spearfish?
Gosh, this isn't the time to be fishing!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_12,"Since Helm is injured, I shall take on the great mission of conquering the sea!
By the way, I think Raptures nearby are affected by the D-Wave. They look kinda strange."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_13,"They seem to be wary of the sea area with restored sealing columns.
Let's continue to observe and... What?!
The sealing columns are under attack? I'm heading there right now!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_14,"Although I, Captain Mast, gained many things from the sea, I won't be attached to profits.
I'll give all of these treasures to my friends!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_15,"What a thrilling and unforgettable experience.
This is a monumental adventure worthy of being recorded in the history of Pirate Mast's merits!
Listen up! From now on, refer to me as the legendary pirate and—mmph, mmph!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_16,"Heroic dispatch! On the way to rescue!
... What? Absolute has already taken care of it?"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_17,"Heroic dispatch! Charging to the beach!
The path is getting redder!
Communications have been cut off!
Hero is in crisis!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_18,"Heroes from another world have appeared!
We can now return!
But the fact that we as heroes need to be rescued...
is an utter disgrace!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_19,"Heroic dispatch!
Setting off with high-performance navigation alongside heroes from another world!
Heroic escort!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_20,"Enhanced Raptures keep appearing at the beach because of the D-Wave!
They're called E-Raptures!
Well then, we're the E-Heroes! Because the heroes from another world gave us the D-Wave!
E-Heroic dispatch!"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_21,"It's been 5 hours since I was sucked into the mysterious tunnel.
I have no way to contact the Ark.
Where has everyone gone? And where is this place?
It's beautiful here, though.
Is this really... the surface?
It's peaceful, but so lonely."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_22,"It's this unfamiliar ceiling again.
I entered that twisted cave to escape, and then lost consciousness.
Is it truly impossible for me to leave this place?
I feel like I've forgotten something, but I find comfort in that.
Because I no longer have to fight with all my might. Still, I feel empty."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_23,"I decided to venture deeper.
The deeper I went, the more desolate this world became.
When I walked closer, there was a massive sphere covered in blood.
Countless fragments of red giants scattered around, and a few of them even moved sometimes.
My heart felt at peace as I stayed in the safe zone. Everything in this world obeyed my thoughts.
But for some reason, I suddenly wanted to go back."
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_24,"There was a soundstage in the depths of the faded world.
As someone who enjoys variety shows, I recognized it at a single glance.
There, I encountered a beautiful girl.
She seemed sad and told me the way to get out.
She wished me luck. But... why did she ask me my reason for leaving?"
YX002_PIECE_UNLOCKED_DESC_25,"The train arrived at the station, and people boarded it excitingly.
I think I saw that girl again. She was smiling brightly.
I sat on the platform, waiting for someone, though I didn't know who.
Then, I saw them—people hugging each other tightly with happy faces.
Yes, it's time for me to board as well. I should go back.
Back to the person who'll embrace me closely."
