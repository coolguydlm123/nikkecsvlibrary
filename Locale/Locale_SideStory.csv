s001_01_title,Second Affection: 1
s001_01_1,Huff... Huff...
s001_01_2,...
s001_01_3,...
s001_01_4,Huff...! Huff...!
s001_01_5,"Hey, Snow White. Are you okay?"
s001_01_6,Oh... Huff... I'm okay.
s001_01_7,You certainly don't look it.
s001_01_8,Appearances can be deceiving.
s001_01_9,What drivel dost thee spew?
s001_01_10,Shall we switch? Snow White has had to carry Marian this whole time.
s001_01_11,Thine armor is also most prodigious.
s001_01_12,I am sure 'tis a most formidable weight to bear.
s001_01_13,"It's no picnic, that's for sure."
s001_01_14,Let's switch then.
s001_01_15,...
s001_01_16,As I live and breathe! She is sound asleep.
s001_01_17,Passed out is more like it.
s001_01_18,"Take a break, Snow White."
s001_01_19,...
s001_01_20,Do not blame thineself.
s001_01_21,You had nothing to do with her ending up this way.
s001_01_22,It's my fault.
s001_01_23,"Very well, let's say it is."
s001_01_24,"Be that as it may, we will share your burden."
s001_01_25,Both emotional and physical.
s001_01_26,...
s001_01_27,Is it so difficult to comprehend?
s001_01_28,Are we not comrades?
s001_01_29,"Come on, let me carry her."
s001_01_30,"It may not seem like it, but I'm quite adept at carrying things."
s001_01_31,When did thou develop such prowess?
s001_01_32,"Ah, I see. Thine skills must have blossomed whilst helping the others recuperate."
s001_01_33,"That too, but I've also hauled my fair share of deer..."
s001_01_34,A deer?
s001_01_35,Never mind.
s001_01_36,"Forget I said anything. Come on, hand her over to me."
s001_01_37,... Very well. Be gentle with her.
s001_01_38,"Snow White carefully hands over Marian, whom she had been carrying, to Rapunzel."
s001_01_39,"Let's see... gather the arms, then lift onto the shoulders like so..."
s001_01_40,Hrngh!
s001_01_41,!!
s001_01_42,Impressive.
s001_01_43,Haha. I told you so.
s001_01_44,"Let's get a move on, shall we?"
s001_01_45,Rapunzel starts to walk off.
s001_01_46,*Drag drag*
s001_01_47,Marian's feet drag on the ground.
s001_01_48,Her feet are being subjected to the most unusual punishment.
s001_01_49,"So long as it doesn't slow down the pace, it should be fine."
s001_01_50,... This is true.
s001_02_title,Second Affection: 2
s001_02_1,Mmm...
s001_02_2,Are you awake?
s001_02_3,Wha... where am I?
s001_02_4,!!
s001_02_5,Le-let go of me!!
s001_02_6,Marian squirms frantically and Rapunzel staggers as she attempts to restrain her.
s001_02_7,"Okay, okay! I'm putting you down, just relax."
s001_02_8,Ahhh! Let me go!
s001_02_9,"Chill out, will you? If you keep flopping around, you'll end up touching me...!"
s001_02_10,I said let go!
s001_02_11,"Oh, YES!"
s001_02_12,*Thud*
s001_02_13,Rapunzel collapses to the ground in a heap.
s001_02_14,"Hmph, hmph!"
s001_02_15,Where is the Commander? I want to see the Commander!
s001_02_16,You can't do that.
s001_02_17,"I'm going to see him, and that's final!"
s001_02_18,You can't.
s001_02_19,Commander! Commander! Where are you?!
s001_02_20,Rapi! Anis! Neon!
s001_02_21,Where are you?
s001_02_22,Anybody?
s001_02_23,Has everyone abandoned me...?
s001_02_24,This isn't real...
s001_02_25,Commander!
s001_02_26,I told you. He's not here.
s001_02_27,We're the only ones here.
s001_02_28,That... that's impossible.
s001_02_29,I want to go back. I want to see the Commander.
s001_02_30,I-is it this way...?
s001_02_31,No.
s001_02_32,I-I knew that! I was going to head in the opposite direction!
s001_02_33,"If you go back now, they'll have you dissected on an operating table within an hour."
s001_02_34,I can defend myself!
s001_02_35,I'm sure you can.
s001_02_36,But you wouldn't be the only one in danger. They would kill your precious Commander.
s001_02_37,...!
s001_02_38,He will do whatever it takes to protect you.
s001_02_39,"And as punishment for turning his back on the entire Ark,"
s001_02_40,they'll kill him.
s001_02_41,...
s001_02_42,"The situation truly is most unjust. A bitter pill to swallow, forsooth."
s001_02_43,"But what of the feelings of My Lord, who sent you to us?"
s001_02_44,"He has put you in our care, because he himself is powerless."
s001_02_45,Try to understand. Now is not the time to fuss.
s001_02_46,What he needs right now is time. Time to become stronger.
s001_02_47,So you must be patient.
s001_02_48,...
s001_02_49,What if he doesn't come back for me?
s001_02_50,Do you really take him for the mendacious type?
s001_02_51,No. The Commander would never lie to me.
s001_02_52,There you have it. Hence why we're asking you to wait a little longer.
s001_02_53,"He will come back for you, and until then, we will protect you. I promise."
s001_02_54,...
s001_02_55,...
s001_02_56,Keep walking.
s001_02_57,The road is long.
s001_03_title,Second Affection: 3
s001_03_1,She seems to have calmed down.
s001_03_2,"Praise the heavens. Had she continued to be so obstreperous, our journey would have been most trying."
s001_03_3,"Should she utilize her strength fully, it would be impossible for us to stop her."
s001_03_4,"If they had taught her the way of the sword, she would have been legendary."
s001_03_5,Are you tempted?
s001_03_6,"If I said no, it would be a lie. I've never seen someone with such physical prowess."
s001_03_7,We all know how interested you are in... physical strength.
s001_03_8,...
s001_03_9,"Oh, to be a mentor watching all the physical developments of their disciples' physiques..."
s001_03_10,"Perhaps teaching the pleasures of the flesh to the most learned disciples... yes, YES!"
s001_03_11,...
s001_03_12,Um...
s001_03_13,Where are we going?
s001_03_14,A safe place.
s001_03_15,What do you mean?
s001_03_16,Exactly what I said.
s001_03_17,Nowhere is safe up on the surface.
s001_03_18,So where are we going?
s001_03_19,...
s001_03_20,It's a place Raptures have no interest in.
s001_03_21,"That's where you'll be living,"
s001_03_22,until your prince charming comes back for you.
s001_03_23,...
s001_03_24,I see.
s001_03_25,How far do we have to go?
s001_03_26,"At our current speed, it will take about a week on foot."
s001_03_27,What?! A week?
s001_03_28,5 whole days?
s001_03_29,... A week is 7 days.
s001_03_30,"Oh, right. I knew that. I was just testing you."
s001_03_31,... I assure you that I'm well aware of how many days are in a week. You don't have to test me.
s001_03_32,What's waiting for us over there?
s001_03_33,You'll find out when you get there.
s001_03_34,...
s001_03_35,Keep walking.
s001_03_36,... All right.
s001_03_37,She really is pushing her hard.
s001_03_38,You're right.
s001_04_title,Second Affection: 4
s001_04_1,"Um, excuse me."
s001_04_2,...
s001_04_3,Hey!
s001_04_4,It's Snow White.
s001_04_5,Wha... is that your real name?
s001_04_6,Isn't that what you were about to ask me?
s001_04_7,"No... it's just that the sun is down, and..."
s001_04_8,Yes. Night has fallen.
s001_04_9,??
s001_04_10,??
s001_04_11,I was told I should sleep at night.
s001_04_12,By who?
s001_04_13,The Commander.
s001_04_14,That's because he's human.
s001_04_15,Something which we are not.
s001_04_16,Foregoing sleep will not pose a problem for us.
s001_04_17,So we just keep walking?
s001_04_18,Yes.
s001_04_19,"If we sleep, it will take twice as long, and as you're well aware, the surface is far from accommodating."
s001_04_20,We keep moving.
s001_04_21,...
s001_04_22,All right.
s001_04_23,"Snow White, we should rest a bit."
s001_04_24,I agree.
s001_04_25,"No. Unless we have no other choice, we should avoid camping outside altogether."
s001_04_26,Now would be a good time for us to rest.
s001_04_27,And what made you come to that conclusion?
s001_04_28,Marian is really struggling.
s001_04_29,It's all in her head. Nikkes do not experience fatigue.
s001_04_30,You know as well as I do that's not true.
s001_04_31,...
s001_04_32,We have to maintain a steady pace the entire way through.
s001_04_33,"If one of us increases the pace too much, it'll be too much for the others."
s001_04_34,*Gasp*
s001_04_35,If one side increases the pace... it'd be too much to handle...
s001_04_36,She would beg you to stop... she'd cry that she couldn't take it anymore...
s001_04_37,Oh yes... right there... that's it...
s001_04_38,...
s001_04_39,There's a stream nearby. We should rest here.
s001_04_40,...
s001_04_41,You mustn't underestimate the value of a good rest.
s001_04_42,"For hardy folks like us who wander the surface, we can disregard our physical conditions."
s001_04_43,But such a thing could be dangerous for normal Nikkes.
s001_04_44,The strain could result in a Mind Switch. You of all people should know that.
s001_04_45,Marian only came up from the Ark today.
s001_04_46,... Very well. I didn't take everything into consideration.
s001_04_47,Let's take a break.
s001_04_48,"Are you okay, Marian?"
s001_04_49,... Not really...
s001_04_50,"Let's stay here and rest for a bit, okay?"
s001_04_51,Okay...
s001_04_52,Hang in there.
s001_04_53,...
s001_05_title,Second Affection: 5
s001_05_1,"Um... none of you happen to have a blanket, do you?"
s001_05_2,"We're camping outdoors. Sorry to break it to you, but the bare ground will have to suffice."
s001_05_3,...
s001_05_4,Just a moment. I'll try to find something for you to lie on.
s001_05_5,"No, it's okay."
s001_05_6,I can manage.
s001_05_7,...
s001_05_8,Are you hungry?
s001_05_9,I am.
s001_05_10,"I didn't ask you. Besides, you're always hungry."
s001_05_11,"Are you hungry, Marian?"
s001_05_12,I'm okay.
s001_05_13,*Gurgle*
s001_05_14,...
s001_05_15,Your body is telling us otherwise.
s001_05_16,I'll chance a visit to that stream close by.
s001_05_17,"If I'm lucky, I could catch a few freshwater fish."
s001_05_18,!!
s001_05_19,What's a fish?
s001_05_20,Would you like to see?
s001_05_21,Yes.
s001_05_22,Then follow me.
s001_05_23,You can keep me company.
s001_05_24,Nearby stream.
s001_05_25,"Hmm, these are proving tougher to catch than I anticipated."
s001_05_26,"What are you doing, exactly?"
s001_05_27,This is a tool called a fishing rod used to catch fish in the water.
s001_05_28,Don't be silly. Fish come from the refrigerator.
s001_05_29,Er... there are various types of fish in the world.
s001_05_30,...
s001_05_31,Do they taste good?
s001_05_32,"Their flavor is on a whole different plane, far exceeding whatever you have had in the Ark."
s001_05_33,So when will the fish come out?
s001_05_34,"Patience, my friend. Nothing gets accomplished by rushing."
s001_05_35,...
s001_05_36,...
s001_05_37,Hey.
s001_05_38,Don't look so sad.
s001_05_39,... But I am sad.
s001_05_40,"That is how the world works. As there are happy things, so there are sad things."
s001_05_41,How can life be full of only good things?
s001_05_42,How were things when you were with your Commander?
s001_05_43,It was nice.
s001_05_44,"So those were happy days,"
s001_05_45,and today is a sad day.
s001_05_46,That's all there is to it.
s001_05_47,When will the good times come back?
s001_05_48,That is up to you.
s001_05_49,Let me impart upon thee the secret to living life.
s001_05_50,Think only of the good things. Then the good times will last longer and the melancholy will quickly fade.
s001_05_51,"Should thou commence thinking only of good things now, and set your heart to creating good things,"
s001_05_52,the sadness of today will be washed away like tears in the rain.
s001_05_53,So I should think of only the Commander?
s001_05_54,That would be one way of doing it.
s001_05_55,Think about the day you will be reunited.
s001_05_56,Isn't it pretty to think so?
s001_05_57,"... Yes, it is."
s001_05_58,Think about that then.
s001_05_59,"Let those thoughts fill you with resolve and the will to live, and things will be different."
s001_05_60,Um... what should I call you?
s001_05_61,My name is Scarlet.
s001_05_62,Scarlet... what are the good things that you think about?
s001_05_63,Me?
s001_05_64,I think of cutting the Queen's throat.
s001_05_65,I think about the beauty of nature.
s001_05_66,What makes that so good?
s001_05_67,How wonderful it would feel to slash the throat of the one responsible for making the world what it has become.
s001_05_68,Gazing at its majesty provides a pleasure that never diminishes.
s001_05_69,Hmm... I don't think I quite understand.
s001_05_70,"You don't have to. If you knew everything, what fun life would be... Ah!"
s001_05_71,*Splash*
s001_05_72,"There is a small burst of activity in the stream, and Scarlet's fishing rod bends."
s001_05_73,Attached to the end of the fishing line is a fish the length of her forearm.
s001_05_74,This is a big one!
s001_05_75,Whoa! What is that thing?!
s001_05_76,*Flap flap flap*
s001_05_77,It's still moving!
s001_05_78,This is what they call a fish. How does it feel to see one in person?
s001_05_79,It looks kinda funny.
s001_05_80,"... Well, thou are nothing if not brutally honest."
s001_05_81,Is this what we're going to eat?
s001_05_82,"That's right. We can't eat it straight away, though. We'll have to cook it first."
s001_05_83,Whoa!
s001_05_84,...
s001_05_85,I also...
s001_05_86,... N-never mind.
s001_05_87,Come here and sit.
s001_05_88,"It might be hard since it's your first time,"
s001_05_89,but try catching one yourself.
s001_05_90,Okay!
s001_06_title,Second Affection: 6
s001_06_1,Scarlet and Marian come back with their arms full of fish.
s001_06_2,!!
s001_06_3,"Wow, those are some real whoppers. How did you manage to catch so many?"
s001_06_4,Am I dreaming?
s001_06_5,Marian caught the lion's share of them.
s001_06_6,She's a natural.
s001_06_7,Hehe.
s001_06_8,Should we light a small fire? Nothing so big as to draw attention to ourselves.
s001_06_9,"Scarlet can clean the fish, and I'll handle the cooking."
s001_06_10,"As for me, I'll get ready to eat."
s001_06_11,Could you at least go wash your face first? You've got drool dripping down your chin.
s001_06_12,I don't mind.
s001_06_13,"Why don't you set up the jammer, then?"
s001_06_14,"Rapunzel pulls out a neatly tied bundle of her hair, which she had previously removed."
s001_06_15,On it.
s001_06_16,...
s001_06_17,"You're not going to eat without me, are you?"
s001_06_18,"We won't take a bite until you're back, so don't worry."
s001_06_19,"All right, I'm choosing to trust you."
s001_06_20,Snow White walks away.
s001_06_21,Er...
s001_06_22,"Marian, you can lie down over there and rest."
s001_06_23,Rapunzel gestures at some old blankets which have been spread out.
s001_06_24,Are those blankets? Where did you get those?
s001_06_25,Turns out there was a village close by.
s001_06_26,"They may not measure up to what you'd find in the Ark, but they'll be better than nothing."
s001_06_27,...
s001_06_28,Go ahead.
s001_06_29,Marian awkwardly plops down on the old blankets.
s001_06_30,"Rapunzel quickly sets to collecting some kindling, then ignites a bunch of dry grass with a fire starter."
s001_06_31,"The spark catches, and before long, the surroundings are illuminated by the dancing flames."
s001_06_32,"Scarlet quickly guts and scales the fish, then hands them to Rapunzel,"
s001_06_33,who skewers them on an iron rod she found lying nearby.
s001_06_34,Rapunzel then places the impaled fish near the fire.
s001_06_35,Our speed hath improved verily.
s001_06_36,Hehe. I'm glad we're at least getting better at something. It's a pity there's no salt.
s001_06_37,"How are you holding up, Marian? Are you comfortable?"
s001_06_38,I... I'm fine.
s001_06_39,"This will take some time to cook, so you can sleep for a bit."
s001_06_40,I'll wake you up when it's done.
s001_06_41,...
s001_06_42,Get some rest. We'll protect you.
s001_06_43,"As soon as Rapunzel finishes speaking, Marian feels her eyelids getting heavy."
s001_06_44,"The soft blankets, the crackling of the fire, the flickering flames..."
s001_06_45,Marian quickly falls asleep without even realizing.
s001_06_46,Zzz...
s001_06_47,That was fast.
s001_06_48,... How hard it must have been for her.
s001_06_49,Fate has not been kind to her.
s001_06_50,It will only get worse going forward.
s001_06_51,A Heretic coming back to humanity's side.
s001_06_52,Just saying it out loud seems outrageous.
s001_06_53,She has a difficult life ahead of her.
s001_06_54,What can we do for her?
s001_06_55,We must teach her how to press on.
s001_06_56,"How to endure, even when you're alone."
s001_06_57,We have two weeks.
s001_06_58,We have to teach her everything we can during that time.
s001_06_59,Dost thou believe there will be a time when she is alone?
s001_06_60,...
s001_06_61,It is a certainty.
s001_06_62,"And when that time comes,"
s001_06_63,we cannot be sure which side she will choose to stand on.
s001_06_64,"As long as Believer is present, things will not fall apart entirely, but..."
s001_06_65,there are always uncertainties.
s001_06_66,That is what I believe as well.
s001_06_67,How do you think Snow White will feel?
s001_06_68,Snow White has already started.
s001_06_69,She's teaching her in her own way.
s001_06_70,You don't need to worry about that.
s001_06_71,Very well.
s001_06_72,"You haven't eaten yet, have you?"
s001_06_73,Ssshhh.
s001_06_74,...
s001_06_75,Have you eaten?
s001_06_76,"No, we haven't. It still needs to cook some more."
s001_06_77,I'm sure we could eat it now and be fine.
s001_06_78,That's not the point. It simply wouldn't taste good.
s001_06_79,"Again, I don't see the problem."
s001_06_80,Just hold your horses.
s001_06_81,... Fine.
s001_07_title,Second Affection: 7
s001_07_1,Whoa! I've never tasted something like this before.
s001_07_2,Dost thou enjoy it?
s001_07_3,Very much!
s001_07_4,Then have mine.
s001_07_5,Really?
s001_07_6,Certainly. Take it.
s001_07_7,You can have mine as well.
s001_07_8,"Okay, thanks!"
s001_07_9,...
s001_07_10,"What is it, Snow White? Something wrong?"
s001_07_11,... Do I have to give her mine too?
s001_07_12,"Well... we already gave her ours, so you can keep yours to yourself."
s001_07_13,"Forsooth, Marian's appetite truly is most prodigious!"
s001_07_14,"Then again, this is her first time eating proper food from up on the surface. 'Tis most sensible."
s001_07_15,*Chomp chomp chomp*
s001_07_16,Oh my gosh! This is really delicious!
s001_07_17,...
s001_07_18,Take it.
s001_07_19,Snow White gives the fish she was holding to Marian.
s001_07_20,!!
s001_07_21,!!
s001_07_22,Can I eat this too?
s001_07_23,Yes.
s001_07_24,"Thanks, hehe!"
s001_07_25,Snow White...
s001_07_26,"You're not experiencing a Mind Switch or anything like that, are you?"
s001_07_27,No.
s001_07_28,...
s001_07_29,*Chomp chomp chomp*
s001_07_30,Is it good?
s001_07_31,Really good!
s001_07_32,"You're not going to eat the bones, are you?"
s001_07_33,Are the bones this hard stuff? I don't think I should eat that.
s001_07_34,Good.
s001_07_35,??
s001_07_36,"You could have had at least one, Snow White."
s001_07_37,It's okay.
s001_07_38,Hehe.
s001_07_39,"After a few moments,"
s001_07_40,the sumptuous fireside banquet has been consumed in its entirety.
s001_07_41,"Marian lies down on the ground, sleeping."
s001_07_42,Why don't we let Marian stay with us?
s001_07_43,We are always in danger. And we don't usually move in a group like this.
s001_07_44,Today was a special case.
s001_07_45,"I know, but we can take turns accompanying her."
s001_07_46,No.
s001_07_47,Marian needs a place to stay.
s001_07_48,"She hasn't fully recovered mentally, and she needs something tangible to hold onto."
s001_07_49,"Having a single, fixed location is the best option for that."
s001_07_50,"The Ark can no longer serve that function for her. She was driven away, and there is no guarantee that she'll ever be able to go back."
s001_07_51,"Of course, Eden is also an option."
s001_07_52,"That's not a viable option, either."
s001_07_53,Dorothy is there.
s001_07_54,...
s001_07_55,... I understand.
s001_07_56,You just want to take on a disciple.
s001_07_57,!!
s001_07_58,I... I can't deny that.
s001_07_59,It's still early. We have things to do.
s001_07_60,I know. I know very well.
s001_07_61,I got a bit greedy. Forgive me.
s001_08_title,Second Affection: 8
s001_08_1,"It's best to avoid places like this, where the mud is thick. It could be a swamp."
s001_08_2,"Were someone of our mass to fall into a swamp, it would be all over."
s001_08_3,What's a swamp?
s001_08_4,Think of it as a pit you can never get out of.
s001_08_5,Can't you just jump out of it?
s001_08_6,Imagine multiple hands holding you back so that you can't jump.
s001_08_7,What would hands be doing in a pit?
s001_08_8,"I do not speak of real, literal hands..."
s001_08_9,Hmm...
s001_08_10,Are you sure there are hands in there? How do they move?
s001_08_11,...
s001_08_12,There are many useful items in abandoned places like this.
s001_08_13,"Blankets, firewood, stuff like that."
s001_08_14,Isn't that stealing?
s001_08_15,"No, since they don't have an owner."
s001_08_16,But they might come back.
s001_08_17,"... That won't happen, Marian."
s001_08_18,How do you know?
s001_08_19,Let me put it this way: if they're covered in dust or cobwebs...
s001_08_20,You must kill a Rapture the moment you lay eyes on it.
s001_08_21,Why do we have to kill it?
s001_08_22,"If you don't, it will kill you."
s001_08_23,Why would it kill us?
s001_08_24,Because Raptures are bad guys.
s001_08_25,Why are Raptures bad?
s001_08_26,They just are.
s001_08_27,Why?
s001_08_28,"There is no ""why"". They just are."
s001_08_29,"When venturing off into the unknown, one's state of mind is paramount."
s001_08_30,"If you control your mind, there is nothing to fear in this world."
s001_08_31,How do you control your mind?
s001_08_32,I drink alcohol.
s001_08_33,Huh?
s001_08_34,"If you drink alcohol, everything in the world becomes perfectly peaceful."
s001_08_35,Sounds nice! I'd like a drink.
s001_08_36,"Oh, really?"
s001_08_37,"Hey, wait a minute..."
s001_08_38,"When you explore a village, you might find things like books."
s001_08_39,"They're big and heavy, and not easy to carry around, but..."
s001_08_40,"If you take the time to read them, the way you look at the world might change."
s001_08_41,What is this book?
s001_08_42,!!
s001_08_43,Blinding Passion... Volume 1?
s001_08_44,What's a masterpiece doing in a place like this?
s001_08_45,Will my perspective on the world change if I read this?
s001_08_46,"You bet it will! This won't just give you a new perspective, it'll open up a whole new world for you!"
s001_08_47,Wow! Can I read it?
s001_08_48,Do you really want to?
s001_08_49,"O-okay, let me show you..."
s001_08_50,Remember this:
s001_08_51,Eat when you can.
s001_08_52,Don't be picky. Eat whatever you can find.
s001_08_53,How do I distinguish what I can eat?
s001_08_54,It's simple.
s001_08_55,Just try eating it.
s001_08_56,Is this something I can eat?
s001_08_57,Marian points at a nearby rock.
s001_08_58,!!
s001_08_59,I've never tried it.
s001_08_60,Should we?
s001_08_61,"Sure, let's give it a shot."
s001_08_62,It's good to be adventurous and try new things.
s001_08_63,Okay!
s001_08_64,... Please don't do that.
s001_08_65,Scarlet.
s001_08_66,Yes?
s001_08_67,Can I have more alcohol?
s001_08_68,...
s001_08_69,You seem to be drinking a lot lately...
s001_08_70,"My mind's too loud. I want it to be quiet. Give me some more, please?"
s001_08_71,"... Fine, one more glass."
s001_08_72,*Pour*
s001_08_73,*Gulp gulp*
s001_08_74,Ahh...lovely.
s001_08_75,Snow White.
s001_08_76,What is it?
s001_08_77,"I tried making rice balls with sawdust and centipedes earlier,"
s001_08_78,and I have to say... I think they're my masterpiece.
s001_08_79,!!
s001_08_80,"I put some in your backpack, so you can have some whenever you're hungry."
s001_08_81,Um... thank you.
s001_08_82,Rapunzel.
s001_08_83,Yes?
s001_08_84,Don't you think the fire
s001_08_85,looks a bit like a man playing with his...
s001_08_86,... Oh my!
s001_08_87,Y-you're right! It absolutely does.
s001_08_88,Why didn't I think of that?
s001_08_89,...
s001_08_90,I have a feeling things are not going the way I thought...
s001_08_91,Bring me some alcohol!
s001_08_92,"Rapunzel, hold her!"
s001_08_93,Got it!
s001_08_94,Urgh!
s001_08_95,*Pinch*
s001_08_96,Aaaaahhh! ♡
s001_08_97,H-how did you do that in one shot? Y-you're amazing...!
s001_08_98,The thoroughly satisfied Rapunzel slumps to the ground.
s001_08_99,I want booze!
s001_08_100,Marian. Sit down.
s001_08_101,No! I refuse!
s001_08_102,...
s001_08_103,Why are you wearing your underwear on the outside again?
s001_08_104,Who cares?
s001_08_105,You're supposed to wear your underwear under your clothing.
s001_08_106,"It doesn't affect my movement, so what does it matter?"
s001_08_107,...
s001_08_108,"Come to think of it, you're right. I can't refute that."
s001_08_109,"For goodness sake, try and think of something..."
s001_08_110,"Oooh, look. A bullet."
s001_08_111,Are bullets edible?
s001_08_112,I'll know once I give it a try.
s001_08_113,*Crack*
s001_08_114,Hmm...
s001_08_115,Guess not.
s001_08_116,Firepower! Firepower!
s001_08_117,Hehe!
s001_08_118,Hmm...
s001_08_119,Zzz...
s001_08_120,...
s001_08_121,...
s001_08_122,I can't believe...
s001_08_123,What kind of monster have we created?
s001_09_title,Second Affection: 9
s001_09_1,The next day.
s001_09_2,Ughhh... My head hurts...
s001_09_3,My stomach doesn't feel so good either.
s001_09_4,"Commander, I'm sick..."
s001_09_5,She hasn't sobered up just yet.
s001_09_6,Urggh...
s001_09_7,"Frankly, it's amazing that she's even mobile."
s001_09_8,The four Nikkes all plod along without a word.
s001_09_9,After about an hour...
s001_09_10,Rapture detected.
s001_09_11,"A rather formidable one, at that."
s001_09_12,Which formation should we use?
s001_09_13,I'll go first.
s001_09_14,Snow White runs off.
s001_09_15,"Pray tell, why is she in such a hurry?"
s001_09_16,We should go too.
s001_09_17,Let's.
s001_09_b1_1,My orders are simple: Kill every last Rapture you see.
s001_09_b1_2,"Seven Dwarves, ready."
s001_09_b1_3,Encounter.
s001_09_b2_1,"Thou rushed in most impetuously, but you seem to be having a hard time."
s001_09_b2_2,No. I'll show them.
s001_09_b2_3,"You say that, but it looks to me that you've sustained some bodily injuries."
s001_09_b2_4,Can't you fix it?
s001_09_b2_5,Of course.
s001_09_b2_6,"Rapunzel, back us up."
s001_09_b2_7,"Snow White, come with me."
s001_09_b2_8,Let's go.
s001_09_b3_1,We're nearly there.
s001_09_b3_2,Time to finish this.
s001_09_b3_3,Stay frosty out there.
s001_09_b3_4,Of course.
s001_09_b3_e_1,Clear.
s001_09_b3_e_2,That was quite the challenge.
s001_09_b3_e_3,"It has been quite some time since we encountered them, and then they came out of nowhere."
s001_09_b3_e_4,Do you think there's a reason for that?
s001_09_b3_e_5,...
s001_09_b3_e_6,Ughhh...
s001_09_b3_e_7,I don't know.
s001_09_b3_e_8,"The Nikkes resume walking,"
s001_09_b3_e_9,and another hour later...
s001_09_b3_e_10,"Snow White, Scarlet, and Rapunzel all stop in unison, as if on cue."
s001_09_b3_e_11,"This is where you come in, Snow White."
s001_09_b3_e_12,We'll leave it to you.
s001_09_b3_e_13,All right.
s001_09_b3_e_14,"Marian, Scarlet, and I are going to head our own way from here."
s001_09_b3_e_15,Urgh...
s001_09_b3_e_16,Thou dost resemble a member of the walking dead...
s001_09_b3_e_17,"Are you okay with this, Snow White?"
s001_09_b3_e_18,I'm fine with it.
s001_09_b3_e_19,Shouldn't we all stick together?
s001_09_b3_e_20,"When Marian comes to her senses, she is likely to throw a fit."
s001_09_b3_e_21,No.
s001_09_b3_e_22,We have things to do. It's not efficient for all of us to move together.
s001_09_b3_e_23,We all have our own tasks to take care of at this point.
s001_09_b3_e_24,"Furthermore,"
s001_09_b3_e_25,it wouldn't be smart for all of us to know where Marian will be hiding.
s001_09_b3_e_26,Yes. It would be dangerous if our brains were scanned.
s001_09_b3_e_27,I have a rough idea of where she'll be going though.
s001_09_b3_e_28,"Okay, I'll leave the rest in your capable hands, Snow White."
s001_09_b3_e_29,Yeah.
s001_09_b3_e_30,Rapunzel approaches Marian.
s001_09_b3_e_31,"See you around, Marian."
s001_09_b3_e_32,"Ugh... my head hurts... Carry me, Commander..."
s001_09_b3_e_33,...
s001_09_b3_e_34,Let's go.
s001_09_b3_e_35,All right.
s001_09_b3_e_36,Scarlet and Rapunzel both head off in opposite directions.
s001_09_b3_e_37,"Snow White gazes at them for a while, then takes Marian's hand and begins to walk."
s001_09_b3_e_38,"After three hours or so have passed,"
s001_09_b3_e_39,a towering fortress stands before them.
s001_09_b3_e_40,You morons!
s001_09_b3_e_41,You said you would be here in a week! It's been two whole weeks!
s001_09_b3_e_42,I had to throw away all the food I made. I've been keeping watch constantly to see when you were coming!
s001_09_b3_e_43,Now you show up all of a sudden without telling me? What do you expect me to do?
s001_09_b3_e_44,Something came up.
s001_09_b3_e_45,"Oh, I can imagine. I expect a proper explanation for all of this."
s001_09_b3_e_46,Ugh... too loud... my head...
s001_09_b3_e_47,Who are you to call me loud?! I've got a right to be loud when I'm this angr...
s001_09_b3_e_48,...
s001_09_b3_e_49,Is this the child?
s001_09_b3_e_50,Yes.
s001_09_b3_e_51,...
s001_09_b3_e_52,Come in.
s001_09_b3_e_53,Her Highness is waiting.
s001_09_b3_e_54,Ugh... wait...
s001_09_b3_e_55,My stomach doesn't feel good.
s001_09_b3_e_56,What's wrong with you?
s001_09_b3_e_57,What happened on the way here?
s001_09_b3_e_58,A whole lot.
s001_09_b3_e_59,Hurry up and get inside.
s001_09_b3_e_60,"I don't have much, but I've at least got some basic medicine."
s001_09_b3_e_61,Chime grabs Marian's arm and slings it across her shoulder.
s001_09_b3_e_62,"As Marian's arm grazes Chime's back, she winces."
s001_09_b3_e_63,Ewwww...
s001_09_b3_e_64,...
s001_09_b3_e_65,Ugh... Sorry...
s001_09_b3_e_66,Ugh...
s001_09_b3_e_67,Er...
s001_10_title,Second Affection: 10
s001_10_1,...
s001_10_2,...
s001_10_3,Is something wrong?
s001_10_4,"I've got a killer migraine, that's what."
s001_10_5,Are you sure you're not faking? You didn't experience any physical trauma.
s001_10_6,"Sure, but what about mental trauma?!"
s001_10_7,"Anyway,"
s001_10_8,I gave her some herbs that are good for hangovers.
s001_10_9,She's conked out now.
s001_10_10,Thank you.
s001_10_11,"So, tell me how it went."
s001_10_12,"There were some small issues along the way, but nothing major."
s001_10_13,Except for one thing
s001_10_14,that was rather strange.
s001_10_15,What is it?
s001_10_16,There hasn't been a single Rapture attack.
s001_10_17,Isn't that because of Rapunzel's hair?
s001_10_18,Rapunzel's hair isn't fool-proof. It simply lowers the probability of an encounter.
s001_10_19,It's been two whole weeks and we haven't encountered a single Rapture.
s001_10_20,Do you think it's somehow related to that girl?
s001_10_21,"Maybe... no, definitely."
s001_10_22,Got it. I'll keep that in mind.
s001_10_23,What about Crown?
s001_10_24,On the way here.
s001_10_25,"Hello, Snow White."
s001_10_26,It's been a while.
s001_10_27,I hope you've been in good health.
s001_10_28,...?
s001_10_29,"Hey, you ingrate! Her Highness is talking to you!"
s001_10_30,"Alright, alright."
s001_10_31,"So, the girl is sleeping? It must have been a difficult trip for her."
s001_10_32,I appreciate you doing this.
s001_10_33,Hmm...
s001_10_34,I sense a vibration.
s001_10_35,"I mean, I'm hungry, but my stomach doesn't growl that much."
s001_10_36,Inbound Raptures?
s001_10_37,"Yes, a large one."
s001_10_38,Pirate-Class.
s001_10_39,"Hehe, we're amongst friends, Your Highness."
s001_10_40,Using our secret code names for the Raptures might prove to be a slight headache for our new arrival.
s001_10_41,I believe we can safely refer to them as Tyrant-Class.
s001_10_42,"Oh, er... very well. My apologies, caution is simply in a Queen's nature."
s001_10_43,"At any rate, a Tyrant-Class Rapture is headed our way."
s001_10_44,It must have followed us.
s001_10_45,Let me deal with it.
s001_10_46,I'll take care of it as I'm leaving.
s001_10_47,Let us help you.
s001_10_48,No. You take care of Marian.
s001_10_49,Things might get chaotic when she wakes up.
s001_10_50,I'll leave her to you.
s001_10_51,Do you have any messages for her?
s001_10_52,"Tell her I'll be back for her, and to take care of herself in the meantime."
s001_10_53,All right.
s001_10_54,"Don't worry, we'll take care of her."
s001_10_55,I know you will.
s001_10_56,Are you leaving straight away?
s001_10_57,Yes.
s001_10_58,Are you serious?!
s001_10_59,"First you take forever and a day to get here, and then you leave almost immediately!"
s001_10_60,"Next time, I'll know better than to prepare anything when you say you'll be coming."
s001_10_61,At least prepare me a meal.
s001_10_62,Grrr...
s001_10_63,Take this.
s001_10_64,Snow White hands three capsules to Crown.
s001_10_65,What is this?
s001_10_66,"If any black light starts emanating from Marian's body, use these."
s001_10_67,"They contain trace amounts of Vapaus, and will put any nanomachines out of commission."
s001_10_68,It will prevent her from transforming.
s001_10_69,Noted.
s001_10_70,I'm off.
s001_10_71,Be careful.
s001_10_72,Snow White walks away.
s001_10_73,... Argh. No social skills whatsoever.
s001_10_74,...
s001_10_75,...
s001_10_76,"Well then, shall we roll out the red carpet for our new citizen?"
s001_10_77,"Yes, Your Highness!"
s001_11_title,Second Affection: 11
s001_11_1,Three days later.
s001_11_2,You didn't eat anything again?
s001_11_3,"Nikkes may not have to eat in order to survive, but it can be a real boost for your mental health to do so."
s001_11_4,...
s001_11_5,Say something.
s001_11_6,"If you just sit there and give us the silent treatment, there's nothing we can do to help you."
s001_11_7,...
s001_11_8,Fine. I'll wait.
s001_11_9,I'll leave this here. Make sure you eat it.
s001_11_10,Chime leaves the plate of food and leaves the room.
s001_11_11,...
s001_11_12,She hasn't eaten anything or said a word for three days?
s001_11_13,Yes. It must be hard for her to accept.
s001_11_14,"I'm sure being ousted from the Ark was traumatic for her, but thankfully she's got some friends in the Goddess Squad."
s001_11_15,"Be that as it may, the fact still stands that when she woke up, everyone was gone."
s001_11_16,I'm sure she thinks she has been abandoned.
s001_11_17,"It's a tragic state of affairs, but time will solve it."
s001_11_18,"For the moment, our hands our tied. All we can do is wait for her to..."
s001_11_19,She even dares not to see the Queen when she pays her a visit.
s001_11_20,I won't stand for it!
s001_11_21,...
s001_11_22,"Chime, starting from today, I don't want you paying Marian any more visits."
s001_11_23,I will do it.
s001_11_24,"What's your plan, Your Highness?"
s001_11_25,I shall treat her with the dignity that a Queen is capable of.
s001_11_26,...
s001_11_27,I would advise against that. You mustn't stoop so low as to appease her.
s001_11_28,"I said I would do it, and so I will."
s001_11_29,O-okay.
s001_11_30,Crown stands up.
s001_11_31,Marian's room.
s001_11_32,...
s001_11_33,*Thud*
s001_11_34,*Squeak... Thud*
s001_11_35,"Crown opens the door, enters, and brings over a chair to sit down."
s001_11_36,...
s001_11_37,...
s001_11_38,...
s001_11_39,...
s001_11_40,The two women stare at each other blankly without exchanging any words.
s001_11_41,"They continue to do so until night has fallen,"
s001_11_42,at which point Crown stands up and leaves the room.
s001_11_43,...
s001_11_44,*Sob*
s001_11_45,Commander...
s001_11_46,"For the rest of the night, Crown listens to Marian crying behind the door."
s001_11_47,Morning comes.
s001_11_48,*Thud*
s001_11_49,*Squeak... Thud*
s001_11_50,"Crown opens the door, enters, and brings over a chair to sit down."
s001_11_51,...
s001_11_52,...
s001_11_53,"Night falls once again,"
s001_11_54,Crown stands up and leaves the room
s001_11_55,and listens to Marian crying from behind the door.
s001_11_56,And so this process repeats.
s001_11_57,"On the next day,"
s001_11_58,and the day after that.
s001_11_59,"Crown sits opposite Marian, her usual wordless self."
s001_11_60,Morning comes.
s001_11_61,*Thud*
s001_11_62,*Squeak... Thud*
s001_11_63,"Crown opens the door, enters, and brings over a chair to sit down."
s001_11_64,Why aren't you saying anything?
s001_11_65,My kind does not speak unless it is necessary.
s001_11_66,What are you doing here?
s001_11_67,I'm observing one of my subjects.
s001_11_68,What are you talking about?
s001_11_69,"The moment you entered my kingdom, you became one of its citizens."
s001_11_70,...
s001_11_71,"I irritate you, don't I?"
s001_11_72,Not at all.
s001_11_73,Why not?
s001_11_74,I know other people feel that way.
s001_11_75,The Commander and the others... they all hate me.
s001_11_76,I'm useless. All I do is drag people down.
s001_11_77,"In your current state, it is true that you're of no help to anyone."
s001_11_78,...!
s001_11_79,But I will protect you nonetheless.
s001_11_80,You don't know me.
s001_11_81,You're only doing that because you were ordered to.
s001_11_82,"It is a Queen's duty to protect her subjects,"
s001_11_83,and so that is precisely what I will do.
s001_11_84,...
s001_11_85,Fine.
s001_11_86,"Since I'm not helpful in any way, I'll leave."
s001_11_87,Where will you go?
s001_11_88,I...
s001_11_89,Where...
s001_11_90,!!
s001_11_91,I'm going to see the Commander!
s001_11_92,I'm going to the Ark!
s001_11_93,Good. Let's go.
s001_11_94,I'll take you there.
s001_11_95,"The way there is fraught with peril, and so I will protect you."
s001_11_96,You will?
s001_11_97,"Did you get all that, Chime?"
s001_11_98,A voice rings out from behind the door.
s001_11_99,"Yes, Your Highness."
s001_11_100,And Trombe?
s001_11_101,On the way.
s001_11_102,*Jingle jingle*
s001_11_103,"The ground begins to shake, accompanied by the ringing of bells."
s001_11_104,Marian looks out the window.
s001_11_105,What is that...?
s001_11_106,"Out in the courtyard, a gleaming steel horse is standing."
s001_11_107,Let's go.
s001_12_title,Second Affection: 12
s001_12_1,"Under the moonlight, Trombe gallops with mighty fury,"
s001_12_2,with the three Nikkes astride.
s001_12_3,The moonlight and the wind part before them.
s001_12_4,To-too fast!
s001_12_5,I knew we'd be going at a snail's pace with three riders.
s001_12_6,"Still, at our current speed, we should be there in 4 days or so."
s001_12_7,Arrive where?
s001_12_8,Where else? The Ark.
s001_12_9,...!
s001_12_10,A-are we really going to the Ark?
s001_12_11,Isn't that where you said you wanted to go?
s001_12_12,"A Queen is dutybound to protect her subjects, and so we're accompanying you."
s001_12_13,...
s001_12_14,But it's dangerous.
s001_12_15,What is?
s001_12_16,"Everything! Not only will this put both of you in danger, but it'll also put the Commander in harm's way."
s001_12_17,That is true.
s001_12_18,But I will protect you all the same.
s001_12_19,"*Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop*"
s001_12_20,...
s001_12_21,"*Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop*"
s001_12_22,...
s001_12_23,"*Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop*"
s001_12_24,... Let's go back.
s001_12_25,Why? We've already made it this far.
s001_12_26,Go back. I'm sorry.
s001_12_27,...
s001_12_28,Your Highness...
s001_12_29,Trombe. Stop.
s001_12_30,Let's go back to the kingdom.
s001_12_31,"Trombe saunters slowly, carrying the three Nikkes on its back."
s001_12_32,"Across the dark plain, only the sound of clomping hooves fills the night air."
s001_12_33,...
s001_12_34,What are you thinking?
s001_12_35,... I'm sorry.
s001_12_36,I guess there was no other way.
s001_12_37,Everyone knew except for me.
s001_12_38,To be honest... I knew too.
s001_12_39,It's just that... it was all so sad.
s001_12_40,It felt like I was abandoned and all alone...
s001_12_41,You're not alone.
s001_12_42,You have me.
s001_12_43,Don't forget about me!
s001_12_44,"Don't you worry, Chime. I could never forget you."
s001_12_45,...
s001_12_46,"You came here not of your own volition, brought by others, and yet you have formed such a strong bond with the Queen."
s001_12_47,"As part of this kingdom, you are one of its subjects,"
s001_12_48,and with that divine right comes certain responsibilities.
s001_12_49,Like what?
s001_12_50,"You may do whatever you wish,"
s001_12_51,and the Queen will provide
s001_12_52,unequivocal protection.
s001_12_53,No matter what?
s001_12_54,"Yes, but you must consider carefully whether"
s001_12_55,what you are doing is what you truly desire.
s001_12_56,"So great is the Queen's nobility, and so majestic her power,"
s001_12_57,that she can make any of your wishes reality.
s001_12_58,Asking for the Queen's protection is not something that should be taken lightly.
s001_12_59,So you must think very hard before you act.
s001_12_60,...
s001_12_61,"Should you have a wish that you want to fulfill no matter the cost,"
s001_12_62,then you may speak with the Queen.
s001_12_63,"She will lend you her aid, and your wish will come true."
s001_12_64,Do you understand what I'm telling you?
s001_12_65,Yes. I think I understand.
s001_12_66,Miss...
s001_12_67,Call me Chime.
s001_12_68,"Chime, what is your wish?"
s001_12_69,It already came true.
s001_12_70,What was it?
s001_12_71,...
s001_12_72,I wished for a Queen.
s001_12_73,Then what is the wish of the Queen?
s001_12_74,To protect her subjects. That is all.
s001_12_75,My personal desires are of no importance.
s001_12_76,A Queen exists because of and for her subjects.
s001_12_77,...
s001_12_78,What a hard way to live.
s001_13_title,Second Affection: 13
s001_13_1,Eeeeeeeek!
s001_13_2,Marian!!!
s001_13_3,How many times must I tell you not to put those disgusting maggots on the table?!
s001_13_4,Maggots are super nutritious.
s001_13_5,"They're way healthier than any processed or canned food, that's for sure."
s001_13_6,"What does that matter, you dolt? We're Nikkes!"
s001_13_7,Why don't you quit hitting the bottle before talking about nutrition?
s001_13_8,Alcohol is the perfect cure for an ailing mind...
s001_13_9,That sounds just like something a drunk would say.
s001_13_10,"Your Highness, must I endure such unwarranted criticism?"
s001_13_11,This woman has made my meal times a living hell.
s001_13_12,Marian put a lot of thought into this meal.
s001_13_13,Be thankful and eat.
s001_13_14,"Not you too, Your Highness! How can you be so cruel?"
s001_13_15,"Hehe, thanks Crown. Don't forget to finish yours."
s001_13_16,Er... I'm a bit full actually.
s001_13_17,"While we're on the subject of health, I noticed that you've seemed a bit tired these days, so I brewed some snake wine for you, Crown."
s001_13_18,...
s001_13_19,Such insolence! How dare you say Her Highness's name as if she was your friend?!
s001_13_20,It's fine. It's nice being treated as an equal.
s001_13_21,"Hehe, you are most merciful, Crown."
s001_13_22,As any Queen should be.
s001_13_23,Wait right here. I'll go get the snake wine.
s001_13_24,...
s001_13_25,Marian opens the door and heads out.
s001_13_26,...
s001_13_27,Your Highness.
s001_13_28,Don't you think Marian changed a bit after that day?
s001_13_29,"It must be the adolescence kicking in. During adolescence, people tend to change every day."
s001_13_30,Chime glances around and then whispers softly.
s001_13_31,"You mean to say that she is growing, right?"
s001_13_32,"Um... Yes, that's exactly what I meant."
s001_13_33,She is growing up well.
s001_13_34,I don't think this can explain...
s001_13_35,Argh...
s001_13_36,"Are you okay, Your Highness?"
s001_13_37,I haven't been feeling well for the past few days.
s001_13_38,What?! This won't do. You must rest at once.
s001_13_39,I'll prepare a separate meal for you.
s001_13_40,If you would. Thank you.
s001_13_41,Crown gets up from her seat and heads into her room.
s001_13_42,...
s001_13_43,A moment later.
s001_13_44,Huh? Where's Crown?
s001_13_45,"She isn't feeling well, so she's resting."
s001_13_46,"Yeah, she hasn't been looking all that great for a few days now."
s001_13_47,Has something like this happened before?
s001_13_48,She has a difficult time whenever there's a high concentration of Alva particles.
s001_13_49,Is she sensitive to Alva particles?
s001_13_50,"Yes, but I can't tell you any more than that."
s001_13_51,Oh... what a letdown.
s001_13_52,I'll tell you later.
s001_13_53,Hehe. Okay.
s001_13_54,...
s001_13_55,"By the way, have you received any word from Snow White?"
s001_13_56,Nothing yet.
s001_13_57,...
s001_13_58,Are you still upset that she left without saying goodbye?
s001_13_59,Not at all.
s001_13_60,"They're busy people, and they have lots of important things to do."
s001_13_61,"Despite all that, they still brought me all the way out here, so I'm very grateful to them."
s001_13_62,It's just... I miss them.
s001_13_63,Now that I realize what they did for me.
s001_13_64,Hmm...
s001_13_65,I'm curious what they'd think of you now as well.
s001_13_66,Would you like to join me for a glass of snake wine?
s001_13_67,I found a classic movie. It's called My Frisky Stepsister: Part 3. We can watch that while having a few drinks.
s001_13_68,...
s001_14_title,Second Affection: 14
s001_14_1,Marian abruptly wakes up.
s001_14_2,"She looks beyond the castle gate outside the window,"
s001_14_3,and her expression darkens.
s001_14_4,She opens the door and heads out.
s001_14_5,Hmm?
s001_14_6,Marian? What are you doing at this hour?
s001_14_7,Do you need to use the bathroom?
s001_14_8,Wait just a sec. I'll go with you.
s001_14_9,"No, it's okay. I'm just having a hard time falling asleep."
s001_14_10,I was going to take a short walk outside for a few minutes.
s001_14_11,At this hour?
s001_14_12,Yeah.
s001_14_13,...
s001_14_14,"Okay. Just be careful, and don't venture outside the kingdom."
s001_14_15,I won't. Goodnight.
s001_14_16,By the way...
s001_14_17,Yes?
s001_14_18,How's Crown?
s001_14_19,... Still unwell. This time it's lasting longer than I thought.
s001_14_20,... I see. I hope she gets better soon.
s001_14_21,Don't worry. Her Highness is strong.
s001_14_22,I know.
s001_14_23,I'll be back.
s001_14_24,All right. Take care.
s001_14_25,Marian opens the door and heads out.
s001_14_26,Marian walks outside the castle wall.
s001_14_27,"After walking for a while, she stops."
s001_14_28,"Beyond the horizon, figures can be seen."
s001_14_29,Three Tyrant-class Raptures.
s001_14_30,Is the kingdom what they're after?
s001_14_31,"The castle walls are slowly losing their ability to conceal this place,"
s001_14_32,so more and more Raptures have been coming...
s001_14_33,...
s001_14_34,"If they breach the walls, Crown and Chime won't be able to stop them."
s001_14_35,"Crown is sick now, and Chime is not a combat Nikke."
s001_14_36,...
s001_14_37,I have to stop them.
s001_14_38,Have at you!
s001_14_b1_1,I can't allow you to come inside the kingdom.
s001_14_b1_2,I have to stop you here.
s001_14_b1_e_1,... Clear!
s001_14_b1_e_2,Next!
s001_14_b2_1,This is starting to wear me down...
s001_14_b2_2,But it's not over yet!
s001_14_b2_e_1,Phew...
s001_14_b2_e_2,Last one... I can do this!
s001_14_b3_1,You... shall not... pass!
s001_14_b3_e_1,Huff...! Huff...!
s001_14_b3_e_2,Phew...!
s001_14_b3_e_3,I did it... I...
s001_14_b3_e_4,*Thud* *Thud*
s001_14_b3_e_5,...
s001_14_b3_e_6,There's more?
s001_14_b3_e_7,*Thud* *Thud*
s001_14_b3_e_8,It's okay. I can do it.
s001_14_b3_e_9,Marian staggers.
s001_14_b3_e_10,Maybe... I overdid it a little...
s001_14_b3_e_11,*Thud* *Thud*
s001_14_b3_e_12,It doesn't matter.
s001_14_b3_e_13,Let's go!
s001_14_b3_e_14,*Thud* *Thud*
s001_14_b3_e_15,*Clip clop clip clop*
s001_14_b3_e_16,"Onward, Trombe!"
s001_14_b3_e_17,!!
s001_14_b3_e_18,Trombe and Crown soar past Marian in a flash and jump up.
s001_14_b3_e_19,Crown fires off one shot and scores a direct hit on the Rapture's core.
s001_14_b3_e_20,Crown!
s001_14_b3_e_21,"Chime, the sub-core."
s001_14_b3_e_22,On it!
s001_14_b3_e_23,Chime unloads a barrage of bullets which shatter the Rapture's sub-core.
s001_14_b3_e_24,"The hulking Rapture collapses to the ground, defeated."
s001_14_b3_e_25,*Crash*
s001_14_b3_e_26,...
s001_14_b3_e_27,Enemy down.
s001_14_b3_e_28,Well done.
s001_14_b3_e_29,Wha... how...
s001_14_b3_e_30,I'm supposed to be the one protecting you.
s001_14_b3_e_31,Not the other way around.
s001_14_b3_e_32,I thought you were sick?
s001_14_b3_e_33,I can overcome anything if my subjects need protection
s001_14_b3_e_34,I'm that important to you?
s001_14_b3_e_35,"Of course, and I hope you hold me in equally high esteem."
s001_14_b3_e_36,...
s001_14_b3_e_37,You idiot! You should have told us something!
s001_14_b3_e_38,You even lied to my face!
s001_14_b3_e_39,Hehe...
s001_14_b3_e_40,You're laughing?! You think this is funny?!
s001_14_b3_e_41,It's not that.
s001_14_b3_e_42,"When I saw those Raptures, I felt this power surge through me."
s001_14_b3_e_43,"I felt an irrepressible urge to protect the kingdom, and all those in it."
s001_14_b3_e_44,Did you all feel the same way?
s001_14_b3_e_45,Of course!
s001_14_b3_e_46,That is precisely what it means to protect someone you care about.
s001_14_b3_e_47,Ah...
s001_14_b3_e_48,Right... I see.
s001_14_b3_e_49,I understand now.
s001_14_b3_e_50,"If you protect me, and I protect you,"
s001_14_b3_e_51,there's no limit to how strong all of us can become.
s001_14_b3_e_52,No one has to get hurt.
s001_14_b3_e_53,It's so simple. I can't believe it took me so long to see it.
s001_14_b3_e_54,"The more things you share with someone, the greater your resolve becomes."
s001_14_b3_e_55,*Crack*
s001_14_b3_e_56,...?
s001_14_b3_e_57,"A black light emits from Marian's body,"
s001_14_b3_e_58,and she starts to transform.
s001_14_b3_e_59,Your Highness!
s001_14_b3_e_60,"No, this isn't what you think it is..."
s001_14_b3_e_61,*Crack*
s001_14_b3_e_62,...
s001_14_b3_e_63,Marian... your body...
s001_14_b3_e_64,Commander. Rapi. Anis. Neon.
s001_14_b3_e_65,Snow White. Scarlet. Rapunzel.
s001_14_b3_e_66,... Crown and Chime.
s001_14_b3_e_67,"Protect me,"
s001_14_b3_e_68,and I will do the same.
s001_14_b3_e_69,I promise you.
s001_14_b3_e_70,I'll protect all of you.
s001_14_b3_e_71,SECOND AFFECTION: END
s001_15_title,Second Passion: Epilogue
s001_15_1,"Your Highness,"
s001_15_2,we've got a big problem.
s001_15_3,"What is it, Chime?"
s001_15_4,"While I was surveying the surroundings with a telescope, I saw a massive explosion."
s001_15_5,Big enough to be seen from a distance.
s001_15_6,It came from the direction of the Ark.
s001_15_7,!!
s001_15_8,...
s001_15_9,I think something's happened there.
s001_15_10,Make preparations to leave.
s001_15_11,Are you planning on going there yourself?
s001_15_12,Yes. I have to.
s001_15_13,Understood. I'll accompany you.
s001_15_14,Marian...
s001_15_15,I'll wait here.
s001_15_16,"I want to go with you, but that might only make things more dangerous."
s001_15_17,Thank you for understanding.
s001_15_18,Are you gonna be okay here on your own?
s001_15_19,Hehe. Of course.
s001_15_20,All right.
s001_15_21,Do you have anything you want to say to him?
s001_15_22,Hmm? You mean the Commander?
s001_15_23,Yes.
s001_15_24,Why would...
s001_15_25,I have a feeling I might meet him.
s001_15_26,"When I listened to your stories, it seems like he's usually involved in most major events."
s001_15_27,...
s001_15_28,"If you see the Commander,"
s001_15_29,just...
s001_15_30,Tell him I'm doing well.
s001_15_31,... Okay.
s001_15_32,"Let's go, Chime."
s001_15_33,"Yes, Your Highness."
s001_15_34,Crown and Chime head outside.
s001_15_35,...
s001_15_36,Commander...
s001_15_37,Will we ever meet again?
s002_01_title,WORDLESS: 1
s002_01_1,Yuni.
s002_01_2,...
s002_01_3,Your punishment has been decided.
s002_01_4,Am... Am I going to be killed?
s002_01_5,I don't know.
s002_01_6,...
s002_01_7,The officials will arrive in an hour.
s002_01_8,Wait here until then.
s002_01_9,Is...
s002_01_10,Is Mihara awake?
s002_01_11,I cannot divulge that information.
s002_01_12,Has Mihara recovered from her injuries?
s002_01_13,I cannot divulge that information.
s002_01_14,C-can't I meet her?
s002_01_15,That won't be possible.
s002_01_16,"Please, let me see her... just once?"
s002_01_17,"I've already told you, that's impossible."
s002_01_18,You cannot meet anyone until your punishment is carried out.
s002_01_19,Such is the decree.
s002_01_20,Please... just one more time? Let me see her.
s002_01_21,No.
s002_01_22,Only for a minute... just for a brief moment. Just let me see her face!
s002_01_23,"In case you've forgotten,"
s002_01_24,you have committed a crime.
s002_01_25,Many people lost their lives because of you.
s002_01_26,"They, too, had things they wished for."
s002_01_27,People whom they wanted to see again.
s002_01_28,...!
s002_01_29,Now they can no longer meet their loved ones.
s002_01_30,So you don't get to meet with anyone either.
s002_01_31,...
s002_01_32,I...
s002_01_33,"If you were smart, you would beg for forgiveness from the victims and await your punishment."
s002_01_34,...
s002_01_35,I'll see you momentari...
s002_01_36,*Crash*
s002_01_37,"As Mana turns to leave, Yuni drops to her knees and grasps at Mana's legs."
s002_01_38,I-I'm sorry. *Sob* I was wrong...
s002_01_39,What are you doing?!
s002_01_40,"I'm so sorry! So, so sorry!"
s002_01_41,*Sob sob sob* I-I'll atone for my sins for the rest of my life. I'll never stop begging for forgiveness.
s002_01_42,Get up.
s002_01_43,"Even if I don't get to see her,"
s002_01_44,just tell her one thing.
s002_01_45,"One sentence, please."
s002_01_46,I said get up!
s002_01_47,I'll accept any punishment.
s002_01_48,"No matter what happens to me, I won't challenge it."
s002_01_49,"Denounce me, curse me, beat and torture me."
s002_01_50,"I'll accept any punishment that's given to me, and I'll do whatever I'm told,"
s002_01_51,because I've sinned... I know this.
s002_01_52,I've taken other people's loved ones away from them.
s002_01_53,I was wrong... so wrong...
s002_01_54,"I'll spend the rest of my life begging for forgiveness, even if I have no hopes of ever receiving it."
s002_01_55,"Just please, let me say one thing to Mihara."
s002_01_56,Just one thing.
s002_01_57,"Yuni bows her head towards the floor,"
s002_01_58,...
s002_01_59,and grasps at Mana's legs with sad desperation.
s002_01_60,Please... Please...
s002_01_61,*Shivering*
s002_01_62,*Sob* Help me... just this once...
s002_01_63,*Sigh*
s002_01_64,...
s002_01_65,Fine. I'll hear you out.
s002_01_66,What is it that you want to say?
s002_02_title,WORDLESS: 2
s002_02_1,How are you feeling?
s002_02_2,Good.
s002_02_3,"No issues with my vision, hearing, smell, taste, or touch."
s002_02_4,Any headaches?
s002_02_5,"Hehe, none whatsoever."
s002_02_6,"The doctors did such a great job treating me that I don't feel any pain at all, unfortunately."
s002_02_7,Unfortunately?! Why would you say such a thing?
s002_02_8,Your brain damage was so severe that it was almost impossible to regenerate with the NIMPH alone.
s002_02_9,Why do you think you were taken to the Repair Center immediately after being deployed from the Missilis Research Institute?
s002_02_10,That's how serious the situation was!
s002_02_11,Hmm... I guess.
s002_02_12,What the... why are you being so nonchalant?! You should be taking this more seriously!
s002_02_13,"If you ask me, you should be resting at the Repair Center for a while longer."
s002_02_14,Why did Missilis suddenly request you to return in such a hurry?
s002_02_15,The higher-ups probably believe that they've allowed me ample time.
s002_02_16,"Usually, we're asked to return straight after being deployed."
s002_02_17,The fact that they allowed me to visit the Repair Center in the first place is already quite generous.
s002_02_18,...
s002_02_19,"Through the data I received, I've learned what kind of person I was in the past."
s002_02_20,"From the records stored in NIMPH, I've also recalled how to use my abilities."
s002_02_21,"I'm also not feeling any pain,"
s002_02_22,so I think it's time to get back to work.
s002_02_23,"If you feel even the slightest bit of pain,"
s002_02_24,"be sure to come straight to the hospital, okay? It doesn't matter what time of day."
s002_02_25,"Yes yes, I understand."
s002_02_26,Ugh... honestly...
s002_02_27,"Haha,"
s002_02_28,"you should really try and take this a little more seriously, Mihara."
s002_02_29,"Even though a new NIMPH was used to regenerate the old data,"
s002_02_30,"since the brain itself was physically damaged, we're still unsure as to whether there will be any side effects."
s002_02_31,"Even while we were conducting surgery, the NIMPH thought it was being physically attacked at one point and went wild."
s002_02_32,"If there are still parts of your brain which have sustained damage,"
s002_02_33,"we might not be able to treat them, depending on the severity."
s002_02_34,...
s002_02_35,"So, if you feel any pain at all, you must come to us immediately."
s002_02_36,Understood?
s002_02_37,"All right, yes. I'll keep that in mind."
s002_02_38,Don't you two worry yourselves too much.
s002_02_39,"Fine. If I keep belaboring the point, I'll just be nagging you, so I'll stop here."
s002_02_40,Thanks for taking care of me.
s002_02_41,Don't mention it. We're doctors. Taking care of patients is what we do.
s002_02_42,"Hehe, that's right!"
s002_02_43,"Hehe, well, you're quite the skilled doctors."
s002_02_44,"Oh, by the way, Mihara."
s002_02_45,When you return to Missilis... Are you going to visit her?
s002_02_46,Yes. I need to go see her.
s002_02_47,... Yuni.
s002_03_title,WORDLESS: 3
s002_03_1,Hello there.
s002_03_2,Hmm... I believe I've seen you in the data.
s002_03_3,"Mana, was it?"
s002_03_4,"Yes,"
s002_03_5,that's right.
s002_03_6,I heard you were sent to the Repair Center.
s002_03_7,How are you feeling?
s002_03_8,"Much better now, thanks to the good doctors."
s002_03_9,Glad to hear it.
s002_03_10,"As I'm sure you're aware, Syuen sent an urgent summons for you."
s002_03_11,I heard it was because she wanted me to quit lazing about and get back to work.
s002_03_12,"Apparently, the message was delivered sans filter."
s002_03_13,That it was.
s002_03_14,Syuen has ordered that the Wardress Squad be put back into action.
s002_03_15,"After it was revealed that the culprits behind this terror attack were Nikkes belonging to Missilis, our reputation has plummeted."
s002_03_16,"We need results, and we're willing to do anything to achieve them."
s002_03_17,"Therefore, every single one of our available squads:"
s002_03_18,"Matis, M.M.R., Mighty Tools, Electric Shock."
s002_03_19,"They're all being issued one command, and one command only: to fix the company's image by any means necessary."
s002_03_20,I see.
s002_03_21,"For that reason, the Wardress Squad has been ordered to go up to the surface"
s002_03_22,and take down some rare Rapture types.
s002_03_23,"In other words, what we were originally meant to do."
s002_03_24,Correct.
s002_03_25,Does that mean I no longer need to guard Syuen?
s002_03_26,"According to the data I've received, that appears to have been our primary responsibility."
s002_03_27,In light of everything that has occurred...
s002_03_28,that will no longer be necessary.
s002_03_29,!!
s002_03_30,Hehe. Makes sense.
s002_03_31,She was harmed by those who should have protected her. I can see why she doesn't want to keep us around anymore.
s002_03_32,...
s002_03_33,I apologize for asking something so obvious.
s002_03_34,"No, it's fine."
s002_03_35,When should we head to the surface?
s002_03_36,As soon as possible.
s002_03_37,Within a week at the latest.
s002_03_38,Got it.
s002_03_39,I should hurry and go see Yuni.
s002_03_40,... Okay.
s002_03_41,... Can I ask you to show me the way?
s002_03_42,Is it okay for Yuni to be outside?
s002_03_43,Didn't Syuen oppose it?
s002_03_44,"Like I told you, we have to achieve results by all the means at our disposal."
s002_03_45,It would appear that using Yuni was deemed more advantageous than keeping her confined.
s002_03_46,Heh. Typical Missilis.
s002_03_47,"Besides, she has already been punished."
s002_03_48,Punished?
s002_03_49,She's a terrorist who caused unprecedented casualties.
s002_03_50,A danger to society who nearly assassinated a CEO of one of the Big Three.
s002_03_51,"It is a grave crime that she committed, and as a consequence of her actions,"
s002_03_52,she is no longer what she used to be.
s002_03_53,What do you mean?
s002_03_54,Mana stops in front of a thick door.
s002_03_55,We've arrived.
s002_03_56,This is where they're keeping Yuni in solitary confinement.
s002_03_57,...
s002_03_58,Go inside.
s002_03_59,... All right.
s002_03_60,*Creak* *Bang!*
s002_03_61,Mihara walks into the room.
s002_03_62,...
s002_03_63,Hmm?
s002_03_64,Coo?
s002_03_65,What? Who is this?
s002_03_66,They're too big to be Yuni.
s002_03_67,...
s002_03_68,Where's Yuni?
s002_03_69,I assure you that we're in the correct location.
s002_03_70,This is where Yuni is being kept.
s002_03_71,Then could it be...
s002_03_72,Coo?
s002_03_73,Yuni...?
s002_03_74,"Yes. That person over there is your partner, Yuni."
s002_04_title,WORDLESS: 4
s002_04_1,Th... That's Yuni?
s002_04_2,Mihara looks again at the mysterious individual who is alleged to be Yuni.
s002_04_3,"They are a hulking figure, bound with various straps, and their face covered with a mask."
s002_04_4,The only semblance of the past Yuni is the pink hair.
s002_04_5,The legs are reminiscent of those of a Rapture's.
s002_04_6,...
s002_04_7,"Before her stands something neither human, nor Nikke nor Rapture."
s002_04_8,What is this? I thought Yuni was a Nikke?
s002_04_9,"Like I told you, her appearance has been altered."
s002_04_10,As part of her punishment? Is that why she looks like this?
s002_04_11,That's correct.
s002_04_12,I see...
s002_04_13,"Coo, coo?"
s002_04_14,Yuni tilts her head.
s002_04_15,Can she not speak?
s002_04_16,No. All of her language capabilities have been removed.
s002_04_17,Yuni used her words to perpetrate her crime.
s002_04_18,... That's right.
s002_04_19,"As for her appearance,"
s002_04_20,"although it is far from typical, she can still be classified as a Nikke."
s002_04_21,"Therefore, her NIMPH was forcibly reinstalled."
s002_04_22,"However, unless permitted, she will not be able to use any of her unique abilities."
s002_04_23,"Within the Ark, she is permitted only to frequent the Rehabilitation Center and the M.M.R. research lab."
s002_04_24,"If, after going up to the surface, she does not return to the Ark promptly and punctually, her head will explode."
s002_04_25,What?!
s002_04_26,Do you see those restraints covering her chest?
s002_04_27,Restraints? The one with the heart on it?
s002_04_28,Inside that is a bomb with a greater power than the chokers used by Exotic.
s002_04_29,!!
s002_04_30,A bomb?!
s002_04_31,If she ventures too far from the Ark
s002_04_32,"or if she doesn't come back and get it swapped out for a new one, it will detonate."
s002_04_33,"So, as I said before, you must not forget to have her report into the Ark regularly, even while she is carrying out a mission."
s002_04_34,Yes. I understand.
s002_04_35,...
s002_04_36,Mihara looks at Yuni again.
s002_04_37,Her legs...
s002_04_38,Have they fused them with Raptures' parts?
s002_04_39,Yes.
s002_04_40,"As you are a squad intended to eliminate Raptures, some upgrades were deemed necessary."
s002_04_41,She underwent experimental surgery to see if enhancing Nikkes with Rapture parts was possible.
s002_04_42,Did Enikk decide that?
s002_04_43,No. Enikk's decision was
s002_04_44,to re-install the removed NIMPH and
s002_04_45,"have her dedicate the rest of her life to serving humanity, to compensate for the harm she caused."
s002_04_46,"At least, that's my understanding of the situation."
s002_04_47,The order to carry out this surgery came from Jien.
s002_04_48,Jien?
s002_04_49,"Ah, right."
s002_04_50,"You've been redeployed, so you wouldn't know."
s002_04_51,Jien is Syuen's half-sister.
s002_04_52,Syuen has a half-sister?
s002_04_53,"If Jien is so important, why isn't she mentioned in any official databases?"
s002_04_54,She prefers staying out of the public eye.
s002_04_55,"Only those closest to Syuen, like you and the M.M.R. Squad, know of her existence."
s002_04_56,"In that sense,"
s002_04_57,her involvement in Yuni's punishment this time is truly an exceptional case.
s002_04_58,Why didn't Syuen handle it herself?
s002_04_59,Syuen gets a searing headache whenever Yuni is brought up.
s002_04_60,"I heard that Jien reported it to Syuen, but I don't know if she agreed to it."
s002_04_61,... I see.
s002_04_62,Coo?
s002_04_63,...
s002_04_64,That's all I know.
s002_04_65,Do you have any more questions?
s002_04_66,Does Yuni... still have her memories?
s002_04_67,You mean before the punishment?
s002_04_68,Yes.
s002_04_69,"In the process of reinstalling the NIMPH,"
s002_04_70,it is common to enact a memory wipe in order to prevent a Mind Switch.
s002_04_71,We cannot know for sure if Yuni underwent that process.
s002_04_72,All the experimental procedures were conducted in secret
s002_04_73,by a team composed only of Jien and those she designated. Not even the M.M.R. researchers could access files on it.
s002_04_74,I see.
s002_04_75,Do you have any more questions?
s002_04_76,No. I think that's all.
s002_04_77,"All right, then I'll take my leave."
s002_04_78,Thank you for showing me the way.
s002_04_79,*Creak* *Thud!*
s002_04_80,Mana leaves the room.
s002_04_81,...
s002_04_82,Sorry about that.
s002_04_83,We were talking amongst ourselves and acting like you didn't exist.
s002_04_84,We should have been more considerate.
s002_04_85,??
s002_04_86,"My goodness, I haven't even introduced myself yet."
s002_04_87,"Hello, I'm Mihara."
s002_04_88,"You're Yuni, right? I believe we're supposed to be working together."
s002_04_89,!!
s002_04_90,Uh...
s002_04_91,"We're a team now, so we should try and get along."
s002_04_92,"Coo, coo, coo."
s002_04_93,"So... what do you like, Yuni?"
s002_04_94,"Coo, coo, coo!"
s002_04_95,Huh?
s002_04_96,"Coo, coo, coo!"
s002_04_97,Yuni...?
s002_04_98,"Coo, coo, coo!"
s002_04_99,What's wrong? Are you hurt?
s002_04_100,Cooooooo!!
s002_04_101,Yuni starts writhing and howling.
s002_04_102,!!
s002_04_103,What's wrong?!
s002_04_104,Coooo! Coooo!
s002_04_105,C-calm down!
s002_04_106,Mihara hugs Yuni tightly.
s002_04_107,!!
s002_04_108,Yuni stops writhing.
s002_04_109,Coooo... Coooo...
s002_04_110,"Good, that's it. Try and calm down."
s002_04_111,...
s002_04_112,Good job.
s002_04_113,...
s002_04_114,What was that?
s002_04_115,Were you trying to tell me something?
s002_04_116,...
s002_04_117,"Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo...?"
s002_04_118,Huh?
s002_04_119,"Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo?"
s002_04_120,Um... sorry.
s002_04_121,I can't understand what you're saying.
s002_04_122,"... Cooo, co, coo, coo?"
s002_04_123,"It feels like she wants to tell me something,"
s002_04_124,but does she even understand what I'm saying?
s002_04_125,Cooo... co... coo... coo...
s002_04_126,"It almost sounds like she's crying,"
s002_04_127,but it also sounds like she's intentionally repeating the same sound over and over.
s002_04_128,Is it just my imagination?
s002_04_129,Coooo?
s002_04_130,...
s002_04_131,Um.
s002_04_132,"If this is what our communication is going to be like,"
s002_04_133,and we're supposed to be going out on missions together...
s002_04_134,This could be a problem.
s002_05_title,WORDLESS: 5
s002_05_1,The next day.
s002_05_2,Mihara goes to see Yuni.
s002_05_3,"Hi, Yuni."
s002_05_4,How have you been?
s002_05_5,??
s002_05_6,Can you eat?
s002_05_7,"Coo, coo..."
s002_05_8,Did you sleep well?
s002_05_9,"Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo?"
s002_05_10,Again... that same sound.
s002_05_11,Is it really just a crying sound?
s002_05_12,Can't you make any other sounds?
s002_05_13,??
s002_05_14,Forget it. It's nothing.
s002_05_15,The next day.
s002_05_16,"Hi, Yuni."
s002_05_17,Have you been well today?
s002_05_18,??
s002_05_19,"We should prepare for the missions we've got to do up on the surface,"
s002_05_20,so why don't we come up with some hand signals today?
s002_05_21,Coooo...
s002_05_22,Hand signals just for us.
s002_05_23,"Cooo, co, coo, coo?"
s002_05_24,Huh?
s002_05_25,"Cooo, co, coo, coo?"
s002_05_26,That sound again...
s002_05_27,This really is a problem.
s002_05_28,"Communication is impossible like this,"
s002_05_29,and we don't have much time.
s002_05_30,??
s002_05_31,"Haha, I will say that you look cuter each time I see you."
s002_05_32,Maybe I could try talking to you more.
s002_05_33,The day after.
s002_05_34,"Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo..."
s002_05_35,You're clearly speaking with a deliberate rhythm.
s002_05_36,I know you're doing more than crying.
s002_05_37,You're trying to tell me something.
s002_05_38,"... Cooo, cooo."
s002_05_39,Yuni.
s002_05_40,What are you trying to say?
s002_05_41,What do you want to tell me?
s002_05_42,Cooo?
s002_05_43,This can't go on.
s002_05_44,I have to figure this out somehow.
s002_06_title,WORDLESS: 6
s002_06_1,Have you ever dealt with wild animals?
s002_06_2,Excuse me?
s002_06_3,"Did you say ""wild animals""?"
s002_06_4,Yeah.
s002_06_5,"Yuni has been fraternizing with some rough customers in the Rehabilitation Center, so she's become a bit... feral."
s002_06_6,...
s002_06_7,!!
s002_06_8,"Are you saying that Yuni's demeanor is savage in nature, even around you?"
s002_06_9,To the point where you can't communicate?
s002_06_10,That's not it.
s002_06_11,"She can't speak, but she still listens to me."
s002_06_12,"Actually, she's kinda cute."
s002_06_13,"So she listens to you, but you're unable to communicate?"
s002_06_14,That doesn't make any sense.
s002_06_15,Pepper.
s002_06_16,Let's not dig too deep into this.
s002_06_17,I'm sure there are numerous reasons why Mihara chose to use the wild animal metaphor to describe the situation.
s002_06_18,"Isn't that right, Mihara?"
s002_06_19,Precisely! Thank you for being so considerate.
s002_06_20,!!
s002_06_21,"Oh, I see!"
s002_06_22,I'm sorry for prying without knowing anything.
s002_06_23,It's okay.
s002_06_24,That tells me you're concerned about me.
s002_06_25,"So thanks, Pepper."
s002_06_26,Mihara.
s002_06_27,Do you want to speak with the person you're talking about?
s002_06_28,No. I think that's impossible for many reasons.
s002_06_29,Her not being able to speak is a form of punishment.
s002_06_30,I see.
s002_06_31,So you just want to be able to be understood?
s002_06_32,Yes. Just being able to communicate is enough.
s002_06_33,"With how she is now, I can't imagine us being able to carry out missions together."
s002_06_34,"Hmm... if communication is your main goal,"
s002_06_35,I think you'd be better off consulting with an animal expert.
s002_06_36,An animal expert?
s002_06_37,Have you heard of the Happy Zoo Squad?
s002_06_38,I'm pretty sure I've seen their name pop up in some documents.
s002_06_39,They're a squad formed for the purpose of animal protection.
s002_06_40,That's right.
s002_06_41,"Animals are their specialty, and one of them is especially skilled in handling wild animals."
s002_06_42,"Oh, you mean Leona! She would definitely be helpful!"
s002_06_43,My thoughts exactly.
s002_06_44,Leona?
s002_06_45,She's a Nikke who walks around with a super cute and oversized lion.
s002_06_46,... Come again?
s002_06_47,"Timi is the cutest, and he's huuuuuuge!"
s002_06_48,That makes him even cuter.
s002_06_49,"Haha, really?"
s002_06_50,I'd love to meet him in person.
s002_06_51,Would you like us to contact Leona?
s002_06_52,Would that be okay?
s002_06_53,Of course. I'm sure she'd be more than happy to help.
s002_06_54,Um... is your friend able to come out here with you?
s002_06_55,!!
s002_06_56,"Sorry, but I don't think that's possible."
s002_06_57,Leona would have to come to the Rehabilitation Center.
s002_06_58,So she'd have to sign a confidentiality agreement?
s002_06_59,Um... probably?
s002_06_60,All right.
s002_06_61,I'll run it by her and see if she's okay with it.
s002_06_62,Thank you. I'll make sure on my end to get approval for a visitor at the center.
s002_06_63,Sounds good. I'll contact you when I've got news.
s002_07_title,WORDLESS: 7
s002_07_1,Nice to meet you. My name's Mihara.
s002_07_2,And I'm Leona.
s002_07_3,This is Timi.
s002_07_4,"Oh my, I've heard a lot about you, Timi."
s002_07_5,*Roar?*
s002_07_6,You're just as cute and cuddly as everyone says!
s002_07_7,*Roar!*
s002_07_8,"Hehe, Timi's a bit shy."
s002_07_9,"Anyway, Mary told me the whole sordid tale."
s002_07_10,So you want to know how to talk to someone who has become beastly?
s002_07_11,Thank you for coming. I know I'm asking a lot of you.
s002_07_12,"Not at all. In fact, this is quite easy."
s002_07_13,"Now, can you take me to this person you speak of?"
s002_07_14,"Hi, Yuni."
s002_07_15,"It's me, Mihara."
s002_07_16,??
s002_07_17,I brought some guests today.
s002_07_18,Would you like to come out and meet them?
s002_07_19,Cooo?
s002_07_20,Wait... don't tell me this is...?
s002_07_21,Yes.
s002_07_22,"This is my partner, Yuni. This is what has become of her."
s002_07_23,I know the name. She was a Nikke from your squad.
s002_07_24,But her legs...
s002_07_25,"She may look a bit different, but she's still a Nikke."
s002_07_26,These changes to her appearance were part of her punishment.
s002_07_27,I see.
s002_07_28,And I presume the reason why we had to sign a confidentiality agreement is because this is supposed to be kept under wraps?
s002_07_29,Precisely.
s002_07_30,They don't want word leaking out of these experiments with Nikkes and Raptures being merged.
s002_07_31,I can imagine. It would be the bombshell to end all bombshells.
s002_07_32,... Cooo?
s002_07_33,So she can't speak anymore?
s002_07_34,No. That's why I asked for your help.
s002_07_35,I understand.
s002_07_36,We'll do our best.
s002_07_37,...
s002_07_38,Leona stares into Yuni's eyes for a long time.
s002_07_39,Hello.
s002_07_40,...
s002_07_41,I'm Leona. This lion is Timi.
s002_07_42,...
s002_07_43,May I come closer?
s002_07_44,...
s002_07_45,Hmm...
s002_07_46,Mihara.
s002_07_47,"I'm sorry, but can you move to the door?"
s002_07_48,Huh? Sure.
s002_07_49,Mihara steps back.
s002_07_50,Coo?
s002_07_51,Yuni looks back at Mihara.
s002_07_52,As I thought. Yuni can't take her eyes off you.
s002_07_53,"No matter who appears or speaks to her,"
s002_07_54,you seem to be her top priority.
s002_07_55,I am?
s002_07_56,Yes.
s002_07_57,"If you come forward again, her eyes will follow you."
s002_07_58,Mihara steps forward again.
s002_07_59,"Coo, coo..."
s002_07_60,Yuni follows Mihara with her gaze.
s002_07_61,You're right.
s002_07_62,This may make it a bit difficult for me to understand what Yuni is saying.
s002_07_63,The most important point in communication
s002_07_64,is a desire in both parties to convey a message to the other.
s002_07_65,"Yuni, however, doesn't seem to care about anyone but you."
s002_07_66,Conveying a message...
s002_07_67,"Whether it's an expression of panic, love, or any other emotion,"
s002_07_68,"if someone doesn't look at the other person and doesn't have a genuine desire to convey anything,"
s002_07_69,it doesn't matter who you put in front of them.
s002_07_70,"They simply won't be able to converse, regardless of any linguistic barriers."
s002_07_71,I see.
s002_07_72,"In other words, Yuni wants to talk to you."
s002_07_73,"I'd say that's a good sign, wouldn't you?"
s002_07_74,"You want to talk to me, Yuni?"
s002_07_75,Coooo?
s002_07_76,...
s002_07_77,"It might not be easy,"
s002_07_78,"but if you both want to talk, there is still hope."
s002_07_79,"First, let's try communicating the way I talk to Timi."
s002_08_title,WORDLESS: 8
s002_08_1,"First, you have to look into each other's eyes."
s002_08_2,How come?
s002_08_3,There's a wealth of information contained in the eyes.
s002_08_4,You can understand a lot even without words.
s002_08_5,...
s002_08_6,Yuni.
s002_08_7,Mihara looks at Yuni.
s002_08_8,??
s002_08_9,Can you lower your head a little bit?
s002_08_10,I want to look into your eyes.
s002_08_11,Cooo?
s002_08_12,Hmm... maybe she doesn't understand.
s002_08_13,"If it seems like your words aren't getting through, try expressing yourself with your body."
s002_08_14,Use physical touch to communicate.
s002_08_15,Physical touch...
s002_08_16,Mihara reaches out to Yuni.
s002_08_17,"Yuni, come here."
s002_08_18,Coo?
s002_08_19,"Yuni lowers her head, bringing herself closer to Mihara."
s002_08_20,!!
s002_08_21,She really approached me!
s002_08_22,"Next, cup her cheeks with your hands."
s002_08_23,"Yuni, I'm just going to touch you for a moment, okay?"
s002_08_24,Mihara cups Yuni's cheeks.
s002_08_25,And look into her pupils.
s002_08_26,...
s002_08_27,...
s002_08_28,Mihara quietly looks into Yuni's eyes which are partially hidden behind the mask.
s002_08_29,They are fixated solely on her.
s002_08_30,Oh my goodness...
s002_08_31,"You have such beautiful eyes, Yuni."
s002_08_32,??
s002_08_33,"It's a shame I couldn't see them all that well, what with them being hidden behind this mask."
s002_08_34,Coo?
s002_08_35,I should have looked closer earlier.
s002_08_36,"I should have tried harder. I'm sorry, Yuni."
s002_08_37,Yuni shakes her head desperately.
s002_08_38,"Are you saying ""no""?"
s002_08_39,Cooo!
s002_08_40,Oh...
s002_08_41,Mihara looks into Yuni's unwavering eyes.
s002_08_42,Do you understand what I'm saying now?
s002_08_43,Cooo... Coooo!
s002_08_44,Have you understood everything
s002_08_45,I've been saying this whole time?
s002_08_46,Cooo.
s002_08_47,I should have known earlier.
s002_08_48,There's so much to see in your eyes.
s002_08_49,I'm glad I finally got a good look at you.
s002_08_50,I feel more like I can face the world now.
s002_08_51,"Cooo, cooo?"
s002_08_52,"Yuni, could you tell me again?"
s002_08_53,What you've been trying to say to me all this time.
s002_08_54,Coo...!
s002_08_55,Yuni's eyes start to tremble and she avoids Mihara's gaze.
s002_08_56,... Yuni?
s002_08_57,...
s002_08_58,Is it a hard story to tell? Can you not look me in the eye while you say it?
s002_08_59,Yuni shakes her head.
s002_08_60,Then could you tell me?
s002_08_61,I want to know what you're saying.
s002_08_62,"Coo, coo, coo..."
s002_08_63,"Yuni, whose eyes were wandering, cautiously looks back at Mihara."
s002_08_64,"Cooo... co, coo... coo?"
s002_08_65,Thank you so much for today.
s002_08_66,You did all the work. All I did was show you the way.
s002_08_67,I couldn't have done it without your advice.
s002_08_68,"Thanks to you, I know Yuni understands what I'm saying."
s002_08_69,That alone is more than I could have asked for.
s002_08_70,I'm glad I could help.
s002_08_71,"So, do you have any idea what Yuni wants to say?"
s002_08_72,"To be honest, I'm still not sure."
s002_08_73,"However,"
s002_08_74,the fact she's hesitant to speak while looking into my eyes bothers me.
s002_08_75,"She has something she wants to say to me,"
s002_08_76,but it feels too hard to say while looking at me. What could that be?
s002_08_77,Hmm...
s002_08_78,"Whenever Timi does that, it usually means he's done something wrong."
s002_08_79,"Oh, really?"
s002_08_80,Or when he wanted something but was too embarrassed to ask for it.
s002_08_81,Want something...
s002_08_82,One thing is for sure. The answer to this problem lies within Yuni.
s002_08_83,I was thinking the same...
s002_08_84,"If you can figure out what kind of person Yuni was in the past,"
s002_08_85,"and what she thought of you,"
s002_08_86,you'll know what it is that she wants to tell you.
s002_08_87,You're right.
s002_08_88,As long as you don't give up
s002_08_89,"and keep trying to understand her,"
s002_08_90,Yuni will eventually be able to get through to you and convey what she wants to tell you.
s002_08_91,"Fortunately, she clearly has a desire to talk to you."
s002_08_92,I'm sure you'll be able to have a conversation like before.
s002_08_93,Thank you.
s002_08_94,I think I have an idea of how to proceed.
s002_08_95,Glad to hear it!
s002_08_96,*Roar!*
s002_08_97,"Hehe, sounds like Timi is cheering you on as well."
s002_08_98,"Haha, thank you, Timi."
s002_08_99,Mihara pets Timi's head.
s002_08_100,"Well, we ought to get going."
s002_08_101,"Next time we meet, I hope to see you both talking to each other."
s002_08_102,I'll do my best.
s002_08_103,Leona and Timi leave.
s002_08_104,...
s002_08_105,Yuni's past and my past...
s002_08_106,...
s002_08_107,I wonder if that place is still intact.
s002_09_title,WORDLESS: 9
s002_09_1,The Wardress Squad.
s002_09_2,"In the wake of Project Matis, Syuen, the Missilis Industry CEO, created Nikkes harnessing her unique technology."
s002_09_3,Having failed to measure up to the feats accomplished by her predecessors
s002_09_4,she intended for the Nikkes from Project Wardress to establish her
s002_09_5,as a force to be reckoned with in the field of Nikke development.
s002_09_6,Mihara and Yuni.
s002_09_7,"The Wardress Squad, consisting of two Nikkes, was initiated with the success of Matis in mind."
s002_09_8,"Aiming to eliminate Heretics,"
s002_09_9,the project also intended to develop Nikkes which specialized in taking down Raptures.
s002_09_10,"However, the Wardress Squad's abilities failed to meet expectations."
s002_09_11,"Their attempts to eliminate their first target, the Rapture Chatterbox, were unsuccessful,"
s002_09_12,and their missions often resulted in failure.
s002_09_13,"Furthermore, it was revealed Syuen had a Commander carrying out illegal jobs for her."
s002_09_14,"As a result, Yuni and Mihara were to be subjected to a memory wipe."
s002_09_15,"Eventually, the project became more of a burden than a blessing, and something that was to be kept from the outside world."
s002_09_16,"Within Missilis, it came to be known as Syuen's Folly."
s002_09_17,Mihara stops in front of a door inside the Missilis Research Institute.
s002_09_18,...
s002_09_19,Mihara looks at the nameplate on the door.
s002_09_20,... Yuni.
s002_09_21,*Zing*
s002_09_22,Mihara opens the door.
s002_09_23,Mihara looks around Yuni's room.
s002_09_24,I knew it.
s002_09_25,The simple room is outfitted with the bare essentials:
s002_09_26,"a desk, an open wardrobe, a bare mattress, drawers, some empty boxes, and a trash can."
s002_09_27,Everything else had disappeared.
s002_09_28,Everything has been disposed of.
s002_09_29,They took everything for reference since she's a criminal.
s002_09_30,What's left...
s002_09_31,Mihara looks into the trash can.
s002_09_32,Just trash...
s002_09_33,Hmm?
s002_09_34,"Amongst the refuse, she catches a glimpse of a torn remnant from a photo."
s002_09_35,A photo?
s002_09_36,Mihara picks up the piece of the photo.
s002_09_37,...!
s002_09_38,"In the torn photo, Mihara is shown smiling."
s002_09_39,She has her hand on someone's shoulder.
s002_09_40,...
s002_09_41,*Clatter*
s002_09_42,Mihara pours out the contents of the trash can onto the desk.
s002_09_43,...
s002_09_44,"Among the scattered trash, she finds more pieces of the photo."
s002_09_45,Mihara gathers the torn fragments and attempts to piece them together.
s002_09_46,Is this... Syuen?
s002_09_47,"In the completed photo, Mihara stands behind Syuen and a girl with pink hair."
s002_09_48,"Mihara is smiling, and has her hand on the pink-haired girl's shoulder."
s002_09_49,I recognize this pink hair...
s002_09_50,Ugh...!
s002_09_51,My head... it hurts...
s002_09_52,*Zzzt-zzzt*
s002_09_53,Do we really need to take this?
s002_09_54,Uh... the ■■ team said it needed to be taken for ■■.
s002_09_55,■■ is right. The PR team requested it.
s002_09_56,They said they would use it for an article later.
s002_09_57,What kind of article?
s002_09_58,"Missilis' New CEO, Syuen,"
s002_09_59,Finally Perfects Independent Nikke Manufacturing Technology!
s002_09_60,That's what they were thinking for the title.
s002_09_61,It's a good one.
s002_09_62,"Hehe, the PR team is really going all out this time around."
s002_09_63,"Syuen, can you help us out?"
s002_09_64,Fine. I'll do it.
s002_09_65,*Zzzt-zzzt*
s002_09_66,■ni. Come here.
s002_09_67,Can ■■ stand ■■ to ■■?
s002_09_68,"Of course, come here."
s002_09_69,"Yu■, stand next to Syuen?"
s002_09_70,*Zzzt-zzzt*
s002_09_71,Don't just stand there like a bunch of idiots.
s002_09_72,Stand up straight for the picture.
s002_09_73,You're Nikkes that I created personally.
s002_09_74,I can't have you going around looking foolish.
s002_09_75,"Okay, Syuen."
s002_09_76,Ha■. Great.
s002_09_77,"■en, Mi■■, Yu■, photo together..."
s002_09_78,I■ happy.
s002_09_79,It's a ■ day.
s002_09_80,Isn't ■?
s002_09_81,Mihara.
s002_09_82,!!
s002_09_83,This memory...
s002_09_84,Mihara looks at the photo again.
s002_09_85,It... It's Yuni.
s002_09_86,*Knock knock*
s002_09_87,!!
s002_09_88,"They said they cleared everything,"
s002_09_89,but there are still photos left.
s002_09_90,... Mana?
s002_09_91,What brings you here?
s002_10_title,WORDLESS: 10
s002_10_1,The fact you've come to Yuni's room tells me
s002_10_2,"you want to know more about Yuni and me, is that right?"
s002_10_3,Is that what you think?
s002_10_4,Yes.
s002_10_5,"You should have been able to glean information about your past from the data, right?"
s002_10_6,I didn't expect it to contain everything.
s002_10_7,Especially stories pertaining to a convicted criminal like Yuni.
s002_10_8,"Certainly at least those would be omitted, right?"
s002_10_9,That's right.
s002_10_10,A newly manufactured Nikke
s002_10_11,cannot have sympathy for criminals or be otherwise influenced by their ideology.
s002_10_12,"Especially in light of the fact you were suspected of being Yuni's accomplice,"
s002_10_13,they would have been extra vigilant about erasing such information.
s002_10_14,"That's why I came here. I hoped to find something in Yuni's old room that could tell me more about her,"
s002_10_15,but there's nothing except this photo.
s002_10_16,There's hardly any reason for them to leave a criminal's belongings intact.
s002_10_17,"So, Mana, could you tell me?"
s002_10_18,About us.
s002_10_19,I'm afraid I can't do that.
s002_10_20,Fine.
s002_10_21,Then why did Yuni do what she did?
s002_10_22,I can't tell you.
s002_10_23,Why did she shoot Syuen?
s002_10_24,I can't tell you.
s002_10_25,"Okay, so I can't ask about anything related to the attack."
s002_10_26,Then can I ask about Syuen?
s002_10_27,What about her?
s002_10_28,Did Syuen hate us?
s002_10_29,...
s002_10_30,I heard we were always together.
s002_10_31,Did she keep us close simply so she could hurl abuses our way?
s002_10_32,...
s002_10_33,Because we were failures?
s002_10_34,... I don't know.
s002_10_35,Only Syuen would know what Syuen was thinking.
s002_10_36,"Hehe, I suppose you're right."
s002_10_37,Maybe I should go find her then.
s002_10_38,Mihara.
s002_10_39,"Sorry. I went too far, I know."
s002_10_40,But I hope you understand how desperate I am.
s002_10_41,Why are you so curious?
s002_10_42,Why?
s002_10_43,"At first, it was in hopes of making our communication a little smoother for the sake of these upcoming missions."
s002_10_44,"But as I met with Yuni day after day, I found myself becoming curious."
s002_10_45,I wondered what kind of person Yuni was.
s002_10_46,She was a Nikke in the same squad as yourself. She committed a terrorist act
s002_10_47,and mistakenly shot you in the head when her intended target was Syuen.
s002_10_48,What more is there to know?
s002_10_49,It's just...
s002_10_50,Yuni seems to desperately be trying to tell me something.
s002_10_51,What do you mean?
s002_10_52,"Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo."
s002_10_53,She's always making this sound.
s002_10_54,"Every time she sees me,"
s002_10_55,"she'll look me right in the eyes, and make that sound."
s002_10_56,!!
s002_10_57,"At first, I thought it was just her moaning."
s002_10_58,"But once I looked into her eyes, I knew it was something else."
s002_10_59,She's trying to tell me something.
s002_10_60,...
s002_10_61,She's given me that same intense stare day after day.
s002_10_62,Isn't it natural for me to wonder what she's saying?
s002_10_63,...
s002_10_64,Mana.
s002_10_65,I'm not denying that
s002_10_66,Yuni carried out that attack.
s002_10_67,I know she killed numerous people.
s002_10_68,I know she shot me while attempting to kill Syuen.
s002_10_69,I'm not even asking to be able to communicate back and forth with her.
s002_10_70,I only want to know
s002_10_71,what she's trying to say to me.
s002_10_72,That's all I want to know.
s002_10_73,"That one, desperate sentence."
s002_10_74,Even though she lost her ability to speak
s002_10_75,"after being fused with a Rapture and having her NIMPH reinstalled,"
s002_10_76,"she's still urgently trying to tell me something, and I want to know what it is."
s002_10_77,"Even if everyone else doesn't listen,"
s002_10_78,I feel like I have to.
s002_10_79,I feel like I must hear it.
s002_10_80,...
s002_10_81,Mihara bows to Mana.
s002_10_82,"Just this once, won't you help me?"
s002_10_83,Please.
s002_10_84,You sound like she did...
s002_10_85,*Sigh*
s002_10_86,...
s002_10_87,"Technically speaking, no records pertaining to criminals can be passed on to others."
s002_10_88,We must leave no room for potential bad influences.
s002_10_89,"No matter how many times you ask me, I can't tell you anything."
s002_10_90,... I see.
s002_10_91,However.
s002_10_92,Mana takes out a USB from her pocket.
s002_10_93,"This video, filmed under my supervision,"
s002_10_94,"has been determined to be ""meaningless"" as it contains no information related to the terrorist act."
s002_10_95,"Therefore, I will dispose of it right here and now."
s002_10_96,*Clink*
s002_10_97,Mana throws the USB into the empty trash can.
s002_10_98,!!
s002_10_99,This is just meaningless trash.
s002_10_100,"And given that this is a criminal's living space, not even extraneous trash should be left unattended."
s002_10_101,So.
s002_10_102,You should dispose of it.
s002_10_103,... Mana.
s002_10_104,What are you waiting for? Go take out the trash.
s002_10_105,... Thank you.
s002_10_106,Go quickly.
s002_10_107,... Before I take out the trash myself.
s002_10_108,I will.
s002_10_109,"Thank you, really."
s002_10_110,*Zing*
s002_10_111,Mihara leaves with the USB in hand.
s002_10_112,...
s002_10_113,The sentence she's trying to say...
s002_11_title,WORDLESS: 11
s002_11_1,C-can I say it now?
s002_11_2,Is that what you wanted to say so badly?
s002_11_3,"No, no! I haven't said it yet."
s002_11_4,Then hurry up.
s002_11_5,We need to go soon.
s002_11_6,"Yes, yes! I understand."
s002_11_7,...
s002_11_8,Mihara...
s002_11_9,...
s002_11_10,I...
s002_11_11,Mihara...
s002_11_12,Is that all you have to say?
s002_11_13,No!
s002_11_14,That's not what I want to say.
s002_11_15,I...
s002_11_16,What I want to say is...
s002_11_17,That... uh...
s002_11_18,Sor...
s002_11_19,No.
s002_11_20,If I had to say one sentence...
s002_11_21,Does your...
s002_11_22,Uh...
s002_11_23,...
s002_11_24,*Sigh*
s002_11_25,That's enough. We don't have time for this.
s002_11_26,Wait a moment!
s002_11_27,I understand.
s002_11_28,I...
s002_11_29,I'll say it now.
s002_11_30,You've got one minute.
s002_11_31,Then we need to go.
s002_11_32,I understand.
s002_11_33,"Yuni lowers her head,"
s002_11_34,... Phew.
s002_11_35,then raises it back up and looks hesitantly into the camera.
s002_11_36,... Mihara.
s002_12_title,WORDLESS: 12
s002_12_1,*Creak* *Bang*
s002_12_2,Cooo.
s002_12_3,Yuni raises her head and looks at the door.
s002_12_4,...
s002_12_5,??
s002_12_6,... Yuni.
s002_12_7,Coo?
s002_12_8,*Clack* *Clack*
s002_12_9,Mihara walks towards Yuni.
s002_12_10,Can we talk... one more time?
s002_12_11,Can you tell me that sentence?
s002_12_12,The one you wanted to say to me.
s002_12_13,Can you tell me one more time?
s002_12_14,"Yuni lowers her head,"
s002_12_15,Coo...
s002_12_16,then raises it back up and looks hesitantly at Mihara.
s002_12_17,"... Cooo, co, coo, coo, coo, coo?"
s002_12_18,Mihara. Does your head... still hurt?
s002_12_19,!!
s002_12_20,Oh...
s002_12_21,So... so that was what you wanted to say.
s002_12_22,This was what you wanted to ask me?
s002_12_23,"Coo, coo?"
s002_12_24,That's what
s002_12_25,you've been saying all this time.
s002_12_26,That single question.
s002_12_27,Mihara hugs Yuni tightly.
s002_12_28,Coo...?
s002_12_29,It's okay.
s002_12_30,It doesn't hurt. My head doesn't hurt at all.
s002_12_31,!!
s002_12_32,You don't have to be sorry.
s002_12_33,*Sob* I'm not in pain anymore.
s002_12_34,Coo...
s002_12_35,"Coo, coo, cooooo!"
s002_12_36,Tears start flowing from Yuni's eyes.
s002_12_37,"Coo, coo, cooooo!"
s002_12_38,"Coo, coo, cooooo!"
s002_12_39,Yuni...
s002_12_40,Mihara carefully cups Yuni's cheeks.
s002_12_41,Every time I see you and speak with you...
s002_12_42,My heart aches.
s002_12_43,Cooo?
s002_12_44,This pain in my heart
s002_12_45,tells me that my past self is still alive.
s002_12_46,It tells me that I haven't forgotten my memories with you.
s002_12_47,"So,"
s002_12_48,you didn't kill Mihara.
s002_12_49,I forgive you.
s002_12_50,!!
s002_12_51,Your other crimes are serious.
s002_12_52,"You may never be forgiven for them, no matter what punishment you receive."
s002_12_53,But as for what you did to me... I can forgive you. I will forgive you.
s002_12_54,"Coo, coo, coo..."
s002_12_55,Yuni.
s002_12_56,Seeing me must have been painful for you.
s002_12_57,It must have hurt.
s002_12_58,"Coo, coo!"
s002_12_59,Yes.
s002_12_60,We will feel alive by causing each other pain.
s002_12_61,"Even though we've lost our words and forgotten our memories,"
s002_12_62,"by seeing each other and feeling the pain,"
s002_12_63,we will get through this together and atone for what we did.
s002_13_title,WORDLESS: 13
s002_13_1,*Knock knock*
s002_13_2,Who is it?
s002_13_3,It's Mihara.
s002_13_4,What?
s002_13_5,I have something to tell you.
s002_13_6,!!
s002_13_7,*Zing*
s002_13_8,You?! How did you get in here?
s002_13_9,I wanted to see your face with my own eyes.
s002_13_10,I came here to ask for a favor.
s002_13_11,I don't have time for the likes of you.
s002_13_12,Get out!
s002_13_13,Do you dislike seeing me too?
s002_13_14,"Of course, I do."
s002_13_15,What makes you think you're any different? You're the same as that pathetic heap of junk!
s002_13_16,I shouldn't have created either of you in the first place.
s002_13_17,"If I hadn't, I wouldn't be in this mess. *Sigh*... Argh, my head is killing me!"
s002_13_18,"I thought perhaps the fact I'd taken a bullet for you would warm you up to me somewhat,"
s002_13_19,but apparently I was wrong.
s002_13_20,What is this?
s002_13_21,You want a reward or something?
s002_13_22,If you hadn't swapped senses with me and gotten yourself shot in the head in the first place...
s002_13_23,Ugh...! *Cough*
s002_13_24,Argh! My head!
s002_13_25,"Calm down, Syuen."
s002_13_26,I'm not here to ask for a reward.
s002_13_27,Then what is it?
s002_13_28,Please put a necklace like Yuni's around my neck.
s002_13_29,Necklace?
s002_13_30,You mean that restraining device?
s002_13_31,"Yes, that's right."
s002_13_32,... Did that memory wipe knock a few screws loose or something?
s002_13_33,Do you have any idea what that restraint is?
s002_13_34,I know what it is.
s002_13_35,It's a bomb.
s002_13_36,And you still want it?
s002_13_37,Yes.
s002_13_38,"Can you make it so that if Yuni's bomb goes off, mine does as well?"
s002_13_39,What?
s002_13_40,"Of course, the reverse can also be true. If mine goes off, so will Yuni's."
s002_13_41,Are you crazy?
s002_13_42,I heard they had to reconstruct half your brain because it'd been blown off. Is your mind really that messed up?
s002_13_43,"Haha, it might seem that way."
s002_13_44,But I'm serious.
s002_13_45,This is my last wish.
s002_13_46,"Please, Syuen."
s002_13_47,...
s002_13_48,"Haha, who'd have thought? Such enduring friendship between two rust buckets."
s002_13_49,"You want to die that badly, huh?"
s002_13_50,Fine. Go die with that monster while on a mission.
s002_13_51,It was stupid of me to drag dead weight like you two around.
s002_13_52,I should have turned you into monsters earlier and left you on the surface forever.
s002_13_53,Then I at least could have gotten some use out of you.
s002_13_54,...
s002_13_55,Fine then!
s002_13_56,Put on the bomb necklaces and die together!
s002_13_57,You're nothing but a blemish on my reputation. Trash not even capable of being proper Nikkes.
s002_13_58,Stupid scrap metal!
s002_13_59,How dare you point a gun at me after I imbued you with so many abilities?
s002_13_60,How dare you... I created you...
s002_13_61,*Sob...* *Cough!* *Cough!*
s002_13_62,Syuen.
s002_13_63,*Sigh*... Fine. I'll grant your wish.
s002_13_64,You can fulfill your purpose and die.
s002_13_65,Don't let me see your face ever again.
s002_13_66,Understand?
s002_13_67,... Yes. I won't.
s002_13_68,Now get out.
s002_13_69,I don't want to see you anymore.
s002_13_70,...
s002_13_71,Syuen.
s002_13_72,Didn't you hear me?!
s002_13_73,Syuen makes eye contact with Mihara.
s002_13_74,Thank you for everything.
s002_13_75,!!
s002_13_76,Really.
s002_13_77,Wha...
s002_13_78,Did your memory come back?
s002_13_79,No.
s002_13_80,I don't have my old memories.
s002_13_81,Then what are you thanking me for?
s002_13_82,"I don't know the reason, but when I think about not being able to see you again,"
s002_13_83,I feel a bit sad.
s002_13_84,What?
s002_13_85,"To me, you're not such a bad person."
s002_13_86,...
s002_13_87,"The Wardress Squad may no longer be your pride and joy,"
s002_13_88,"but we will fulfill the mission for which we were born, even if it costs us our lives."
s002_13_89,That is the path Yuni and I must take to atone.
s002_13_90,... Get out.
s002_13_91,Syuen turns her back.
s002_13_92,"Take care, Syuen."
s002_13_93,*Zing*
s002_13_94,Mihara leaves.
s002_13_95,*Sigh*
s002_13_96,Haha.
s002_13_97,"Just because things went wrong once, you think you can tell me what to do?"
s002_13_98,Thank you for everything?
s002_13_99,You don't even have any memories.
s002_13_100,Talking about feelings without memories...!
s002_13_101,Scrap metal...
s002_13_102,Scrap metal...
s002_13_103,You think anything will change if you're gone?
s002_13_104,I don't need refuse like you around.
s002_13_105,I said I don't need you!
s002_13_106,I...!
s002_13_107,I...
s002_13_108,...
s002_13_109,Syuen looks back.
s002_13_110,...
s002_13_111,No one is there.
s002_13_112,...
s002_13_113,It's nothing.
s002_13_114,Just no good scrap.
s002_13_115,It left just like I told it to.
s002_13_116,That's all... that's all...
s002_13_117,Oh.
s002_13_118,My head hurts.
s002_13_119,"Oh, it hurts..."
s002_13_120,...
s002_13_121,It hurts...
s002_14_title,WORDLESS: Epilogue
s002_14_2,Mihara.
s002_14_3,Yes?
s002_14_4,Open your eyes.
s002_14_5,Can you see clearly?
s002_14_6,"Yes, I can."
s002_14_7,Who am I?
s002_14_8,Someone I'm grateful to know.
s002_14_9,Answer properly.
s002_14_10,"Haha, Mana."
s002_14_11,"Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are all normal?"
s002_14_12,"Yes, everything is normal."
s002_14_13,"Okay, no issues. Come down."
s002_14_14,Mihara steps off the examination table.
s002_14_15,"We installed the restraining necklace you requested,"
s002_14_16,and swapped your body for another.
s002_14_17,No wonder I feel different.
s002_14_18,"It wasn't the necklace, but the body replacement."
s002_14_19,What's the reason for the swap?
s002_14_20,It was requested by Syuen.
s002_14_21,"She said she had no use for it, so you could have it."
s002_14_22,Where did it come from?
s002_14_23,It was a body prepared to replace yours after your first mission.
s002_14_24,"After taking promotional photos with you,"
s002_14_25,Syuen wanted to make you look stronger.
s002_14_26,She planned to use this body when announcing Project Wardress.
s002_14_27,"But since we failed to take down Chatterbox,"
s002_14_28,"there never was a public announcement,"
s002_14_29,rendering this body useless...
s002_14_30,That's right.
s002_14_31,...
s002_14_32,...
s002_14_33,"It may be later than intended, but I'll still make good use of it."
s002_14_34,Tell Syuen I said thank you.
s002_14_35,I will.
s002_14_36,One last thing.
s002_14_37,"The necklace you're wearing must be swapped periodically for a new one, just like Yuni's."
s002_14_38,Don't forget to come along with Yuni regularly to get a new one installed.
s002_14_39,"As per your request, if either of you misses the deadline to have a new one installed, both will explode."
s002_14_40,"Hehe, living a life with bombs around our necks..."
s002_14_41,Sounds kinda thrilling.
s002_14_42,...
s002_14_43,"Haha, just kidding."
s002_14_44,I'll come on time.
s002_14_45,I intend to live well and long with Yuni
s002_14_46,so that she can atone for her sins.
s002_14_47,... May I ask you one thing?
s002_14_48,Sure.
s002_14_49,Why are you doing all this?
s002_14_50,"I knew you had a deep bond,"
s002_14_51,but I still don't understand this.
s002_14_52,Do you mean this necklace?
s002_14_53,Yes.
s002_14_54,I don't understand this compulsion to die together.
s002_14_55,Why are you going through all this for someone who shot you in the head?
s002_14_56,Because...
s002_14_57,Because I heard that desperate plea.
s002_14_58,A poor child who is unable to get along with others
s002_14_59,was desperately begging for my forgiveness.
s002_14_60,"If she's to spend her life begging for forgiveness, I don't want her doing it alone."
s002_14_61,That's all.
s002_14_62,... I see.
s002_14_63,Thank you for your answer.
s002_14_64,Thank you for listening to me.
s002_14_65,"See you next time, Mana."
s002_14_66,Yes. Take care.
s002_14_67,"Yuni, look ahead."
s002_14_68,??
s002_14_69,It's the surface.
s002_14_70,"It's my first time, but it's also been a long time for you, right?"
s002_14_71,??
s002_14_72,Don't you remember?
s002_14_73,Coo... coo?
s002_14_74,Yuni tilts her head.
s002_14_75,"Haha, your memory seems a bit foggy?"
s002_14_76,...
s002_14_77,Yuni stares blankly at the ground underneath her.
s002_14_78,"Yuni, it's the surface."
s002_14_79,This is where we prove ourselves.
s002_14_80,Let's take down Chatterbox and make Syuen happy.
s002_14_81,Yuni?
s002_14_82,Coo?
s002_14_83,Are you okay?
s002_14_84,Coo.
s002_14_85,"It's all a bit intimidating, isn't it?"
s002_14_86,...
s002_14_87,It's okay. I'll always be by your side.
s002_14_88,Coo!
s002_14_89,Finding a rare Rapture within a month.
s002_14_90,That will be our first goal.
s002_14_91,Coo.
s002_14_92,Shall we?
s002_14_93,Coo!
s002_14_94,Yuni and Mihara walk forward.
s002_14_95,"Although they walk in matching steps like before,"
s002_14_96,"this time, it is different from before."

s003_01_1,It's been a while since I've been left alone.
s003_01_2,...
s003_01_3,I don't like being alone.
s003_01_4,Should I have gone with Behemoth?
s003_01_5,"Nah, it's fine."
s003_01_6,We all promised to work hard.
s003_01_7,I've got to grin and bear it.
s003_01_8,*Swooosh*
s003_01_9,??
s003_01_10,Are those waves?
s003_01_11,"Oh right, there was an ocean nearby."
s003_01_12,...
s003_01_13,The sea...
s003_01_14,We met at the sea.
s003_01_15,Leviathan listens to the sound of the waves and recalls past memories.
s003_01_16,*Splash*!
s003_01_17,Her body slowly sinks deeper.
s003_01_18,"Surrounded by the frigid waters, she can feel herself beginning to suffocate."
s003_01_19,"Suddenly, her survival instincts kick in,"
s003_01_20,and her special power wraps itself around her.
s003_01_21,*Blurb blurb*
s003_01_22,Her breathing stabilizes.
s003_01_23,"Encased by a layer of bubbles, Little Mermaid opens her eyes."
s003_01_24,"Beyond the bubbles, a familiar oceanic landscape appears."
s003_01_25,"In this cold open sea, she has survived once again."
s003_01_26,The sea again...
s003_01_27,"After plummeting from space, she spent the next several years roaming the surface,"
s003_01_28,desperately searching for her comrades.
s003_01_29,"And now, here she was, sinking into the depths of the sea yet again."
s003_01_30,"Once again, her body was battered and scarred."
s003_01_31,Cinderella... Abe....
s003_01_32,Hansel...
s003_01_33,... Gretel.
s003_01_34,"Despite all those years spent wandering the surface,"
s003_01_35,she has yet to find her lost comrades.
s003_01_36,"She must rise again, and find those whom she misses so dearly."
s003_01_37,"She must resurface, and use this foam to create bubbles."
s003_01_38,"This time, she must find proof that they're still alive."
s003_01_39,"In order to rise above the water's surface, she lifts her body."
s003_01_40,Hrngh...
s003_01_41,Her body is practically immobile.
s003_01_42,"The physical and mental toil of the past few years has taken its toll on her,"
s003_01_43,making her body feel heavier than ever.
s003_01_44,*Rumble*
s003_01_45,The sea currents begin to stir.
s003_01_46,The bubbles encasing her are swept away by the currents and drift off somewhere unknown.
s003_01_47,She closes her eyes again.
s003_01_48,"She stops struggling and lets go, entrusting her body to the flow of the sea."
s003_01_49,"For a little while,"
s003_01_50,"just for a moment, she wants to let her weary body rest in the water."
s003_01_51,*Swooosh*
s003_01_52,Wh... what is that?
s003_01_53,A human? A Nikke?
s003_01_54,A girl covered in black water discovers someone who has been carried by the waves and washed ashore.
s003_01_55,Huh?
s003_01_56,Urgh...
s003_01_57,*Gasp*!
s003_01_58,The girl quickly stumbles backward.
s003_01_59,S-she's alive?!
s003_01_60,...
s003_01_61,...
s003_01_62,Is she unconscious?
s003_01_63,...
s003_01_64,Whew... that really gave me a scare.
s003_01_65,"I think she's a Nikke, but..."
s003_01_66,"I should save her, right?"
s003_01_67,...
s003_01_68,"Wait, what am I thinking?"
s003_01_69,Who could I possibly save in this state?
s003_01_70,"Even if I did, nothing good would come of it."
s003_01_71,... Forget it.
s003_01_72,I didn't see anything.
s003_01_73,...
s003_01_74,I...
s003_01_75,I didn't see anything!
s003_01_76,*Cough*
s003_01_77,!!
s003_01_78,Little Mermaid opens her eyes.
s003_01_79,A-are you awake?
s003_01_80,Cinder... ella...
s003_01_81,Abe...
s003_01_82,I'm cold...
s003_01_83,"Little Mermaid closes her eyes, seemingly fainting once again."
s003_01_84,Huh?
s003_01_85,...
s003_01_86,You're starting to freak me out...
s003_01_87,I... miss you all...
s003_01_88,Tears stream down from behind Little Mermaid's closed eyelids.
s003_01_89,!!
s003_01_90,...
s003_01_91,Why are you crying?
s003_01_92,This is really unnerving...
s003_01_93,...
s003_01_94,"Aw, to heck with it!"
s003_01_95,The girl tugs Little Mermaid away from the shoreline.
s003_01_96,Today's your lucky day!
s003_02_title,MUDFISH: 2
s003_02_1,*Drip drip drip drip*
s003_02_2,The sound of water droplets falling.
s003_02_3,How....
s003_02_4,Someone's voice can be heard.
s003_02_5,"*Sigh*... I couldn't just leave her like that... Dang it, why did I bring her?"
s003_02_6,This is followed by the sound
s003_02_7,of what appears to be grumbling.
s003_02_8,!!
s003_02_9,Little Mermaid opens her eyes.
s003_02_10,"She's been covered with a blanket,"
s003_02_11,and is inside some kind of cave which is being lit by a small lantern.
s003_02_12,What the...
s003_02_13,Oh! Are you awake?
s003_02_14,*Crashhh*
s003_02_15,?!
s003_02_16,Little Mermaid looks towards the noise.
s003_02_17,Who's there?
s003_02_18,Ouch...
s003_02_19,Is someone there?
s003_02_20,Little Mermaid gets up.
s003_02_21,S-stop!
s003_02_22,??
s003_02_23,D-don't come this way!
s003_02_24,Stay right where you are!
s003_02_25,Little Mermaid stops.
s003_02_26,...
s003_02_27,That's better! Don't move a muscle!
s003_02_28,Who are you?
s003_02_29,What business is it of yours?!
s003_02_30,Did you save me?
s003_02_31,Yeah.
s003_02_32,I want to see who you are.
s003_02_33,What reason would you possibly have for seeing my face?
s003_02_34,"Now that you've come to, you can get out!"
s003_02_35,But...
s003_02_36,"No! No ifs, ands, or buts!"
s003_02_37,... Do you know who I am?
s003_02_38,The girl reveals her face.
s003_02_39,!!
s003_02_40,She has red eyes.
s003_02_41,Those eyes...!
s003_02_42,Do you realize what these eyes mean?
s003_02_43,It's proof that I'm a Heretic.
s003_02_44,Heretic...
s003_02_45,Do you know what that is?
s003_02_46,It means I'm something to be feared. The enemy of all humanity. Nikkes don't stand a chance against me!
s003_02_47,...
s003_02_48,So don't come near m...
s003_02_49,*Swoosh*
s003_02_50,A purple blur flashes by the girl's cheek.
s003_02_51,!!!
s003_02_52,*Bang*
s003_02_53,Wh-what was that?
s003_02_54,The girl turns around.
s003_02_55,"A section of the wall has been caved in, looking as if a bomb has gone off."
s003_02_56,D-did you just try to attack me?
s003_02_57,...
s003_02_58,"Dozens of tiny water droplets appear around Little Mermaid, all aimed at the girl."
s003_02_59,Gah! Time to run!
s003_02_60,Stop.
s003_02_61,!!
s003_02_62,"The girl's body remains motionless, as if frozen in ice."
s003_02_63,I... I can't move!
s003_02_64,...
s003_02_65,Little Mermaid approaches the girl.
s003_02_66,No! Stay back!
s003_02_67,Tell me.
s003_02_68,Are you really a Heretic?
s003_02_69,I... I...
s003_02_70,Answer me.
s003_02_71,N-no!
s003_02_72,It was a lie.
s003_02_73,I'm not a Heretic.
s003_02_74,Then how do you explain those eyes?
s003_02_75,Th-these are just...
s003_02_76,"The girl blinks, and when she reopens her eyes..."
s003_02_77,!!
s003_02_78,They're a different color.
s003_02_79,Your eye color... It changed?
s003_02_80,All that stuff before was just a part of my disguise.
s003_02_81,Don't lie to me. I've never heard of a Nikke that can change eye colors.
s003_02_82,It's true!
s003_02_83,Really!
s003_02_84,"Then if you're not a Nikke, what are you?"
s003_02_85,... I don't know.
s003_02_86,What?
s003_02_87,I said I don't know!
s003_02_88,"I'm as in the dark as you are, you jerk!"
s003_02_89,I was... *Sob*... I was once a Nikke...
s003_02_90,You think this is how I wanted things to go?
s003_02_91,I... I...
s003_02_92,I never wanted to end up like this!
s003_02_93,"If I hadn't accidentally drank that water, I wouldn't be living in this cave."
s003_02_94,I could have gone back to the Ark instead!
s003_02_95,...
s003_02_96,Why do I have to live like this?
s003_02_97,Why is it just me?
s003_02_98,*Sob*
s003_02_99,"Oh, sorry! You should be able to move again."
s003_02_100,*Thud*
s003_02_101,The girl plops on the ground.
s003_02_102,Sorry about that...
s003_02_103,Little Mermaid offers the girl her hand.
s003_02_104,!!
s003_02_105,The girl scurries along the ground and hides deeper in the recesses of the cave.
s003_02_106,!!
s003_02_107,I promise I'll never do the thing with the red eyes again!
s003_02_108,I was just trying to help! I didn't do anything bad!
s003_02_109,I'm not a Heretic or anything like that!
s003_02_110,"So please, don't kill me!"
s003_02_111,Ha...
s003_02_112,...
s003_02_113,You poor thing.
s003_03_title,MUDFISH: 3
s003_03_1,...
s003_03_2,...
s003_03_3,Little Mermaid glances deep inside the cave where the girl is hiding.
s003_03_4,...
s003_03_5,"Beyond the lantern's reach, cloaked in deep shadow,"
s003_03_6,"the girl lies curled up in a ball, her head buried in between her knees."
s003_03_7,... Hey.
s003_03_8,...
s003_03_9,Aren't you cold?
s003_03_10,...
s003_03_11,Would you like this blanket?
s003_03_12,Gah!
s003_03_13,Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you...
s003_03_14,What's the proper way to handle this...?
s003_03_15,Little Mermaid recalls one of the halcyon days of her past.
s003_03_16,Siren?
s003_03_17,Huh?
s003_03_18,What are you doing here?
s003_03_19,... Ooh ooh.
s003_03_20,"How come you're sitting here alone, looking all miserable?"
s003_03_21,Ah ooh.
s003_03_22,Did you do something wrong?
s003_03_23,Little Mermaid nods.
s003_03_24,What did you do wrong?
s003_03_25,Hansel. Gretel.
s003_03_26,Did you hit them?
s003_03_27,Little Mermaid shakes her head.
s003_03_28,You didn't hit them?
s003_03_29,Then what did you do?
s003_03_30,Did you use one of your command spells?
s003_03_31,!!
s003_03_32,*Nod*
s003_03_33,You did? Seriously?
s003_03_34,It was an accident.
s003_03_35,What did you say?
s003_03_36,Ahugh...
s003_03_37,"It's okay, just tell me."
s003_03_38,"I said, ""Don't move""."
s003_03_39,...
s003_03_40,What made you do that?
s003_03_41,You wouldn't have used that spell unless there was a good reason.
s003_03_42,"They were tickling me relentlessly, and I wanted them to stop."
s003_03_43,"Ugh, those two are incorrigible."
s003_03_44,"After I used my spell, they got scared."
s003_03_45,Now they're hiding from me and won't come out.
s003_03_46,They've got some nerve acting like that when they're the ones who bothered you first!
s003_03_47,*Sigh*...
s003_03_48,...
s003_03_49,...
s003_03_50,"If it's weighing on your mind so much, why don't you bring them something they like to eat?"
s003_03_51,Oh?
s003_03_52,"If you want to bury the hatchet, the first step is to extend an olive branch... and not just metaphorically."
s003_03_53,People's hearts tend to soften on a full stomach.
s003_03_54,"First try giving them something they like to eat,"
s003_03_55,and then apologize to them.
s003_03_56,But will they accept my apology?
s003_03_57,"If I told you they wouldn't, would you not bother apologizing?"
s003_03_58,That's not what I meant.
s003_03_59,An apology is about showing someone that you're sorry.
s003_03_60,Whether they choose to accept it or not is of little consequence.
s003_03_61,"If you come to someone, heart in hand, and they still spurn you, then there's nothing else you can do."
s003_03_62,Oohugh.
s003_03_63,"Oh, and if they try tickling you again, don't use your commands."
s003_03_64,"Instead, just blast them with some bubbles."
s003_03_65,Got it?
s003_03_66,But wouldn't they get injured?
s003_03_67,"At any rate, just go apologize."
s003_03_68,Ooh!
s003_03_69,Something to eat...
s003_03_70,...
s003_03_71,Little Mermaid stands up.
s003_03_72,!!
s003_03_73,She heads outside.
s003_03_74,...
s003_03_75,Did she leave?
s003_03_76,Hello?
s003_03_77,Silence.
s003_03_78,The girl cautiously creeps over to where Little Mermaid had been standing.
s003_03_79,She's gone...
s003_03_80,Hehe... She's gone. She's finally gone!
s003_03_81,Phew...
s003_03_82,The girl sits on the ground.
s003_03_83,I nearly bought the farm back there.
s003_03_84,"I thought she was an ordinary Nikke, and turns out she's some kind of superweapon!"
s003_03_85,I figured she'd run off if I said I was a Heretic.
s003_03_86,Just goes to show that you shouldn't go out of your way for people.
s003_03_87,She reminded me of myself. No one there to help her...
s003_03_88,But now I'm starting to regret that...
s003_03_89,The girl looks at the spot where Little Mermaid had been sitting.
s003_03_90,...
s003_03_91,"I didn't necessarily expect gratitude, but..."
s003_03_92,I at least thought I'd be able to talk to someone again. It's been ages since I had a proper conversation.
s003_03_93,Story of my life.
s003_03_94,Nothing but rotten luck.
s003_03_95,The girl hugs her knees and curls back up.
s003_03_96,Never again.
s003_03_97,Never again will I save a human or anyone.
s003_03_98,I'll never set myself up to be betrayed again.
s003_04_title,MUDFISH: 4
s003_04_1,*Growl*
s003_04_2,"Oh boy, I'm starving."
s003_04_3,I forgot to eat with all this excitement.
s003_04_4,I think I've still got some of that Splendamin I found before...
s003_04_5,Ugh!
s003_04_6,!!
s003_04_7,Gaaaah!
s003_04_8,Gaaaah!
s003_04_9,*Crash*
s003_04_10,The girl hurriedly scurries back inside the cave.
s003_04_11,What the...?!
s003_04_12,I thought you'd left!
s003_04_13,Ooh... Ooohh....
s003_04_14,Little Mermaid lingers awkwardly at the cave entrance.
s003_04_15,Why aren't you answering?
s003_04_16,Wh-what are you gonna do to me?!
s003_04_17,Uh... Uhh... Hm...
s003_04_18,Hm...
s003_04_19,Oh!
s003_04_20,Little Mermaid reaches out her hand.
s003_04_21,What are you doing?!
s003_04_22,*Plop*
s003_04_23,A droplet of something falls from the tip of Little Mermaid's hand.
s003_04_24,What is that? Jelly?
s003_04_25,"The purplish droplet lands on the ground, and then moves toward the girl."
s003_04_26,Do-don't come near me!
s003_04_27,The droplet stops directly in front of the girl.
s003_04_28,??
s003_04_29,She covers her head in fear and shrinks back.
s003_04_30,*Wobble wobble*
s003_04_31,...?
s003_04_32,Wha...
s003_04_33,*Wobble wobble*
s003_04_34,It's... not doing anything.
s003_04_35,*Wobble wobble*
s003_04_36,Why is it jiggling like that?
s003_04_37,The girl pokes the droplet.
s003_04_38,*Wobble wobble wobble*
s003_04_39,...!
s003_04_40,The texture...
s003_04_41,*Poke poke*
s003_04_42,*Wobble wobble wobble*
s003_04_43,...
s003_04_44,*Poke poke poke*
s003_04_45,*Wobble wobble wobble*
s003_04_46,Hehe... It's kinda cute.
s003_04_47,?!
s003_04_48,H-hold on! Who cares?! What are you trying to do with this?
s003_04_49,Ooh uh ooh!
s003_04_50,A little arrow appears above the droplet.
s003_04_51,An arrow?
s003_04_52,The arrow points outside the cave.
s003_04_53,You want me to come outside?
s003_04_54,The droplet bobs up and down.
s003_04_55,... Is that supposed to be a nod?
s003_04_56,Ah ooh!
s003_04_57,Little Mermaid nods.
s003_04_58,So you do want me to come outside?
s003_04_59,Ooh!
s003_04_60,*Bounce bounce*
s003_04_61,The droplet wobbles up and down eagerly.
s003_04_62,...
s003_04_63,*Bounce bounce bounce*
s003_04_64,No way! I'm not going anywhere.
s003_04_65,How do I know what'll happen to me?
s003_04_66,The droplet wilts pathetically.
s003_04_67,Don't try and act cute! It won't affect me! I'm not coming!
s003_04_68,Ah uh....
s003_04_69,*Slurp*
s003_04_70,"The droplet melts into a puddle, which begins to expand."
s003_04_71,Huh? What's going on?
s003_04_72,*Slurp*
s003_04_73,Ooh uh....
s003_04_74,"Okay, okay! Fine."
s003_04_75,"I'll come out, but you go first."
s003_04_76,Ooh uh?
s003_04_77,Go on! I'll follow you.
s003_04_78,Ooh!
s003_04_79,Why did you have me come outside anyway?
s003_04_80,Ooh!
s003_04_81,Little Mermaid points ahead.
s003_04_82,Huh?
s003_04_83,The girl looks ahead.
s003_04_84,What is it?
s003_04_85,"Up ahead, a bonfire flickers on the beach."
s003_04_86,What?! Are you crazy?!
s003_04_87,What are you going to do if a Rapture sees that?
s003_04_88,Ooh... Ooh uh!
s003_04_89,Little Mermaid punches the air.
s003_04_90,You'll take them out yourself?
s003_04_91,Ah uh!
s003_04_92,Wow. Impressive.
s003_04_93,*Plop*
s003_04_94,Little Mermaid sits down in front of the bonfire.
s003_04_95,Ooh uh!
s003_04_96,She gestures towards the girl.
s003_04_97,Er... no thanks. I'd rather not.
s003_04_98,Ooh...
s003_04_99,Just be glad that I decided to come out in the first place!
s003_04_100,Ooh uh....
s003_04_101,...
s003_04_102,Little Mermaid picks up a grilled fish that had apparently been placed near the fire earlier.
s003_04_103,Ooh!
s003_04_104,Hmm? What's that?
s003_04_105,Ooh?
s003_04_106,Nom nom.
s003_04_107,You want me to eat this?
s003_04_108,Ooh!
s003_04_109,Not a chance. How can I trust you?
s003_04_110,"Sure, I may be famished right now, but I'll just..."
s003_04_111,*Growl*
s003_04_112,!!!
s003_04_113,Oooh?
s003_04_114,"Dang it, you're the reason I wasn't able to eat to begin with!"
s003_04_115,Oh...
s003_04_116,Sorry.
s003_04_117,What?
s003_04_118,I'm sorry for scaring you.
s003_04_119,That was my fault.
s003_04_120,What the...
s003_04_121,You had me convinced that you were really a Heretic.
s003_04_122,"But, now I can see that you're a Nikke."
s003_04_123,...
s003_04_124,I promise.
s003_04_125,I won't ever try to harm you again.
s003_04_126,Thank you for saving me.
s003_04_127,...
s003_04_128,Do you really mean that?
s003_04_129,Ooh?
s003_04_130,That you're sorry? And... that you're thankful?
s003_04_131,Ooh uh!
s003_04_132,That you won't ever harm me?
s003_04_133,I meant every word.
s003_04_134,...
s003_04_135,Fine.
s003_04_136,I'll trust you... just this once.
s003_04_137,The girl heads towards Little Mermaid and the bonfire.
s003_04_138,*Plop*
s003_04_139,!!
s003_04_140,... Give me some of that. I want to try.
s003_04_141,Ooh!!
s003_04_142,Little Mermaid smiles brightly as she passes the grilled fish.
s003_04_143,...
s003_04_144,You're really pretty.
s003_04_145,Ooh?
s003_04_146,No-nothing!
s003_04_147,The girl picks up the grilled fish.
s003_04_148,... Thanks.
s003_04_149,Ooh!
s003_04_150,*Nom*
s003_04_151,!!
s003_04_152,It's delicious!
s003_04_153,I can't believe you found something this good on the surface!
s003_04_154,Ah uh!
s003_04_155,Little Mermaid hands over another grilled fish.
s003_04_156,I can have that as well?
s003_04_157,Ooh uh!
s003_04_158,Little Mermaid points at the remaining fish near the bonfire.
s003_04_159,I can have all of those?
s003_04_160,Ooh!
s003_04_161,Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all...
s003_04_162,Ooh?
s003_04_163,Er... nothing. So it's really okay if I chow down on all of this?
s003_04_164,Ah uh!
s003_05_title,MUDFISH: 5
s003_05_1,"Oof, I'm stuffed..."
s003_05_2,It's been ages since I've been this full.
s003_05_3,Ah uh!
s003_05_4,"Mmm, that was a real feast."
s003_05_5,Hehe.
s003_05_6,"So... you're a Nikke, right?"
s003_05_7,Ooh!
s003_05_8,Then what squad are you from?
s003_05_9,When did you leave the Ark?
s003_05_10,Ooh uh?
s003_05_11,"If it's classified, you don't have to tell m..."
s003_05_12,"I don't know what this ""Ark"" is that you're talking about."
s003_05_13,What? You don't know what the Ark is? That doesn't make any sense.
s003_05_14,Then are you a Pilgrim or something like that?
s003_05_15,Uh ah uh?
s003_05_16,Don't tell me you don't know what a Pilgrim is either?
s003_05_17,Ooh!
s003_05_18,"Wow, you really don't know anything."
s003_05_19,Hold on... Did you ingest some black water too?
s003_05_20,Could that have caused you to lose all your memories?
s003_05_21,Ooh?
s003_05_22,The black water. It's like this stuff that's always coming from my head.
s003_05_23,"If you accidently drink some, it feels like your entire body is being torn apart."
s003_05_24,Ooh uh....
s003_05_25,Little Mermaid shakes her head.
s003_05_26,"... Yeah, there's no way that could have happened..."
s003_05_27,...
s003_05_28,So what's your name?
s003_05_29,Siren.
s003_05_30,Siren?
s003_05_31,Ah uh!
s003_05_32,Siren...
s003_05_33,That's a nice name.
s003_05_34,Ooh uh?
s003_05_35,Little Mermaid points at the girl.
s003_05_36,What's my name?
s003_05_37,Ooh!
s003_05_38,I... I don't have a name.
s003_05_39,I forgot it the moment I was changed into whatever I am now.
s003_05_40,Oh...
s003_05_41,You don't have to feel bad for me.
s003_05_42,"Actually, now that I think about it, there is something you could call me."
s003_05_43,This.
s003_05_44,The girl holds out a dog tag covered in black stains.
s003_05_45,The inscription reads LEV-20765.
s003_05_46,... Ah.
s003_05_47,"Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it?"
s003_05_48,You can just call me whatever.
s003_05_49,"Dude or ""Girl"", it doesn't matter."
s003_05_50,...
s003_05_51,Levi.
s003_05_52,What?
s003_05_53,Little Mermaid points at the beginning of the inscription.
s003_05_54,LEV.
s003_05_55,Is that how you got Levi?
s003_05_56,Ah uh!
s003_05_57,Why do you care so much about giving me a name?
s003_05_58,Not a name.
s003_05_59,Huh?
s003_05_60,Little Mermaid smiles.
s003_05_61,A nickname. I have a nickname too: Siren.
s003_05_62,My real name is Little Mermaid.
s003_05_63,Little Mermaid...
s003_05_64,A nickname is a sign of affection.
s003_05_65,I don't need to know your name.
s003_05_66,"Okay, fine, but..."
s003_05_67,The girl looks down at her dog tag.
s003_05_68,Nickname...
s003_05_69,It kinda feels like you pulled it out of a hat.
s003_05_70,Ooh?
s003_05_71,Never mind. I guess it's not all that bad.
s003_05_72,You can call me that from now on.
s003_05_73,Ah uh!
s003_05_74,So what's your next move?
s003_05_75,Ooh?
s003_05_76,You must have someplace that you call home.
s003_05_77,A place you can go back to.
s003_05_78,"You don't plan on staying here forever, do you?"
s003_05_79,...
s003_05_80,I don't have a home.
s003_05_81,What?
s003_05_82,I lost my home. So I need to find my friends.
s003_05_83,It... it's the same for me too.
s003_05_84,I lost my home.
s003_05_85,Ooh?
s003_05_86,I don't have anywhere to go back to... not since my body became like this.
s003_05_87,Ooh...?!
s003_05_88,What's that supposed to mean?
s003_05_89,There's something wrong with me. Weird black liquid keeps seeping out of my body.
s003_05_90,I look like a monster.
s003_05_91,Who would want to associate with someone who looks like me?
s003_05_92,...
s003_05_93,But I'm not a monster! I'm a Nikke!
s003_05_94,That's right.
s003_05_95,You're not a monster.
s003_05_96,I can tell by your eyes.
s003_05_97,You mean because I don't have red eyes?
s003_05_98,*Shake shake*
s003_05_99,"No, I can tell by looking into your eyes."
s003_05_100,You're not a bad person.
s003_05_101,You're no monster.
s003_05_102,Do you really mean that?
s003_05_103,Ooh uh!
s003_05_104,...
s003_05_105,Then... could you stay with me?
s003_05_106,Ooh?
s003_05_107,If you don't have anything to go back to... would you like to stay with me?
s003_05_108,"It's a big cave, so there's plenty of room for us both..."
s003_05_109,and I'll give you a blanket!
s003_05_110,"... I'm sorry, but I can't."
s003_05_111,"Oh... okay. I understand. Only a moment ago I was going on about how scary you were, and now I'm begging you to stay. Must be pretty off-putting, huh?"
s003_05_112,*Shake shake*
s003_05_113,It's not that. I'm looking for my friends.
s003_05_114,That's why I can't stay.
s003_05_115,Your friends...
s003_05_116,Okay... then I guess that's it.
s003_05_117,"Friends are important... so go, then. Hurry."
s003_05_118,Levi's shoulders slump.
s003_05_119,...
s003_05_120,One month.
s003_05_121,Can I stay with you for just one month?
s003_05_122,One month?
s003_05_123,*Nod*
s003_05_124,Why are you saying that?
s003_05_125,Is it because...
s003_05_126,you're taking pity on me?
s003_05_127,I want to rest for a while.
s003_05_128,"If you're okay with it, can I rest here for a little bit?"
s003_05_129,It... It's fine by me.
s003_05_130,But are you sure you're okay with this?
s003_05_131,You don't mind being around me?
s003_05_132,Ooh uh!
s003_05_133,... Fine.
s003_05_134,We can stay together for now.
s003_06_title,MUDFISH: 6
s003_06_1,"After that day, the two Nikkes began living together."
s003_06_2,"Here, Siren."
s003_06_3,Ooh uh?
s003_06_4,*Plop*
s003_06_5,Levi piles up several blankets on the floor of the cave.
s003_06_6,You can sleep here.
s003_06_7,Ooh!
s003_06_8,Little Mermaid sits down on the blankets.
s003_06_9,Well... good night.
s003_06_10,Levi lies down directly on the ground.
s003_06_11,... Ooh uh?
s003_06_12,What's wrong?
s003_06_13,"Is it too hard when you lie down? Well, this is a cave and all, so no matter how many blankets I put dow..."
s003_06_14,What about you?
s003_06_15,Me?
s003_06_16,*Nod*
s003_06_17,I'm fine sleeping here.
s003_06_18,Why?
s003_06_19,What do you mean?
s003_06_20,"It'd be uncomfortable for you if I slept next to you, and I'd get this black liquid all over the blankets."
s003_06_21,...
s003_06_22,Don't worry. I haven't used any of those blankets I just gave you.
s003_06_23,They shouldn't have any stains on them.
s003_06_24,*Shake shake*
s003_06_25,What are you shaking your head for?
s003_06_26,Let's use it together.
s003_06_27,Absolutely not! You just use it yourself!
s003_06_28,I'm perfectly comfortable where I am.
s003_06_29,Ooh uh....
s003_06_30,Ooh!
s003_06_31,Little Mermaid raises her hand.
s003_06_32,Huh?!
s003_06_33,"Bubbles balloon up from the tips of Little Mermaid's fingers, and expand into a large rectangular shape."
s003_06_34,What is that?
s003_06_35,A bed.
s003_06_36,For who?
s003_06_37,You.
s003_06_38,Are you serious?
s003_06_39,Ooh!
s003_06_40,But what about you?
s003_06_41,Little Mermaid lays on top of the blanket.
s003_06_42,Ooh!
s003_06_43,"No, you go ahead and keep that. I don't need i..."
s003_06_44,*Shake shake*
s003_06_45,"Good night, Levi."
s003_06_46,Little Mermaid closes her eyes.
s003_06_47,What the... You create a bed out of nowhere and then just zonk out?
s003_06_48,How do you expect me to sleep on this thing?
s003_06_49,Levi presses down on the bed with her hands.
s003_06_50,*Squish*
s003_06_51,"Actually, it feels pretty good..."
s003_06_52,...
s003_06_53,"Ah, screw it."
s003_06_54,Levi climbs onto the bubble bed.
s003_06_55,A feeling of warmth spreads through her body.
s003_06_56,"Wow, it's warm!"
s003_06_57,Levi gingerly lays down on the bed.
s003_06_58,Feels like I'm sitting on a cloud... It's nice.
s003_06_59,Hehe.
s003_06_60,... Thanks.
s003_06_61,"... Good night, Siren."
s003_06_62,Ah uh!
s003_06_63,"Here, have some of this."
s003_06_64,Levi hands over a can and spoon.
s003_06_65,Ooh uh?
s003_06_66,I picked it up when I went to the abandoned house for blankets.
s003_06_67,"I haven't had it for too long, so it should still be good."
s003_06_68,... Probably.
s003_06_69,What about you?
s003_06_70,I'm not hung...
s003_06_71,*Growl*
s003_06_72,!!
s003_06_73,"Er, that was just..."
s003_06_74,...
s003_06_75,That's the only can left.
s003_06_76,Just eat it.
s003_06_77,Ooh uh...!
s003_06_78,Little Mermaid stands up.
s003_06_79,Fish.
s003_06_80,Huh?
s003_06_81,"You're not planning on going fishing right now, are you?"
s003_06_82,Ah uh!
s003_06_83,Little Mermaid heads outside.
s003_06_84,Wait! I'll go with you!
s003_06_85,*Sizzle sizzle*
s003_06_86,I didn't expect I'd have a chance to eat this again so soon.
s003_06_87,Ooh!
s003_06_88,Levi takes a big bite of the grilled fish.
s003_06_89,It's delicious.
s003_06_90,Hehe.
s003_06_91,Uh... I have a question.
s003_06_92,"You spoke perfectly fine at first, so why are you only grunting and moaning now?"
s003_06_93,!!
s003_06_94,Do you not want to talk to me?
s003_06_95,*Shake shake*
s003_06_96,No? Then why...
s003_06_97,"If I misspeak, my Kotodama can activate."
s003_06_98,Kotodama?
s003_06_99,You mean like how you made me stop moving before?
s003_06_100,... Ooh.
s003_06_101,That wasn't intentional?
s003_06_102,Ah ooh.
s003_06_103,So you're refraining from speaking so that you don't accidentally set off those commands?
s003_06_104,*Nod*
s003_06_105,I see...
s003_06_106,...
s003_06_107,What a pain.
s003_06_108,Ooh?
s003_06_109,"Even if you desperately want to say something, you have to hold it in. Must be tough."
s003_06_110,... Ooh uh.
s003_06_111,...
s003_06_112,...
s003_06_113,"Ah, to hell with it."
s003_06_114,Just talk.
s003_06_115,Ah uh?
s003_06_116,Go ahead. I'm okay with it.
s003_06_117,I'm not scared anymore.
s003_06_118,Are you sure you're not scared?
s003_06_119,"Nope, not a bit."
s003_06_120,So I can talk? Really?
s003_06_121,How long are you going to make me keep repeating myself?
s003_06_122,"It's irritating hearing nothing but monosyllabic grunts all the time, so just talk normal."
s003_06_123,It feels better that way.
s003_06_124,"... Thank you, Levi."
s003_06_125,Gah!
s003_06_126,Levi's fishing rod bends down sharply.
s003_06_127,What do I do now?!
s003_06_128,Yank the pole up!
s003_06_129,Like this?
s003_06_130,*Whooosh*
s003_06_131,Levi pulls the fishing rod up forcibly.
s003_06_132,Ooh uhhh!
s003_06_133,I-I caught it!
s003_06_134,Hahaha!
s003_06_135,I actually caught it!
s003_06_136,!!
s003_06_137,Little Mermaid stares at Levi intently.
s003_06_138,What? Why are you staring at me like that?
s003_06_139,This is the first time I've seen you laugh like that.
s003_06_140,What are you talking about?
s003_06_141,I didn't laugh THAT much...
s003_06_142,Hehe.
s003_06_143,You know what? Fishing ain't so bad!
s003_06_144,I'm gonna catch us a nice meal for tonight. You just watch.
s003_06_145,Ooh uh!
s003_06_146,"As they laugh together and get to know each other,"
s003_06_147,"time continues to flow, inexorable as ever."
s003_07_title,MUDFISH: 7
s003_07_1,A few days later.
s003_07_2,*Drip*
s003_07_3,"Ugh, will this stuff ever stop dripping?"
s003_07_4,It's so annoying.
s003_07_5,Levi wipes the black liquid off the floor.
s003_07_6,...
s003_07_7,Levi.
s003_07_8,Why does that black liquid come out of your body?
s003_07_9,What makes you ask?
s003_07_10,Because I'm curious.
s003_07_11,...
s003_07_12,I ate something bad.
s003_07_13,Ooh?
s003_07_14,"Don't ""oooh"" at me."
s003_07_15,What did you eat?
s003_07_16,... Black water.
s003_07_17,Ah uh?
s003_07_18,"The stuff that's always leaking from my head. Once I'd ingested that stuff, that's when all this started happening."
s003_07_19,...
s003_07_20,What? What are you looking at me like that for?
s003_07_21,You shouldn't eat stuff like that.
s003_07_22,It might give you a stomachache.
s003_07_23,Do you think I meant to eat that stuff?
s003_07_24,It was an accident. I fell.
s003_07_25,"At first, I thought it was just some dirty water, but..."
s003_07_26,How could I have known that this would happen?
s003_07_27,...
s003_07_28,What now?! Why have you looking so doom and gloom?
s003_07_29,It's perfectly fine for us to be in close proximity.
s003_07_30,"As long as you don't ingest it yourself, you'll be fine."
s003_07_31,Being near it won't harm you.
s003_07_32,Can I touch it?
s003_07_33,Touch what?
s003_07_34,The liquid that's seeping from your head.
s003_07_35,Absolutely not!
s003_07_36,Ooh?
s003_07_37,What if something goes wrong?
s003_07_38,"Once it's dripped onto the floor, it doesn't seem to affect other Nikkes,"
s003_07_39,"but I have no idea what would happen if you touched it straight from the source, as it were."
s003_07_40,If something bad happened to you...
s003_07_41,It's okay. Nothing will happen.
s003_07_42,I'd still rather not. Just to be safe.
s003_07_43,I'm going to touch it.
s003_07_44,...
s003_07_45,Little Mermaid touches the black liquid covering Levi's head.
s003_07_46,Hmm...
s003_07_47,Little Mermaid closely examines the black liquid on her hand.
s003_07_48,It seems to be some kind of liquid metal.
s003_07_49,Come again?
s003_07_50,It's not moving.
s003_07_51,What?
s003_07_52,Hmm...
s003_07_53,Ugh!
s003_07_54,What's wrong? Are you hurt?
s003_07_55,"You don't feel like you're melting, do you?"
s003_07_56,...
s003_07_57,"Argh, you drive me crazy sometimes, you know that?"
s003_07_58,Levi.
s003_07_59,Would you like me to teach you something?
s003_07_60,Huh? What?
s003_07_61,How to make bubbles.
s003_07_62,"What the... I've been begging you to teach me that for ages, and you've ignored me time and time again!"
s003_07_63,Now you're offering to teach me apropos of nothing? What's the big idea?
s003_07_64,I'm sorry if I frustrated you.
s003_07_65,This black liquid flowing from your head is similar to my bubbles.
s003_07_66,It's made of liquid metal.
s003_07_67,"I can't control it, but since it appears to be coming from you,"
s003_07_68,you may be able to.
s003_07_69,I'm... creating this stuff?
s003_07_70,Ooh!
s003_07_71,It's not like I'm doing it consciously.
s003_07_72,It doesn't matter whether it's intentional on your part or not. It's still being produced.
s003_07_73,This black liquid may be leaking from your head
s003_07_74,because you're unable to control it.
s003_07_75,"What's all this talk about ""intention""?"
s003_07_76,Of course this is all unintentional! Who would want something like this?
s003_07_77,No one wants to be seen as a monster.
s003_07_78,Do you have any idea what I've had to go through?
s003_07_79,"If you learn to control it, you might be able to stop it."
s003_07_80,I can stop this?
s003_07_81,You really think so?
s003_07_82,You might even be able to remove the parts of it that are stuck to you.
s003_07_83,I... I could?
s003_07_84,"I can't guarantee that it'll be a success,"
s003_07_85,but would you like to try?
s003_07_86,Yes!
s003_07_87,I want to try.
s003_07_88,I'm tired of being treated like a monster.
s003_07_89,I... I want to be a Nikke again.
s003_07_90,Okay.
s003_07_91,I'll do my best to teach you.
s003_07_92,"Unfortunately, no matter how much time passes..."
s003_07_93,Whew...
s003_07_94,Levi stretches out her hand and grimaces.
s003_07_95,I've gotta try and gather some of that black liquid at my fingertips...
s003_07_96,Hrrrngh!
s003_07_97,... There is no sign of change.
s003_07_98,...
s003_07_99,...
s003_07_100,Why don't we try again?
s003_07_101,"One day passes, and then another."
s003_07_102,C'mon... move... please!
s003_07_103,But still there is no change.
s003_07_104,Levi tries again and again.
s003_07_105,... Ah.
s003_07_106,...
s003_07_107,"But despite her attempts, nothing changes."
s003_07_108,...
s003_07_109,...
s003_07_110,Um... maybe if you try again...
s003_07_111,Forget it.
s003_07_112,Ooh?
s003_07_113,Let's give it up.
s003_07_114,It's not going to work anyway.
s003_07_115,There's no way someone like me could do this.
s003_07_116,Levi...
s003_07_117,Don't waste your energy. I'm a lost cause.
s003_07_118,It's fine. I'll just live like this forever.
s003_07_119,I'm used to it by now... It's okay.
s003_07_120,But...
s003_07_121,Siren.
s003_07_122,Don't get my hopes up.
s003_07_123,I'm not special. Anyone with half a brain could tell this is hopeless.
s003_07_124,"Don't give me false hope, or else I won't even have the courage to give up when I should."
s003_07_125,Do you realize how much I've wanted to be rid of this black liquid?
s003_07_126,"Hundreds of times a day, I wish for it to be gone."
s003_07_127,I tried dunking myself in the ocean all day long.
s003_07_128,I scrubbed at it until my parts nearly wore down.
s003_07_129,If you only knew the misery I felt once I realized that I was powerless to make it go away.
s003_07_130,Do you want me to feel that again?
s003_07_131,I don't want to!
s003_07_132,I don't want to ever feel that way again.
s003_07_133,I'm sick and tired of feeling miserable!
s003_07_134,... I'm sorry.
s003_07_135,... No.
s003_07_136,I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry.
s003_07_137,I-I want to be alone for a moment.
s003_07_138,Levi?
s003_07_139,I'm serious! Don't follow me.
s003_07_140,Levi runs off.
s003_07_141,Levi!
s003_08_title,MUDFISH: 8
s003_08_1,It was a sunny day.
s003_08_2,"I had been assigned to some simple resource collection,"
s003_08_3,and was wondering what I should do when I got back.
s003_08_4,Accidents really can come without warning.
s003_08_5,An innocuous black puddle on the roadside which didn't draw any attention to itself.
s003_08_6,The moment I stepped into the puddle...
s003_08_7,*Splash*
s003_08_8,I sank like a stone.
s003_08_9,"What I had thought was a shallow pool was in fact a fathomless reservoir,"
s003_08_10,deep enough to swallow my entire body.
s003_08_11,My body was engulfed by the black liquid.
s003_08_12,"As I sank deeper and deeper, it was as if I was being swallowed whole."
s003_08_13,"I felt like I was suffocating, and so I opened my mouth and gasped for air."
s003_08_14,"A Nikke's body naturally filters out any contamination, so I thought it would be fine."
s003_08_15,How wrong I was.
s003_08_16,I inhaled the black water.
s003_08_17,!!!
s003_08_18,"The moment I did, it felt as if my entire body was melting."
s003_08_19,Who knows. Maybe I actually did melt.
s003_08_20,"My head, my body, my shoulders, my legs, my hands, my feet... It was as if my entire being was being merged into the black water."
s003_08_21,I've never experienced such internal pandemonium.
s003_08_22,Everything was a jumble.
s003_08_23,Aaaagggh!
s003_08_24,It hurts!
s003_08_25,"Writhing in agony, I frantically swam upwards."
s003_08_26,"As I flailed, I extended my hand upward,"
s003_08_27,desperately grasping at anything I could.
s003_08_28,*Splash*
s003_08_29,I managed to pull myself out of the water.
s003_08_30,Urgh... *Cough cough!*
s003_08_31,It hurts! Oh it hurts!
s003_08_32,Gaaaah!
s003_08_33,I heard a scream.
s003_08_34,I think it was one of my squadmates.
s003_08_35,"Please, someone help... the pain... I can't..."
s003_08_36,I locked eyes with one of my squadmates.
s003_08_37,!!!
s003_08_38,Her eyes were filled with fear.
s003_08_39,Don't just stand there looking at me! Help me!
s003_08_40,I reached out towards them.
s003_08_41,I-it's a monster!
s003_08_42,I heard someone shout.
s003_08_43,"Everyone ran away in, fear-stricken and panicked, disappearing in seconds."
s003_08_44,They left me alone in front of that black puddle.
s003_08_45,... Why?
s003_08_46,*Drip*
s003_08_47,??
s003_08_48,"I felt something dripping from my forehead, and wiped at it with my hand."
s003_08_49,Huh?
s003_08_50,"Pulling back my hand, I could see it was black."
s003_08_51,*Drip*
s003_08_52,... Huh?
s003_08_53,"I started to panic, and frantically wiped at whatever it was that was dripping from my head."
s003_08_54,No... no no...
s003_08_55,"No matter how much I tried to wipe it away,"
s003_08_56,my hand kept coming back blackened.
s003_08_57,"I couldn't even tell which part of me needed cleaning, and so I looked back at the black puddle."
s003_08_58,...?
s003_08_59,Reflecting back at me was the face of someone I didn't recognize.
s003_08_60,!
s003_08_61,Ah...
s003_08_62,Aaaaahhhhh!
s003_08_63,I lost everything that day.
s003_08_64,"My friends, my body, my weapon, my name, my home... I lost them all."
s003_08_65,"I had no idea what had happened,"
s003_08_66,but the black liquid kept leaking from my head.
s003_08_67,"Every Nikke I came across would open fire,"
s003_08_68,terror rippling across their faces as they screamed and called me a monster.
s003_08_69,I stopped even entertaining the notion of asking for help.
s003_08_70,"On the occasions when I ran into skilled Nikkes squads,"
s003_08_71,they nearly killed me.
s003_08_72,"Despite all of this, I wanted to live."
s003_08_73,I wanted to survive.
s003_08_74,So I started summoning Raptures to distract the Nikkes.
s003_08_75,When I encountered Nikkes who would proceed to pursue me relentlessly...
s003_08_76,"Die, you monster!"
s003_08_77,Argh... No!
s003_08_78,That was when I realized I could make my eyes glow red.
s003_08_79,What the...?!
s003_08_80,Th-those eyes! Is that thing a Heretic?!
s003_08_81,That's right. I'm a Heretic!
s003_08_82,It can't be...
s003_08_83,*Thud thud thud thud*
s003_08_84,She's calling over Raptures!
s003_08_85,Is she really a Heretic...?
s003_08_86,You're damn right I am! I've called my pets over to deal with you!
s003_08_87,R-retreat!
s003_08_88,"Raptures would appear right on cue,"
s003_08_89,"and as I watched the Nikkes run away in terror,"
s003_08_90,I began to wonder if I'd really turned into a Heretic after all.
s003_08_91,"But other than being able to make my eyes go red when I wanted,"
s003_08_92,I didn't develop any other abilities.
s003_08_93,So I kept running away.
s003_08_94,"Again and again, I would make a desperate escape."
s003_08_95,"Until one day, I found a hidden cave near the beach where no one would come."
s003_08_96,"It was dark and scary inside,"
s003_08_97,so I picked up a small lantern and kept it on all day.
s003_08_98,...
s003_08_99,I'm cold.
s003_08_100,I felt so cold and alone.
s003_08_101,"I rubbed my palms together, curled up in a ball,"
s003_08_102,and wrapped myself up with layers of blankets I'd scavenged from elsewhere.
s003_08_103,I'm so cold...
s003_08_104,"No matter what I did, I couldn't chase away the cold."
s003_08_105,Then...
s003_08_106,I met Siren.
s003_08_107,Cinder... ella....
s003_08_108,Abe...
s003_08_109,I'm cold...
s003_08_110,"If she hadn't said she was cold, I would have left her there on the beach."
s003_08_111,"When she told me she had nowhere to go back to, I felt this sense of kinship with her."
s003_08_112,"The bed that she made for me, how she grilled those fish, and all the care she showered upon me..."
s003_08_113,It made me warm up to her.
s003_08_114,I wanted to prove I was worthy of being her friend.
s003_08_115,That I could be someone worth being seen with.
s003_08_116,"All she wanted was to help me, and what do I do? Get angry at her and storm off."
s003_08_117,Why did I run away?
s003_08_118,She didn't do anything wrong.
s003_08_119,...
s003_08_120,What if she doesn't like me anymore because of this? What will I do?
s003_08_121,What if she doesn't want to be around me anymore?
s003_08_122,Maybe she'll want to leave right away to go find her friends.
s003_08_123,I don't have any way to stop her.
s003_08_124,If she tells me she's decided to leave...
s003_08_125,I can't do anything.
s003_08_126,No. I can't let this happen.
s003_08_127,I have to go back and apologize to h...
s003_08_128,Levi.
s003_08_129,!!
s003_08_130,... Can we talk for a moment?
s003_09_title,MUDFISH: 9
s003_09_1,What are you doing here?!
s003_09_2,I told you I wanted to be alone for a moment!
s003_09_3,"I couldn't stand the idea of you out here alone, crying."
s003_09_4,I'm not crying!
s003_09_5,Levi. I'm sorry.
s003_09_6,I don't want to give up.
s003_09_7,What?
s003_09_8,The reason you're struggling right now is because I'm not doing a good job teaching you.
s003_09_9,I believe you have what it takes to control bubbles.
s003_09_10,What makes you believe in me so much?
s003_09_11,Ooh?
s003_09_12,You don't even know who I am.
s003_09_13,I might really be a Heretic.
s003_09_14,I could be changing my eye color and deceiving you
s003_09_15,because I want your power!
s003_09_16,*Shake shake*
s003_09_17,What are you shaking your head for?
s003_09_18,No.
s003_09_19,The Levi I know isn't like that.
s003_09_20,How do you know that?
s003_09_21,I had a friend who was similar to you.
s003_09_22,"No one believed in her, so she felt lonely."
s003_09_23,"She reached out her hand, asking for help, and everyone pushed it away."
s003_09_24,... Myself included.
s003_09_25,It's something I regret to this day.
s003_09_26,"So, I decided that if a situation like that were to ever happen again, I would believe."
s003_09_27,"I would think with my heart, not with my eyes."
s003_09_28,I would choose to trust my feelings above all else.
s003_09_29,"So I'm going to trust you, Levi."
s003_09_30,...
s003_09_31,"The Levi I've been hanging around with, the Levi that I trust entirely,"
s003_09_32,is no Heretic.
s003_09_33,You're not doing this because you're after my power.
s003_09_34,"You'll be able to harness the bubbles, Levi."
s003_09_35,You can do it.
s003_09_36,...
s003_09_37,*Sniff*
s003_09_38,Ugh...
s003_09_39,Levi hurriedly covers her eyes.
s003_09_40,Levi? Are you okay?
s003_09_41,Don't look!
s003_09_42,"*Sniff*... You're a real idiot, you know that?"
s003_09_43,So naïve... *sniff*.
s003_09_44,You'll get taken advantage of living like that.
s003_09_45,Hehe.
s003_09_46,Don't laugh!
s003_09_47,Levi stares at Little Mermaid.
s003_09_48,...
s003_09_49,I'm sorry.
s003_09_50,"I shouldn't have been so stubborn, and I shouldn't have gotten angry at you."
s003_09_51,Being scared is no excuse for giving up.
s003_09_52,It's okay.
s003_09_53,I would not betray you.
s003_09_54,Never.
s003_09_55,So even if I keep messing things up...
s003_09_56,Trust in me.
s003_09_57,Don't give up on me.
s003_09_58,I won't.
s003_09_59,I believe in you.
s003_09_60,... Thanks.
s003_10_title,MUDFISH: 10
s003_10_1,What's this?
s003_10_2,Levi stares at the enormous purple bubble that fills the cave.
s003_10_3,?
s003_10_4,It's a bubble!
s003_10_5,"I can see that, but what are you going to do with this thing?"
s003_10_6,It's massive!
s003_10_7,I thought you said you were going to teach me again.
s003_10_8,Oh.
s003_10_9,I'm going to teach you inside this.
s003_10_10,We're going inside that thing?
s003_10_11,Ooh!
s003_10_12,Both of us?
s003_10_13,That's right.
s003_10_14,Won't that kill me?
s003_10_15,*Shake shake*
s003_10_16,I've tried it before.
s003_10_17,"When I fell from space, this is what cushioned my fall."
s003_10_18,"Hold on, did I hear you right?"
s003_10_19,You've been to space?
s003_10_20,Ooh!
s003_10_21,"Yes. Anyway, I've never been inside this bubble with someone else,"
s003_10_22,but I'm sure it'll be fine.
s003_10_23,You don't sound too certain to me...
s003_10_24,Hehe.
s003_10_25,I never tried it before because I was afraid of the potential danger.
s003_10_26,"But I've thought about this back to front, and I simply don't think I can teach you as well as Abe did with me."
s003_10_27,"Therefore, I figured the best way would be to transfer my knowledge to you directly."
s003_10_28,... Fine.
s003_10_29,So... do we just head inside?
s003_10_30,*Nod*
s003_10_31,I'll go first.
s003_10_32,Hold on...!
s003_10_33,See you soon.
s003_10_34,Little Mermaid enters the bubble.
s003_10_35,Si-Siren?
s003_10_36,She just stepped in like it was nothing.
s003_10_37,Oh man... can't chicken out now...
s003_10_38,Ehh...
s003_10_39,Levi shuts her eyes tight and reaches a hand into the bubble.
s003_10_40,It's... warm?
s003_10_41,...
s003_10_42,"Ugh, fine, screw it!"
s003_10_43,Levi jumps into the bubble.
s003_10_44,*Blurb blurb*
s003_10_45,Levi opens her eyes.
s003_10_46,Golden rays of sunlight stream through the water.
s003_10_47,She can feel the warm water wrapping around her body.
s003_10_48,Am I underwater?
s003_10_49,"... I'm not dead, am I?"
s003_10_50,Levi!
s003_10_51,Siren!
s003_10_52,Where are we?
s003_10_53,Inside the bubble.
s003_10_54,I know that!
s003_10_55,"What I mean is, how are we underwater?"
s003_10_56,This is a space created by my NIMPH.
s003_10_57,They said it was a space which held a special place in my heart.
s003_10_58,So this place is important to you somehow?
s003_10_59,Levi looks around the water again.
s003_10_60,The streaks of sunlight are mesmerizing.
s003_10_61,"I suppose this place is awfully pretty, and warm."
s003_10_62,It's very fitting for you.
s003_10_63,Ah uh?
s003_10_64,"N-nothing! Anyway, what do I need to do?"
s003_10_65,Levi.
s003_10_66,I'm going to teach you everything there is to know about my bubbles.
s003_10_67,"That way, you'll be able to protect yourself,"
s003_10_68,and you'll never be lonely again.
s003_10_69,Little Mermaid reaches out to Levi.
s003_10_70,Will you take my hand and close your eyes?
s003_10_71,I will share everything about this power with you.
s003_10_72,... Okay.
s003_10_73,Levi takes Little Mermaid's hand.
s003_10_74,Little Mermaid closes her eyes.
s003_10_75,Levi closes her eyes as well.
s003_10_76,"Once she shuts her eyes,"
s003_10_77,she witnesses a mass of bubbles gathering and contorting
s003_10_78,This vision before her relays a vast store of knowledge which words alone could never possibly convey.
s003_10_79,Wh-what was that?
s003_10_80,This is crazy!
s003_10_81,Isn't it amazing?
s003_10_82,Yeah!
s003_10_83,Totally amazing!
s003_10_84,I want to know more.
s003_10_85,Hmm?
s003_10_86,Levi's eyes sparkle.
s003_10_87,"I want to know more, Siren!"
s003_10_88,How much are these bubbles capable of?
s003_10_89,Where do they come from? How do they work? What are all the ways they can be used?
s003_10_90,I want to know it all!
s003_10_91,I want to keep going!
s003_10_92,...!
s003_10_93,"Little Mermaid thinks back on that frightened girl in that dark cave, whose light had nearly been extinguished due to the cold and loneliness."
s003_10_94,"In contrast, before her now stands a girl whose once-fading light has been miraculously reignited."
s003_10_95,"Having been confronted with the brilliant truth of the world, her light is shining brightly once again."
s003_10_96,A girl who had once been living in deprivation now exudes a voracious and primal desire for truth.
s003_10_97,For life itself.
s003_10_98,"In the face of such luminous beauty,"
s003_10_99,Little Mermaid can only nod in agreement.
s003_10_100,All right.
s003_10_101,"Take it all, Levi. It's yours."
s003_10_102,Siren...
s003_10_103,Little Mermaid takes Levi's hand again.
s003_10_104,"Do it, and reignite that fire inside you."
s003_10_105,"Little Mermaid closes her eyes again,"
s003_10_106,and Levi does the same
s003_10_107,as she takes her hand.
s003_10_108,"As she does,"
s003_10_109,Levi sees the truth within the bubbles.
s003_10_110,The bubbles which are part of the vast sea that is Little Mermaid's NIMPH.
s003_10_111,I want to know more.
s003_10_112,I want to see more!
s003_10_113,More! More!
s003_10_114,*Blurb blurb*
s003_10_115,?!
s003_10_116,Levi opens her eyes at the sound of something bubbling.
s003_10_117,!!
s003_10_118,The serene water that had once been bathed in a flaxen light was now losing its glow as it percolates.
s003_10_119,"Siren, something's wrong with the water!"
s003_10_120,...
s003_10_121,Siren?
s003_10_122,*Boom*!
s003_10_123,The bubble explodes with a thundering roar.
s003_10_124,*Splash*
s003_10_125,"As the bubble bursts, the two Nikkes collapse onto the cave floor."
s003_10_126,Urgh!
s003_10_127,Blech!
s003_10_128,Levi vomits up the contents of her stomach.
s003_10_129,"Ugh, I'm dizzy... and my stomach doesn't feel so good..."
s003_10_130,*Thud*
s003_10_131,?
s003_10_132,...
s003_10_133,!!
s003_10_134,Siren!!
s003_10_135,...
s003_10_136,Wake up!
s003_10_137,Siren!
s003_10_138,"Levi crawls across the floor towards Siren, who has lost consciousness."
s003_10_139,Siren!
s003_10_140,She grabs Little Mermaid's hand.
s003_10_141,"Wake up, Siren!"
s003_10_142,Don't... don't die.
s003_10_143,"Please don't die, Siren."
s003_10_144,*Cough cough*
s003_10_145,Siren!
s003_10_146,Le... vi...
s003_10_147,Don't scare me like that! I really thought you were going to die!
s003_10_148,Hehe.
s003_10_149,How can you be laughing at a time like this?!
s003_10_150,Levi... We shouldn't... use this method again.
s003_10_151,I... nearly... lost myself back there.
s003_10_152,You did?!
s003_10_153,Are you okay?
s003_10_154,It's all my fault... I was dead set on knowing more.
s003_10_155,Siren grabs Levi's hand.
s003_10_156,It's okay.
s003_10_157,I'm just... a little tired.
s003_10_158,O-okay...
s003_10_159,*Sob* You better not die on me!
s003_10_160,What's the point of you teaching me everything if you up and die on me right after?
s003_10_161,Hehe.
s003_10_162,I don't see what's so funny!
s003_10_163,Levi.
s003_10_164,Are you... satisfied now?
s003_10_165,!!
s003_10_166,... Yeah.
s003_10_167,I know what I have to do now.
s003_10_168,I know how I can use this power.
s003_10_169,I know how you view this power as well.
s003_10_170,I know everything.
s003_10_171,I'll do everything I can to use this power for good.
s003_10_172,... Just like you.
s003_10_173,I'd like that.
s003_10_174,Abe always said that we should use our power for good.
s003_10_175,I will.
s003_10_176,Siren...
s003_10_177,Thank you.
s003_10_178,This... this is good.
s003_10_179,"Sorry, but I think I'm going to take a little nap."
s003_10_180,Siren?
s003_10_181,...
s003_10_182,Siren falls asleep.
s003_10_183,Phew... I can still hear her breathing.
s003_10_184,Thank goodness... urgh...
s003_10_185,"Levi experiences a wave of dizziness, and lies down on the floor."
s003_10_186,So dizzy... Can't hold on anymore.
s003_10_187,I think I'll go to sleep too...
s003_10_188,"Levi moreso faints than falls asleep, firmly clasping Little Mermaid's hand in hers."
s003_10_189,It's only three days later that they both regain consciousness.
s003_11_title,MUDFISH: 11
s003_11_1,"After Levi and Little Mermaid get out of the bubble,"
s003_11_2,some time passes.
s003_11_3,"You know something, Siren?"
s003_11_4,Ooh?
s003_11_5,That black liquid that used to flow from my head...
s003_11_6,"Ever since I started controlling the bubbles, it's stopped."
s003_11_7,Glad to hear it.
s003_11_8,I could see how much it worried you.
s003_11_9,Was it that obvious?
s003_11_10,"Every morning when you woke up, the first thing you'd do was wipe off the marks on your bed."
s003_11_11,Because you didn't want it getting stained.
s003_11_12,!!
s003_11_13,You saw that?
s003_11_14,Ooh!
s003_11_15,I thought I had kept it a secret...
s003_11_16,Hehe.
s003_11_17,I'm glad that it's stopped.
s003_11_18,One less thing for you to worry about.
s003_11_19,Yeah. It's a real weight off my shoulders.
s003_11_20,Plus now I can do stuff like this.
s003_11_21,A black water droplet appears at the tip of Leviathan's finger.
s003_11_22,I still can't get over it.
s003_11_23,How is this even possible?
s003_11_24,Who came up with this stuff?
s003_11_25,Abe.
s003_11_26,Abe?
s003_11_27,*Nod*
s003_11_28,Is that the name of the person who made you?
s003_11_29,Little Mermaid smiles brightly.
s003_11_30,Yes!
s003_11_31,Is that the friend you want to find?
s003_11_32,"One of them, yes."
s003_11_33,Um...
s003_11_34,Ooh?
s003_11_35,Sh-should I come with you?
s003_11_36,... Ooh?
s003_11_37,I can help you.
s003_11_38,I'll find them all for you!
s003_11_39,"If you tell me how your friends look, I'll help you find them."
s003_11_40,"If we look together, we're bound to find them faster!"
s003_11_41,...
s003_11_42,Are you sure you're okay with leaving this cave?
s003_11_43,O-of course!
s003_11_44,"Now that I've got power too,"
s003_11_45,why wouldn't I be?
s003_11_46,You were afraid of going outside before.
s003_11_47,"I was before, but I'm not scared anymore."
s003_11_48,It's dangerous outside.
s003_11_49,There might be situations where I can't protect you.
s003_11_50,Who asked you to protect me?
s003_11_51,I know how to handle bubbles now too!
s003_11_52,Still...
s003_11_53,"If you're really worried,"
s003_11_54,then let me prove it to you.
s003_11_55,Prove what to me?
s003_11_56,That I can take down a Rapture
s003_11_57,all on my own.
s003_11_58,"That'll show that I don't need you to protect me, and it won't be a problem for us to head out together."
s003_11_59,"That's true, but..."
s003_11_60,Give me one week.
s003_11_61,That's when you originally planned on leaving.
s003_11_62,I'll prove myself to you then.
s003_11_63,... Okay.
s003_11_64,"Good, then it's settled! Now, on that note!"
s003_11_65,"Today, I'm gonna use my bubbles to catch some fish."
s003_11_66,You think you can do that?
s003_11_67,Of course! I know how to do that much at least.
s003_11_68,I'm really good at changing the shape of bubbles.
s003_11_69,Very impressive!
s003_11_70,Haha! Right?
s003_11_71,Leviathan and Little Mermaid laugh as they share a look.
s003_11_72,"Let's go. Tonight, dinner's on me."
s003_11_73,Ah ooh!
s003_12_title,MUDFISH: 12
s003_12_1,One week later.
s003_12_2,*Thud thud thud thud*
s003_12_3,...
s003_12_4,Levi nervously watches the approaching Rapture.
s003_12_5,T-target detected.
s003_12_6,... Ooh uh.
s003_12_7,W-watch and learn!
s003_12_8,I'm gonna destroy that thing!
s003_12_9,Ooh!
s003_12_10,Phew....
s003_12_11,Levi glares at the distantly approaching Rapture.
s003_12_12,*Thud thud thud thud*
s003_12_13,She reaches her hand out and aims toward the Rapture.
s003_12_14,A mass of black droplets forms behind her.
s003_12_15,Here we go!
s003_12_16,As Levi swings her hand...
s003_12_17,*Swoosh*
s003_12_18,The black droplets shoot toward the Rapture's core.
s003_12_19,*Booom*!
s003_12_20,"As the core shatters, the Rapture collapses lifelessly to the ground."
s003_12_21,I-I did it!
s003_12_22,"I did it, Siren!"
s003_12_23,Ooh uh!
s003_12_24,This stuff really works!
s003_12_25,I can't believe I defeated a Rapture so easily!
s003_12_26,Hehe...
s003_12_27,Hahahaha!
s003_12_28,"If I'd known it'd go that well,"
s003_12_29,I'd have gotten a cellphone to record it for posterity!
s003_12_30,"That was incredible, Levi!"
s003_12_31,I told you I could do it!
s003_12_32,Now... can I go with you?
s003_12_33,...
s003_12_34,*Nod*
s003_12_35,Sure.
s003_12_36,Really?
s003_12_37,No caveats or anything like that?
s003_12_38,Nope.
s003_12_39,Haha! I did it!
s003_12_40,Should we get going straight away?
s003_12_41,Where should we go first?
s003_12_42,Tell me! Tell me!
s003_12_43,Let's head back to the cave and get our stuff first.
s003_12_44,Sure! Sounds good!
s003_12_45,"Hehe, it's finally happening!"
s003_12_46,Levi.
s003_12_47,Yeah?
s003_12_48,You seem awfully happy that we can go together.
s003_12_49,Of course!
s003_12_50,Do you have any idea
s003_12_51,how much I've wanted this?
s003_12_52,"Well, I'm happy that you're happy."
s003_12_53,Hehe... you're gonna make me blush.
s003_12_54,...
s003_12_55,Siren.
s003_12_56,Ooh?
s003_12_57,I'll find all of your friends for you.
s003_12_58,"You've done so much for me, and it's time I repay the favor."
s003_12_59,Hehe.
s003_12_60,"Hey, what are you laughing at? Do you not believe me?"
s003_12_61,"No, I'm just very happy, that's all."
s003_12_62,*Rumble*
s003_12_63,?!
s003_12_64,What was that?
s003_12_65,*Rumbbbbble*
s003_12_66,"With a resounding roar, the ground begins to shake."
s003_12_67,Uh-Ahhhh!
s003_12_68,Ooh-Ooh uh!
s003_12_69,Is it an earthquake?!
s003_12_70,It's coming from the forest.
s003_12_71,What's over there?
s003_12_72,*Booom*
s003_12_73,"With another massive tremor,"
s003_12_74,something erupts from beyond the forest.
s003_12_75,Wh-what is that?!
s003_12_76,!!
s003_12_77,Gluttony!
s003_13_title,MUDFISH: 13
s003_13_1,Gluttony?
s003_13_2,A giant Rapture that used to guard the Lift.
s003_13_3,First I've heard of it.
s003_13_4,Is it similar to a Tyrant-Class?
s003_13_5,"If we're going by classifications, technically yes, but in reality it's incomparably stronger."
s003_13_6,It's a true force of nature.
s003_13_7,Sounds pretty formidable.
s003_13_8,It is.
s003_13_9,It exists solely to carry out the commands which have been issued to it.
s003_13_10,"It cannot be reasoned with, and it cannot be stopped."
s003_13_11,So what was the command that it's been given?
s003_13_12,To consume everything in its path.
s003_13_13,"What do you mean by ""everything""?"
s003_13_14,"Exactly what it sounds like. Nikkes, Raptures, large-scale weapons, entire structures, the terrain itself. It swallows everything indiscriminately."
s003_13_15,So we're part of that thing's diet as well?
s003_13_16,... Yeah.
s003_13_17,What happens if you get eaten?
s003_13_18,I don't know. No one has lived to tell the tale.
s003_13_19,!!
s003_13_20,"So if that thing gets us, we're done for?"
s003_13_21,"Most likely, yes."
s003_13_22,What's it doing here anyway?
s003_13_23,There must have been something that piqued its appetite.
s003_13_24,What could that be?
s003_13_25,"Apparently, Gluttony is drawn to large energy sources."
s003_13_26,Maybe it was enticed by the energy that was released when you enlarged the bubble.
s003_13_27,"Wait, when was that?"
s003_13_28,!!
s003_13_29,"Hold on, do you mean that time when you were teaching me?"
s003_13_30,"Get out of here, Levi."
s003_13_31,What do you mean?
s003_13_32,I'm most likely the one that Gluttony is after.
s003_13_33,The only way we'll get it to give up the chase is if we get to the sea.
s003_13_34,So go. Head towards the water.
s003_13_35,"When you get there, just imagine your body being wrapped in bubbles, and go right in."
s003_13_36,You'll be able to ride the current and drift away. You can still escape with your life.
s003_13_37,But what about you?
s003_13_38,I'll distract Gluttony and make my escape later.
s003_13_39,"No matter what happens, I can't let it go after you."
s003_13_40,Absolutely not! I'm not going alone!
s003_13_41,You said we'd go together.
s003_13_42,"You promised that if I took down a Rapture, that we'd stick together."
s003_13_43,... I'm sorry.
s003_13_44,I can help you! We can fight this thing together!
s003_13_45,... Levi.
s003_13_46,What else do I need to do to prove myself to you?
s003_13_47,What do I need to do for you to let me stay with you?
s003_13_48,It's not about you proving yourself.
s003_13_49,Then what is it?!
s003_13_50,"Is it that I'm weak? You don't need me, is that it?"
s003_13_51,"I'm just a useless half-wit, aren't I?"
s003_13_52,That's not it.
s003_13_53,It's because I want to protect you.
s003_13_54,I know that.
s003_13_55,I know you want to keep me safe.
s003_13_56,And I also know I'm being stubborn right now.
s003_13_57,But you know what?
s003_13_58,I want to protect you as well.
s003_13_59,I don't want to be left alone again!
s003_13_60,I want to stay with you.
s003_13_61,I don't want to be inside that cave all alone again.
s003_13_62,I don't want to live like that anymore!
s003_13_63,...
s003_13_64,You're not scared?
s003_13_65,"No, I'm not scared."
s003_13_66,Really?
s003_13_67,Really!
s003_13_68,Didn't you say you trusted me? So start trusting me!
s003_13_69,!!
s003_13_70,"If you really believe in me,"
s003_13_71,then let's fight together!
s003_13_72,Have faith in me! Believe that I'll be able to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with you.
s003_13_73,...!
s003_13_74,... All right.
s003_13_75,I believe in you.
s003_13_76,I can see how confident you are.
s003_13_77,Let's fight together.
s003_13_78,Let's defeat Gluttony together... and find our friends.
s003_13_79,All right!
s003_14_title,MUDFISH: 14
s003_14_1,Whew...
s003_14_2,I'll start.
s003_14_3,Go for it.
s003_14_4,Ah ooh uh!
s003_14_5,"As Little Mermaid reaches out her hand,"
s003_14_6,a giant bubble begins to grow in the middle of the beach.
s003_14_7,...
s003_14_8,One hour ago.
s003_14_9,Let me make sure I've got the plan straight:
s003_14_10,You create a giant bubble on the beach.
s003_14_11,"Gluttony will sense the energy, and come to the shore."
s003_14_12,Ooh!
s003_14_13,"When it opens its mouth to swallow the bubble,"
s003_14_14,"you'll quickly transform the bubble into pillars,"
s003_14_15,and jam them inside so Gluttony can't close its mouth.
s003_14_16,Ah ooh!
s003_14_17,"That's when I come in, and use the black liquid to strike the core, which is inside its mouth."
s003_14_18,Mhmm.
s003_14_19,"And if, at any point, the plan doesn't seem to be working,"
s003_14_20,"I gather as much black liquid as possible, shove it into that ugly S.O.B.'s mouth, and hightail it to the sea before it's finished digesting."
s003_14_21,Right.
s003_14_22,"And if all else fails, we go and throw ourselves into the sea, regardless of whether it's chasing us or not."
s003_14_23,Ooh uh!
s003_14_24,That's right!
s003_14_25,Are we sure the core is inside its mouth?
s003_14_26,It should be.
s003_14_27,Since Abe said so.
s003_14_28,But you said you've never dealt with this thing before.
s003_14_29,So how are we sure?
s003_14_30,It should be there.
s003_14_31,Abe is never wrong.
s003_14_32,"*Sigh*... I guess we don't have much choice, do we? You seem pretty confident, in any case."
s003_14_33,"Fine, let's give it a shot."
s003_14_34,Back to the present.
s003_14_35,I don't know why I agreed to this.
s003_14_36,Are you sure we can pull this off?
s003_14_37,"You're not nervous, are you?"
s003_14_38,"N-no, of course not!"
s003_14_39,Not one bit!
s003_14_40,I... I was just going over the plan in my mind.
s003_14_41,It's okay.
s003_14_42,Everything will work out.
s003_14_43,R-right... Everything'll work out. Of course.
s003_14_44,"Whew... Fine! Whatever happens, happens!"
s003_14_45,I'm finished with the preparations.
s003_14_46,Let's hide behind that rock.
s003_14_47,All right.
s003_14_48,Levi and Little Mermaid hide behind a large boulder near the shore.
s003_14_49,*Rummmmmble*
s003_14_50,The ground shakes violently.
s003_14_51,It's moving!
s003_14_52,!!
s003_14_53,That was fast.
s003_14_54,"A colossal being begins to approach from afar, resembling a moving mountain."
s003_14_55,*Rummmmmble*
s003_14_56,...
s003_14_57,"Levi swallows dryly, her nerves on edge."
s003_14_58,*Boom*!
s003_14_59,"With a resounding tremor, the goliath suddenly disappears."
s003_14_60,Huh?
s003_14_61,It... disappeared?
s003_14_62,!!
s003_14_63,What the heck? Where did that hulking thing go?
s003_14_64,Below!
s003_14_65,What?
s003_14_66,Little Mermaid quickly grabs Levi and leaps backward.
s003_14_67,*Craaack*!
s003_14_68,"In the spot where they were only milliseconds before,"
s003_14_69,an immense mouth erupts from underneath.
s003_14_70,Wh-what is that?!
s003_14_71,It's Gluttony!
s003_14_72,That's Gluttony?
s003_14_73,I'm supposed to take down that thing?
s003_14_74,"Levi, let's start the plan!"
s003_14_75,O-okay!
s003_14_76,Encounter!
s003_15_title,MUDFISH: 15
s003_15_1,*Shrrrrieek*!
s003_15_2,Gluttony heads toward the bubble and opens its mouth.
s003_15_3,Hyah!
s003_15_4,"As Little Mermaid reaches out her hand,"
s003_15_5,*Cracccck*!
s003_15_6,the bubble shapeshifts into two massive pillars which shoot up and force Gluttony's mouth wide open.
s003_15_7,Success!
s003_15_8,!!
s003_15_9,"Levi, I can see the core! It's deep inside its throat!"
s003_15_10,You can?
s003_15_11,Yeah! I can see something red and round! Abe was right!
s003_15_12,O-okay!
s003_15_13,Levi stands behind Little Mermaid.
s003_15_14,Core... core... where's the core...
s003_15_15,Levi peers into Gluttony's gaping maw.
s003_15_16,I've got to find that core...
s003_15_17,"A sea of serrated teeth, sharp enough to tear Leviathan to shreds."
s003_15_18,"Behind them, a pitch-black throat which could swallow her whole."
s003_15_19,"Amongst this terrifying spectacle, she can make out the glare of a red light."
s003_15_20,*Crrrrrack*
s003_15_21,Gluttony begins to close its mouth again.
s003_15_22,*Gasp*!
s003_15_23,Hrrrrngh!
s003_15_24,It's... too strong...!
s003_15_25,I-I've got to hurry!
s003_15_26,Fear courses through Levi.
s003_15_27,*Crack* *Craaack*
s003_15_28,Levi... Hurry up...
s003_15_29,"Damn, there's no time!"
s003_15_30,...
s003_15_31,An overwhelming sense of fear threatens to paralyze Levi.
s003_15_32,!!
s003_15_33,Levi?
s003_15_34,"C'mon, you can do this..."
s003_15_35,Levi lifts up her hand and gestures towards Gluttony.
s003_15_36,*Shake shake shake*
s003_15_37,M-my hand is shaking...
s003_15_38,Levi!
s003_15_39,You don't think you can do it?
s003_15_40,N-no. I can do it.
s003_15_41,I... I can...
s003_15_42,What should I do?
s003_15_43,"I'm sorry, Siren. I can't do it."
s003_15_44,I'm scared.
s003_15_45,I've got to hurry and tell her I'm not up to it.
s003_15_46,"At the very least, I need to shove as much black liquid into its mouth as I can."
s003_15_47,But I'm terrified. I can't move.
s003_15_48,What should I do?
s003_15_49,I said I would do it.
s003_15_50,"If I back out now, Siren will be disappointed."
s003_15_51,What if she ends up hating me for it?
s003_15_52,"She'll find out she doesn't need dead weight like me around,"
s003_15_53,and she'll leave me alone
s003_15_54,"in that dark cave, all alone."
s003_15_55,"Levi, are you okay?"
s003_15_56,!!
s003_15_57,"I-if you can't do it... then get in the water, quick!"
s003_15_58,I-I'm sorry! I'll do it!
s003_15_59,*Crunch*!
s003_15_60,!!
s003_15_61,The bubble broke!
s003_15_62,Siren!
s003_15_63,*Thump*
s003_15_64,Gluttony closes its mouth.
s003_15_65,!!
s003_15_66,*Squelch*
s003_15_67,"The bubble is shattered, remnants scattering all over."
s003_15_68,Siren!
s003_15_69,*Rummmmmble*
s003_15_70,Gluttony slowly turns...
s003_15_71,!!
s003_15_72,And directly faces Levi.
s003_15_73,N...
s003_15_74,N-no...
s003_15_75,Don't!
s003_15_76,Don't come near!
s003_15_77,*Creak*
s003_15_78,Gluttony opens its mouth.
s003_15_79,Stay away!
s003_15_80,Levi turns away and runs.
s003_15_81,Ahhhhhh!!!
s003_15_82,"She runs and runs,"
s003_15_83,her eyes clamped shut as she desperately sprints forward.
s003_15_84,She doesn't give herself a moment to look back.
s003_15_85,"It feels as if the ground beneath her is collapsing, but Levi barely registers it."
s003_15_86,"Her entire being is fixated on escaping from this terrifying creature,"
s003_15_87,not being engulfed by that pitiless mouth.
s003_15_88,Her main desire is to survive.
s003_15_89,"After running for who knows how long, Levi stops and gasps for breath."
s003_15_90,Her lungs feel like they are about to burst. She finally opens her eyes.
s003_15_91,*Gasp*... *Gasp*...!
s003_15_92,A collapsed building comes into view.
s003_15_93,?
s003_15_94,What is this?
s003_15_95,There aren't any buildings even remotely close to the cave...
s003_15_96,Everything around her is silent.
s003_15_97,No signs of life can be felt.
s003_15_98,Glu-Gluttony...!
s003_15_99,She looks back.
s003_15_100,!!
s003_15_101,"There's no sight of Gluttony, the beach, or anything."
s003_15_102,Wh-what... How did I get here?
s003_15_103,*Splash*
s003_15_104,Huh?
s003_15_105,The ground is covered in black liquid.
s003_15_106,Black liquid? Why...
s003_15_107,Levi reaches towards the black liquid.
s003_15_108,*Swoosh*
s003_15_109,!!
s003_15_110,Her hand is sucked inside the liquid.
s003_15_111,?!
s003_15_112,Levi stumbles backward.
s003_15_113,How the... why did my hand...
s003_15_114,A sudden feeling rises within Levi.
s003_15_115,"For some reason she can't fully understand, she feels that she could venture through the black liquid unimpeded."
s003_15_116,Was I running through this black liquid that entire time? Is that how I got here?
s003_15_117,Leviathan looks back in the direction she thinks the beach is in.
s003_15_118,... No way.
s003_15_119,Did I really just do that?
s003_15_120,No...
s003_15_121,I'm capable of so much...
s003_15_122,and yet I let Siren get eaten by that thing?
s003_15_123,No.
s003_15_124,"... No, no, no!"
s003_15_125,I shouldn't be able to do something like this!
s003_15_126,"If I can do this, then why did Siren..."
s003_15_127,"I hesitated, and got her killed."
s003_15_128,"I had this kind of power the entire time, and still I faltered."
s003_15_129,And Siren paid for it with her life!
s003_15_130,"She trusted me, and I betrayed her!"
s003_15_131,No...
s003_15_132,No no no...
s003_15_133,Nooooo!
s003_15_134,Levi drops to the ground and curls into a ball.
s003_15_135,She looks at her reflection in the black liquid.
s003_15_136,You're a traitor...
s003_15_137,Levi strikes at the reflection in front of her.
s003_15_138,Nothing but a traitor!
s003_15_139,"She slams a clenched fist into the ground, nearly hard enough to shatter her hand."
s003_15_140,"Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor!"
s003_15_141,She strikes the ground again and again.
s003_15_142,Aaaaaaahhhhhh!
s003_15_143,"No matter how many strikes she gives, the reflection of the detestable traitor before her refuses to disappear."
s003_15_144,*Sob*....
s003_15_145,I'm sorry...
s003_15_146,I'm so sorry!
s003_15_147,It's my fault.
s003_15_148,*Sob*... I'm sorry...
s003_15_149,"No matter how many times she apologizes, Siren's voice is nowhere to be heard."
s003_15_150,I messed up everything...
s003_15_151,*Sob*... Siren... Siren!
s003_15_152,"No matter how many tears she sheds,"
s003_15_153,it doesn't change the fact that she betrayed Siren.
s003_15_154,MUDFISH: END
s003_16_title,MUDFISH: EPILOGUE
s003_16_1,Present time. On the surface.
s003_16_2,Coo?
s003_16_3,What is it?
s003_16_4,Did you find something?
s003_16_5,Yuni?
s003_16_6,Coo!
s003_16_7,Mihara follows Yuni's gaze.
s003_16_8,Hmm...
s003_16_9,The color of the ground here is different.
s003_16_10,This is a serious swathe of land.
s003_16_11,I'd reckon it's nearly the size of a skyscraper.
s003_16_12,I don't think we know of anything that exists at that size.
s003_16_13,Mihara touches the ground.
s003_16_14,The ground is squishy...
s003_16_15,...
s003_16_16,"With a degree of caution, Mihara presses down on the ground."
s003_16_17,Cooo?
s003_16_18,Hm...
s003_16_19,"Either something passed not far below the surface,"
s003_16_20,or something emerged from underground.
s003_16_21,"Grave Digger burrows deep underground, so it wouldn't leave any traces like this."
s003_16_22,"I've never heard of a subterranean Rapture either, at least not one this size."
s003_16_23,"Hehe, maybe we're dealing with an oversized mole."
s003_16_24,Coo?
s003_16_25,The only explanation I can come up with is that it's some type of Rapture we're not familiar with.
s003_16_26,Coo!
s003_16_27,Looks like we finally found
s003_16_28,our first target.
s003_16_29,"All right, then."
s003_16_30,Let's start tracking.
