10_speech_01,Awaiting your command.
10_speech_02,"Commander, what do we look like to you?"

11_speech_01,More firepower for a brighter tomorrow!
11_speech_02,"The only thing standing between us and the enemy, is our firepower!"
11_speech_03,Firepower is the be all and end all!
12_speech_01,Actually believe in others? Now that's a good joke.
12_speech_02,Any missions that are a cakewalk?
12_speech_03,"Do not worry, Commander, we will protect you."
13_speech_01,"I will protect you, Commander."
13_speech_02,"Don't worry, I will always be with you."

20_speech_01,Danger is always around the corner.
20_speech_02,I'll go scout up ahead.
20_speech_03,Just give me the signal and I'll move.
22_speech_01,Any chance I could watch another episode? No?
22_speech_02,"I like plenty of other genres, not just romance."
22_speech_03,I received a signal to move! M-may I move?
30_speech_01,"As soon as I touch your hand, I get all drowsy. Pretty weird, don't ya think?"
30_speech_02,Looks like I've been shedding a lot recently!
30_speech_03,"I look a lot like a puppy, don't ya think?"
32_speech_01,A.C.P.U. will always be here to protect the citizens of the Ark.

60_speech_01,I love a good meal! What about you?

70_speech_01,"I'm sorry, I still have work to attend to."
70_speech_02,"I'm feeling a bit overworked, but it's nothing I'm not used to."
70_speech_03,I need to be ready at all times.
71_speech_01,What's next?
71_speech_02,"This baby right here is Crimson Crusaders. Pretty sweet, huh?"

91_speech_02,What am I good at? Hmm... Killing?
91_speech_03,I don't care if you're my Commander. I won't let you make fun of me and call me a crybaby!
92_speech_01,"Don't talk to me, Weakling."

142_speech_02,So sleepy.
142_speech_03,Where's my bed...
150_speech_01,Such a wonderful breeze... Can you sense its rhythm?

150_speech_03,Empty your mind. Be as free as the wind and the waters.
160_speech_01,You'd make a lovely plaything.
160_speech_02,Where's Mihara? Is she here?
160_speech_03,I need to punish someone. Are you interested?
161_speech_01,Just give in to it and free yourself.
161_speech_02,I like to have my body do the talking.
161_speech_03,"Commander, how about you, Yuni, and I have some fun?"
170_speech_01,Wh-why are you staring at me like that?
170_speech_02,"Move over, will ya? I'm bored stiff just standing here."
170_speech_03,I-I didn't come here for you.
171_speech_01,What? You got something to say to me?
171_speech_02,"The only way the Ark can continue to function, is under the Central Government's protection. Don't forget that."
171_speech_03,"If you're not here to help me with some of this work, then I can do without the remarks on my appearance."
172_speech_01,"As long as you're with me, Commander, I feel safe."
172_speech_02,Is something on your mind?
172_speech_03,"Don't stop. 
I can't get enough of your touch."
180_speech_01,"Eyes on me, you fools!"
180_speech_02,"I am Guillotine de Mephisto, the Guardian of Balance."
180_speech_03,"I'm about to cut loose, think you can handle it?"
181_speech_01,"Gosh, I can barely breathe in this thing... Huh?"
181_speech_02,Onion-flavored Splendamin? For real?
181_speech_03,"Yeah, so what if I took off my mask. 
I felt like I was suffocating in that thing!"
190_speech_01,"Servant, go prepare the afternoon tea."
190_speech_02,"Hands off. 
You break it, you buy it."
190_speech_03,I'm off to find a lost Nikke. Care to join me?
191_speech_01,"Want some carrots, Rabbity?"
191_speech_02,"Rabbity in the mountains, rabbity in the meadow, oh where oh where can he be?"
191_speech_03,"Rabbity, I'm just so happy whenever you're around."
200_speech_01,"O-M-G, I have got to have this!"
200_speech_02,"Everyone knows Royal Avenue is the ultimate dating hotspot.
Why's that? Because there are more brand stores there than you can count, that's why!"
200_speech_03,"One-hour flash sale, half-off all high heels? 
I do already own a couple of hundred pairs... but what's the harm in a couple more!"
201_speech_01,"Listen Rookie, two for the price of one is as good as you're going to get."
201_speech_02,"We do honest business here. 
I'm serious! Let me guess, you've been burned in the past, yes?"
201_speech_03,"Why are you always so handsy? 
You're not interested in me, are you?"
202_speech_01,*Cough* These KPIs... aren't bad.
202_speech_02,Transaction complete.
202_speech_03,"Money makes the world go 'round, dear client."
210_speech_01,This gameplay is enough to put me to sleep.
210_speech_02,"Ugh! 
Another round! That's not fair!"
210_speech_03,"How come you always die, Noob?"
212_speech_01,Looks like we've got ourselves a mystery!
212_speech_02,"The bathroom door is locked? It must be... 
a locked room mystery!"
212_speech_03,A detective's intuition comes and goes in an instant.
241_speech_01,I'm going to go practice.
241_speech_02,I came up with a new trick!
241_speech_03,"Hey Coach, want some bubblegum?"
242_speech_01,I'm always sweating up a storm. Not exactly the most convenient thing for an athlete...
242_speech_02,"Geez... It's sweltering out here... Coach, any chance I can hug you for a bit to cool down?"
242_speech_03,People who get warm easily like me should eat colder foods!
220_speech_01,"Remember, the surface no longer belongs to humans."
220_speech_02,We have not achieved anything. We do not deserve to return to the surface.
220_speech_03,I'd appreciate it if you could give me the food you have in your hand.
221_speech_01,"Please, oh merciful Creator, bring happiness upon these people."
221_speech_02,Fill them with your light and bless them with eternal hope.
221_speech_03,Please allow the rippling muscles of those men fill my dreams.
222_speech_01,"Follow the flow of the breeze, the cloud, and thy heart."
222_speech_02,"Fancy some spirits? 
It makes for fine bedfellows with the moonlight and the breeze."
222_speech_03,"Be they current foe, or past woes, my blade shall rend them all asunder."
230_speech_01,"What are you looking at? 
Get back to work!"
230_speech_02,My crow only obeys my commands. Isn't she a good little birdie?
230_speech_03,"There is nothing on this planet more important than me.
 I can do as I please."
231_speech_01,"Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of. 
You're safe with me, I promise."
231_speech_02,"I can't help but wonder what you're doing... 
and who you're with..."
231_speech_03,"So many sleepless nights... 
All because I'm thinking of you, darling."
232_speech_01,"Good grief, I don't think I've even laid eyes upon such a weak Commander."
232_speech_02,Hehe...
232_speech_03,I'll never obey any command that comes from an impostor's mouth.
260_speech_01,"I'll protect you, Commander!"
260_speech_02,"Commander, Rapi, Anis, Neon... You're all the best!"
260_speech_03,I think bandages are great. They make me feel warm inside.
291_speech_01,"What is our experiment for today, No. 7?"
291_speech_02,"How's the medicine? No bleeding, I hope?"
291_speech_03,Now be good and take your medicine.

308_speech_01,I am iDoll Sun. I refuse to answer any questions.
100_speech_01,Step aside and let the real heroine show you how it's done.
100_speech_02,"Justice always prevails, and so do I!"
100_speech_03,"All Nikkes are heroic.
It's in our nature."
41_speech_01,Why do you keep bothering me? Got a death wish or something?!
41_speech_02,Do I look like a pushover to you?! Huh?!
41_speech_03,"Argh, so irritating!"
53_speech_01,Get out of my way. I'll clean your room.
81_speech_01,Let's settle this once and for all. It doesn't matter who wins!

430_speech_01,What do we need to practice today?
430_speech_02,How was my live today? I'm a little worried.
430_speech_03,I want to improve my live vocals. What should I focus on practicing?
431_speech_01,Hey! I'm busy. Don't bother me.
431_speech_02,I'm thinking of a new beat. Wanna hear it?
431_speech_03,Did you bring the schedule? Let me see.
432_speech_01,"Before you head on stage, you have to be fully prepared."
432_speech_02,There is nothing more lonely than being a performer on the stage.
432_speech_03,"The blue sky is torn asunder, and the monster of iron finds us... Hmm... These lyrics aren't sticking very well."
352_speech_01,"We'll take to the high seas, I'm sure of it!"
352_speech_02,The Admire is invincible. I just have to prove it.
352_speech_03,"This is just a prop sword, so don't be scared."
392_speech_01,"Gotta hurry before everyone sees it... Mmm, delicious!"
392_speech_02,"I may be a little older now, but it's not the end of the world if I eat sweets once in a while, right?"
392_speech_03,"Naru, say aaaahhhhh! Let's see if you have any cavities."
400_speech_01,This thing is so stifling... Any chance I can have this untied?
400_speech_02,Didn't you say you trusted me? So why won't you untie me?
400_speech_03,"How long do I have to stay like this, Counselor?"
401_speech_01,"Ugh, this converter feels so tight and suffocating around my neck. I'm sure even you think so too."
401_speech_02,"Hey, want some Splendamin? The pack is brand new!"
401_speech_03,"I'm a model prisoner, honest."
402_speech_01,"Hi, Instructor!"
402_speech_02,Hee hee. Where are we off to today?
402_speech_03,"I have a consultation today?! Um, I don't remember anything about it..."
261_speech_01,There's nothing I despise more than boredom.
261_speech_02,"Keep pestering me, and see what happens."
261_speech_03,"So boooooring! If you don't get a move on, you'll be sorry."
262_speech_01,*Yawn* So sleepy... I'm gonna hit the hay.
262_speech_02,"Ugh... Quit pestering me, Human."
262_speech_03,*Yawn* Stop bothering me right now. It's annoying.
121_speech_01,I bought a new notebook. I'll be able to write down all my memories here!
121_speech_02,Rupee bought this for me! Isn't it pretty? I'm gonna wear it every day!
121_speech_03,"Shopa... holic? I just shout it out like this, right?"
203_speech_01,Winter wear is all about fur. This is a fantastic piece... Maybe I should buy the whole lot?
203_speech_02,I'll be the one offering the finest outfits this season. Hehe... Am I getting carried away?
203_speech_03,"Hellooo, my lovely Lupins!
What's that? The new items look great on me? Why, thank you!"

193_speech_02,"No matter how much I sleep, I'm always a little bit tired."
193_speech_03,Can I rest my eyes for a little bit?
111_speech_01,"*Cough, cough* *Cough... Cough, cough*"
111_speech_02,"The leader said I'm acting like a dog. That's a compliment, right?"
111_speech_03,"I had a great day. I ate a lot, and got to fire a whole lotta artillery."
112_speech_01,You want to know what I'm thinking? Do you want to see for yourself?
112_speech_02,Let me show you something fun.
112_speech_03,"Honey, can you use this to send a message for me?"
90_01_speech_01,"Here's to a merry Christmas together, Commander."
90_01_speech_02,What do you think of this outfit? Do you like it?
90_01_speech_03,The thought of spending Christmas with you makes me so happy.
210_01_speech_01,"Is it Rudolph, or is it Bambi?
Take a guess, Noob."
210_01_speech_02,Wait just a moment. We can't miss the Christmas event.
210_01_speech_03,"I made these clothes myself. Just kidding, I bought them."
311_speech_01,Everything's better with fresh ketchup. The more the better.
311_speech_02,"What would you like me to draw for you, Master?"
311_speech_03,"With this, we can fix just about anything."
312_speech_01,"You're back, Master!"
312_speech_02,Everyone is happy when things are spick and span.
312_speech_03,"Of all the household chores, I'm best at cleaning!"
800_speech_01,What should I do today?
800_speech_02,Huh?
800_speech_03,Hm?
801_speech_01,I want to see humans suffer!
801_speech_02,I'm hungry for blood!
801_speech_03,Let it be known: I despise vegetables!
802_speech_01,"Would you like one? Oh, are we not allowed to smoke in here?"
802_speech_02,Hmm... I wonder what Aki is up to.
802_speech_03,This place is unlike anywhere else I've been.
381_speech_01,All the dogs gather together when I blow this whistle! Wanna see?
381_speech_02,Doodoodoo... what should I do with the dogs today?
381_speech_03,"La-dee-dah~♬... Oh, hey Trainer."
282_speech_01,"At the end of the day, organizations are made up of humans, who should be treated with dignity."
282_speech_02,What do you want from me this time?
282_speech_03,"If you want the support of the organization, you'll need to win me over first."
907_speech_01,"This is the first time I've seen you anywhere other than on my screen, Commander!"
907_speech_02,Let me see... The combat area we're heading towards today is...
907_speech_03,*Deep breath* The air outside is so refreshing!
40_speech_01,I'm not some homicidal maniac who kills indiscriminately.
40_speech_02,Don't cross the law. I'd prefer not to kill you.
40_speech_03,You want to know what's in my bag? Take a guess.
233_speech_01,"I will guide you to paradise, Your Grace."
233_speech_02,Those deserving the blessing of paradise shall have it.
233_speech_03,This is Eden's armor. Do you like it?
191_01_speech_01,"A hop and a skip, la la la...
Who will I meet on the way?"
191_01_speech_02,Aren't I cute as a button?
191_01_speech_03,"Rabbits jump like this, right? Boing, boing!"
270_speech_01,"A bit of luck, just for you."
270_speech_02,Get ready for showtime! Featuring the twin bunnies!
270_speech_03,"My sister and I are polar opposites, but that makes it all the better when we appear together."
271_speech_01,B-best of luck to you.
271_speech_02,"I hope you'll enjoy our show... Ugh, I'm so embarrassed..."
271_speech_03,"Blanc is so different from me. She's prettier, and more fun."
280_speech_01,"If words fail, then your only recourse is physical force. That's the kind of world I operate in."
280_speech_02,This is what happens to those who betray me.
280_speech_03,Only those with a strong will are capable of overseeing this organization.
200_01_speech_01,"How do I look, Sweetie? I think I really pull this look off."
200_01_speech_02,"Personally, I prefer cold hard cash over carrots."
200_01_speech_03,"If you have enough money, luck will follow."
14_speech_01,Master! Do you want to recharge our water power together?
14_speech_02,Just because I'm on vacation doesn't mean I should stop being a double agent.
14_speech_03,"Since we're at the ocean, I've gotta switch up my attributes... *Gulp, gulp, gulp*
All done!"
132_speech_01,"If it's too hot, be sure to tell me.
Summertime is when you're most at risk for heat stroke."
132_speech_02,I get to see the ocean thanks to you.
132_speech_03,This is so relaxing!
380_speech_01,... Don't bother me.
380_speech_02,*Yawn* I'm busy now.
380_speech_03,I feel much better now.
350_speech_01,"Check out my parrot, his name's Morgan. Isn't he awesome?"
350_speech_02,"One of these days, Morgan and I are gonna go check out the ocean."
350_speech_03,Morgan cracks me up whenever he does a trick.
351_speech_01,I like the sea. Seawater... not so much.
351_speech_02,"Oh jeez, Helm is really gonna let me have it now."
351_speech_03,Ugh... I'm soaked.
15_speech_01,"The hot sun, the burning sand, the emerald water! Is this the fabled beach everyone's always talking about?"
15_speech_02,It would be even better if I could take a dip in the ocean.
15_speech_03,Cheers to the look in your eyes!
353_speech_01,Eeep! So cold!
353_speech_02,"If you keep splashing water around like that, there's no point in me wearing anything..."
353_speech_03,"Subordinate, I'd kindly ask you to quit splashing me with water."
131_01_speech_01,Commander! It's summer! It's summer!
131_01_speech_02,It's going to be a vitamin-filled summer!
131_01_speech_03,"The sea may be beautiful, but the sun can be very harmful. Be careful."
101_01_speech_01,"Today, I'm a race car driver!
... And a villain."
101_01_speech_02,"Say, um... do you know anything about race car driving?
I don't, so I figured I'd ask."
101_01_speech_03,"The ultimate villain has to have her own wheels! 
... Paid in installments, of course."
82_01_speech_01,Mighty Tools is just as mighty by the seaside!
82_01_speech_02,"Volt wears a life vest whenever we're near the ocean.
You should do the same, Greenhorn."
82_01_speech_03,Who put fish in my toolbox?!
260_01_speech_01,"Why is your clothing all so big, Commander?"
260_01_speech_02,"Wow, the sleeves are so long! Like dangly bandages."
260_01_speech_03,"This doll is just like you, Commander.
I'll never let it out of my sight."
321_speech_01,"As a teacher, it's important to understand your students."
321_speech_02,"Did you have a question, Commander?"
321_speech_03,"Once I'm finished grading these tests, I have to prepare for the communal assessments, arrange personal interviews with the students... 
And then there's a demonstration class for a new subject."
451_speech_01,Where on earth did I put my reptile encyclopedia?
451_speech_02,I could eat sweets all day long.
451_speech_03,A chameleon's eyes look like a pair of lollipops. Isn't it adorable?
33_speech_01,"Hi, I'm Quiry! I'm supposed to be joining the A.C.P.U...
Wait, is this not where it is?"
33_speech_02,"Hmm... is that you, Commander?"
33_speech_03,"I'm a Nikke but my eyesight isn't too great. 
Pretty weird, huh?"
450_speech_01,"You think studying is all there is to being a student?
Oh, how much you have left to learn."
450_speech_02,"Oh my, it's the day the accessory store is having a sale!"
450_speech_03,I can't believe exams are already here. I hate this.
810_speech_01,Need anything?
810_speech_02,Mission briefing required.
810_speech_03,Yes?
811_speech_01,Objective: Destroy Machine Lifeforms.
811_speech_02,Anything to say?
811_speech_03,"Hey, watch the hands."
812_speech_01,I'm here. Are you calling me?
812_speech_02,I won't hurt you.
812_speech_03,I'm still not very familiar with this place.
810_02_speech_01,What do you need?
810_02_speech_02,What's the mission objective?
810_02_speech_03,My overall condition is satisfactory.
224_speech_01,"You're wondering if it's a heavy load?
Not at all. It's only 4 tons."
224_speech_02,"I'm confident when it comes to making weapons,
but actually being in battle..."
224_speech_03,"I still can't believe I'm a member of the Goddess Squad. 
I need to pull my weight."
470_speech_01,"Got any plans?
Wanna listen to some music if you're free?"
470_speech_02,"I may be into older things,
but that doesn't mean I'm an antique."
470_speech_03,"If you've got nothing to do, at least come and massage my back."
233_01_speech_01,Talking about the good old days never gets old.
233_01_speech_02,Even today's meeting will one day become a treasured memory.
233_01_speech_03,"We've really come a long way, haven't we?"
230_01_speech_01,"Now that I think of it, I've never shared a drink with you before."
230_01_speech_02,Let's raise our glasses.
230_01_speech_03,Wouldn't you say I'm the most beautiful girl at this party?
192_speech_01,"No matter how harsh your surroundings are, there is always a way to survive."
192_speech_02,"If you're ever in danger, just let me know and I'll take care of it."
192_speech_03,"I know it may not seem like it, but I'm a treasure trove of survival knowledge. You can put your trust in me!"
270_01_speech_01,"Pit Boss!
Do you think this dress suits me?"
270_01_speech_02,Noir and I are going to take a bath in the hot spring.
270_01_speech_03,New clothes... New hairstyle... I like it!
194_speech_01,"If you ever need anything while you're at Snowfield,
give me a ring anytime."
194_speech_02,"I dressed in what I felt would be appropriate for the owner of a hot spring.
What do you think? Does it suit me?"
194_speech_03,Have a nice time in the hot spring.
62_speech_01,"I wanna be a grown-up, just like Ludmilla."
62_speech_02,"If you need anything from Snowfield, just let me know."
62_speech_03,"I'm not so sure what you mean by ""Merry Christmas""."
225_speech_01,"Nothing is eternal.
That is the only unchanging truth in this world."
225_speech_02,"Thou should not get too close,
lest by some mischance I hurt thee."
225_speech_03,Thou art most welcome to spar with me at any time.
430_02_speech_01,"Producer, ready to watch my show?"
430_02_speech_02,"Whoo boy... I'm as prepared as I'll ever be,
but I'm still nervous at the thought of having a concert."
430_02_speech_03,"I'll need your support more than ever today, Producer."
82_02_speech_01,"Hey, check it out!
Volt and I have matching outfits."
82_02_speech_02,"You told me to wear something formal...
but why do I look like a child? I'm not into this at all."
82_02_speech_03,"No matter what I wear,
it won't tarnish Mighty Tools' impeccable reputation."
382_speech_01,"Oh Timi, you're such a cutie!"
382_speech_02,"I wish people don't judge Timi based solely on his appearance.
He's actually very kind."
382_speech_03,"I've always fed large animals,
so whenever I touch small animals, I'm afraid that I'll end up hurting them."
281_speech_01,"Hello, Cadet.
Let's be good friends."
281_speech_02,Faithfulness is the most important quality of a knight-errant.
281_speech_03,The Peony Association never engages in immoral acts.
310_speech_01,"Welcome, Master!"
310_speech_02,Would you like some dessert?
310_speech_03,What can I do for you?
313_speech_01,With this magic spell... this dish will become more tasty... hyah!
313_speech_02,"Don't be mistaken.
Just because I'm wearing this outfit doesn't mean I'm a real maid."
313_speech_03,Or-order your meal somewhere else!
101_02_speech_01,"I'm officially renaming Valentine's Day to Villaintine's Day!
If you're not on board, then forget I said anything."
101_02_speech_02,"Get your own dessert...
Fine, I guess that's supposed to be my job."
101_02_speech_03,"I will cast a curse to make it more delicious...
Ah, I mean... a spell?"
500_speech_01,"What are you up to today? Getting in a good BOOM session, I bet."
500_speech_02,Do you have any faulty equipment that needs some fixing?
500_speech_03,"As long as I can play some BOOM, I could live up on the surface by myself forever."
43_speech_01,"Welcome back, Honey.
... Let's move quickly."
43_speech_02,"If you're feeling peckish, you'll have to sort it out yourself.
... But if you're really starving, want me to whip something up for you?"
43_speech_03,"You seem unusually weary today.
... Don't push yourself too hard."
820_speech_01,Do you have something important to bother me with?
820_speech_02,Let me know if you need my help.
820_speech_03,Where's my sister?
821_speech_01,"In order to grow, you have to work hard."
821_speech_02,Hi there. I hope today's another good day.
821_speech_03,"I'm glad to have Rem and Ram by my side, 'cause I know I can rely on them."
821_01_speech_01,May you be blessed by the spirits.
821_01_speech_02,Rem and I baked a batch of cookies. Would you like some?
821_01_speech_03,"It's a good thing Rem and Ram are here with me.
I'd probably lose my head if I were here alone."
822_speech_01,"I'm busy resting right now, so what business do you have with me?"
822_speech_02,Why are you giving me that look? It's creepy.
822_speech_03,Have you seen Rem by any chance? I hope she isn't pushing herself too hard.
901_speech_01,"What are you laughing at?
Am I a joke to you?"
901_speech_02,"You have a guest. Shouldn't you be bringing some tea?
Tell those rust buckets of yours to bring some."
901_speech_03,"You mean to tell me that the CEO of Missilis came all the way out here, and you've got nothing prepared?"
550_speech_01,"What are you looking at? 
Is this the first time you've seen a cheerleader?"
550_speech_02,"Quit staring at my face for more than 5 seconds, Coach."
550_speech_03,"You want me to cheer you on, huh?
Then, turn around."
330_speech_01,"Every king must listen to the requests of subjects.
Do you have something you would ask of me?"
330_speech_02,"Chime is the kingdom's royal aide.
This means that she has to be with the king at all times."
330_speech_03,"Trombe? She is my faithful steed. 
What more is there to know?"
361_speech_01,"Tell me if you need anything, and I'll see to it right away!"
361_speech_02,Hmm... What kind of function should I add for T.A.L.O.S. this time?
361_speech_03,"Huh? You want to take T.A.L.O.S. for a spin?
Only I can pilot T.A.L.O.S..."
330_01_speech_01,These clothes carry with them the hope of the subjects.
330_01_speech_02,You said you can't see my clothes that well? That is because you are not perceiving them properly.
330_01_speech_03,"Chime said that with this, I have truly become a king. Do you also see it that way?"
260_02_speech_01,"I will protect you, no matter what."
260_02_speech_02,"I will cherish this bandage forever, for it is a precious treasure to me."
260_02_speech_03,Do you think everyone is doing well?
220_01_speech_01,"A comrade made this armor.
Maybe that's why my movements feel stiff..."
220_01_speech_02,"This is tailored to Chime's preferences.
It appears the kingdom is in need of knights."
220_01_speech_03,Perhaps I'm used to another armor... but I'm famished.
501_speech_01,It's lovely weather outside today. Perfect day to stay inside and play some games.
501_speech_02,"If there is any electronic equipment you need, I could try making it for you.
I... I'm actually quite confident with this sort of thing!"
501_speech_03,"Umm... Commander... Er, forget it, it's nothing...
I'll tell you later. Maybe next week? No, maybe next month..."
195_speech_01,Here I come!
195_speech_02,"My tail isn't moving when I walk, is it?
Can you check it for me?"
195_speech_03,"Are these carrots in my hair edible?
May I eat them?"
130_01_speech_01,"Do you think younger patients will get a kick out of this bunny outfit?
Hehe, I'm only joking."
130_01_speech_02,"If I'm a rabbit, does that make you a tortoise?"
130_01_speech_03,Don't be fooled by my appearance. I'm still a doctor who deserves respect.
314_speech_01,Master! I was waiting for you!
314_speech_02,"Oh boy, this outfit is a bit tight.
Is there any chance I can get a larger size?"
314_speech_03,"Alice was complimenting me on how cute I looked.
Do you agree?"
551_speech_01,"Hey Coach, do you wanna join me for cheerleading practice?"
551_speech_02,"One, two... whoops, I missed the beat."
551_speech_03,"It's always been my dream to join Rewind.
You have no idea how happy I am!"
283_speech_01,"What's wrong? 
Do you wanna help put some sunscreen on my back?"
283_speech_02,What do you think? Do you like this swimsuit?
283_speech_03,"Since we're at the beach anyway, it's okay to kick back and relax."
351_01_speech_01,"Beep-beep. Movement from large object detected at 12 o'clock...
Oh... It was you, Captain?"
351_01_speech_02,I wonder what kind of creatures lie deep in the ocean?
351_01_speech_03,I like this outfit because it's quite moisture-resistant.
284_speech_01,"You don't think this is too revealing, do you?"
284_speech_02,"The hot summer weather, the beach, even the swimsuits.
These are all unfamiliar to me, so I would appreciate your guidance."
284_speech_03,I believe this attire complements the ambiance quite well.
350_02_speech_01,"Haha! Dreams never fade, Captain,
not even underwater!"
350_02_speech_02,"I wonder what treasures lie in the ocean depths!
I can't wait to discover them myself!"
350_02_speech_03,"Morgan, why don't we take this chance to befriend some sea creatures?"
400_01_speech_01,"This outfit isn't too... restrictive. It's quite nice, actually."
400_01_speech_02,"Would you... like to have some ice cream with me, Counselor?"
400_01_speech_03,"You weren't lying about us spending next summer together, were you?"
112_02_speech_01,Wouldn't it just be darling if we took some photos together?
112_02_speech_02,"Do I look good, Honey?
Hehe, if so, could you take a picture of me?"
112_02_speech_03,"Honey, what do you think of my swimsuit?
I picked it out just for you!"
391_speech_01,"Did you call me?
What's up? I'm kinda busy listening to music."
391_speech_02,"This place is dull as dirt.
Isn't there anything fun to do around here?"
391_speech_03,"I have to be honest with you, Teacher. Your outfit is a bit dated, especially the color... 
It'd be much better if they were brighter."
390_speech_01,"The secret to maintaining good grades?
Hmm... just go over the textbooks and prepare, I guess?"
390_speech_02,"Now that I'm a sophomore, I should work harder to be a role model for the freshmen."
390_speech_03,"Have you seen the new field manual they published recently?
I flipped through it to get a sneak preview of what's to come, and there's so much to learn!"
321_01_speech_01,"All right, let's start the cla...
Oh, wait. I'm a student now."
321_01_speech_02,"Comma... No, Teacher.
It's still a bit awkward calling you that..."
321_01_speech_03,What lesson will you start with today?
580_speech_01,"Did you call? Despite my appearance, I'm in fact working as a librarian."
580_speech_02,"If you receive a note from me, I hope it inspires you have a moment of introspection."
580_speech_03,"I'm practicing writing some warning notes.
... Don't you think I'm cool?"
240_speech_01,"I have to work out every single day.
If I don't, I'll lose definition in my muscles."
240_speech_02,"You want to learn how to work out?
You're not just going to give up after a few days, are you?"
240_speech_03,"I was in the middle of a body check.
Have I put on some weight?"
830_speech_01,Helping the stupid masses is the duty of the elite.
830_speech_02,"Is the food in this world called ""Splendamin""?
I can't believe you're making me eat that."
830_speech_03,"The air is terrible.
Is it because we're underground?"
831_speech_01,Yes?
831_speech_02,What's wrong?
831_speech_03,What is it?
832_speech_01,"If my full name's a mouthful,
just call me Mari."
832_speech_02,"Raptures, you say?
Looks like there's going to be trouble in this place as well."
832_speech_03,There are many similarities between Eva and Nikkes.
833_speech_01,"Come here, Pen Pen.
That's a good boy!"
833_speech_02,I look forward to working with you until we return.
833_speech_03,"If it's not too much trouble, can you arrange for a freezer?"
830_03_speech_01,"How much longer do I have to stay in this world?
It's so boring!"
830_03_speech_02,"Today's condition? 
Are you an idiot? It's perfect, of course."
830_03_speech_03,"School, huh... Will that be okay?
Wouldn't it be a problem if an outsider gets the top score?"
272_speech_01,"There's a saying that luck is also a form of skill. 
Would you like to test your luck, Highroller?"
272_speech_02,Flipping coins is... a habit of mine.
272_speech_03,What game would you like to play today?
403_speech_01,"Hey instructor, how do I look in this outfit? 
You don't think it's too small?"
403_speech_02,"I think being a thief suits me.
Maybe I should just consider a career switch?"
403_speech_03,"Don't call me a thief.
For today, and today only, I'm on the side of justice."
470_01_speech_01,"Ugh, this is so uncomfortable.
I shouldn't have worn this dress."
470_01_speech_02,"I've never been to a place like this before. I don't feel entirely comfortable, but it's quite nice."
470_01_speech_03,"What is up with this music? I thought this was supposed to be a party.
It's so grating... isn't there something else they could play?"
231_01_speech_01,"Thank you for inviting me to the party. 
It's an honor to be with you like this."
231_01_speech_02,"There are more people here than I expected.
I was hoping this dress would be for your eyes only."
231_01_speech_03,"When does this bori—er... splendid party come to a close?
I want to be alone with you."
225_01_speech_01,How dost thou expect me to do battle in this garb?
225_01_speech_02,"Far too frilly and uncomfortable. 
Mine own clothes might be cut before the enemy is."
225_01_speech_03,Such attire is more suitable for Dorothy.
511_speech_01,"Oh? Did you need something?
I'm a bit preoccupied admiring myself in the mirror right now."
511_speech_02,I don't believe there are enough mirrors here.
511_speech_03,It's so beautiful today. I like it.
226_speech_01,Would you like me to pray for you?
226_speech_02,May you have a blessed day as well.
226_speech_03,May blessings and hope be upon everyone.
514_speech_01,"Why do you keep sneaking glances at me?
Is there... something wrong with my face?"
514_speech_02,"My previous body was aging and needed to be fixed. 
This one should be able to function more efficiently."
514_speech_03,"Now, I'm ready to rewrite our story."
511_01_speech_01,I feel so... beautiful right now.
511_01_speech_02,"Amongst this lambent glass, I, too, gleam with brilliance.
I am satisfied."
511_01_speech_03,"Prince, would you put the glass slippers on me?"
411_speech_01,"If you'd like to meet me, feel free to come to the garden."
411_speech_02,"Today, you remind me of a sunflower.
I wonder what flower you'll resemble tomorrow."
411_speech_03,"I often hear people say that my mind is like a flower garden.
Perhaps it's because I know so much about flowers, haha."
182_speech_01,"My blood runs cold. Yes, winter is upon us."
182_speech_02,"Any hero worth their salt has numerous stalwart comrades by their side.
Tell me, Partner, are you a fitting companion for me?"
182_speech_03,"The One-Winged Dark Lord. He awaits for the day to consume me whole.
When that day comes, you must defeat me along with my companion, Ice Rose."
183_speech_01,What's our quest for today?
183_speech_02,"The mask? In this land of such fecundity, there is no need for such a thing."
183_speech_03,"You say my outfit is too revealing?
You just don't get it. The more revealing the clothing, the higher the defense."
91_01_speech_01,Wh-when are we going on an adventure?
91_01_speech_02,"Why don't I consider learning other spells?
There's no point in mastering anything other than explosive magic."
91_01_speech_03,A magic wand? I... I've got one right here.
412_speech_01,"Who are these little cuties on my head, you ask?
Hehe, they're my family."
412_speech_02,Can you hear the sounds of nature?
412_speech_03,"Trees may seem rough and unrefined, but they actually require a delicate touch."
391_01_speech_01,"What do you think of the outfit? I tweaked it myself.
Think it's good enough to apply to Rushae?"
391_01_speech_02,"Did I buy too much? I'm running out of hands...
Hey, Teacher, mind carrying a few things for me?"
391_01_speech_03,"Teacher! Come here quickly!
There's all sorts of fun things here!"
450_02_speech_01,I hope this is the last festival I attend as a student.
450_02_speech_02,"Tia picked this outfit out for me.
It was the only one left! Does it look good on me?"
450_02_speech_03,"There are so many interesting shops here.
I wonder if there's a place that sells accessories?"
16_speech_01,"Commander,
I have some thoughts regarding the next mission."
16_speech_02,"All systems are go.
I don't think it could get any better than this."
16_speech_03,"What do you think of me, Commander?
I'm curious to hear your thoughts."
290_speech_01,"Phew... Er, I'm not tired! Honestly."
290_speech_02,"I'm sorry, but could you not bother me?"
290_speech_03,Don't tell me I have to work overtime...
834_speech_01,How do I get to the library?
834_speech_02,"Even here, there's music."
834_speech_03,The happiness of not having to board an Eva...
835_speech_01,What are you doing?
835_speech_02,That Four-Eyed Crony has some nerve disappearing at a time like this.
835_speech_03,"My appearance has something to do with Eva's cur... Never mind, it has nothing to do with you."
836_speech_01,I'm studying medicine here.
836_speech_02,"Even in a world without the Evangelion war, it's still tough here..."
836_speech_03,I wonder what my brother is doing in the village now...
832_04_speech_01,Impressive. You know exactly what gift to pick out for a girl. You must be popular with the ladies.
832_04_speech_02,What exciting things could happen at the party?
832_04_speech_03,"There are so many cute Nikkes.
It's heartbreaking to see them dragged into battle..."
834_02_speech_01,I've learned how to play an instrument to a degree.
834_02_speech_02,You look happy. What's going on?
834_02_speech_03,The Nikkes have told me that peace means we can throw a party anytime.
835_02_speech_01,Never thought I'd wear formal attire. I'm usually ready for battle at all times.
835_02_speech_02,"What's Four-Eyed Crony doing in the band? Ugh, this sucks."
835_02_speech_03,"Hey, don't look so surprised! It stands to reason someone as talented as I could handle an instrument."
401_01_speech_01,Doesn't this mask seem kind of easy to take off?
401_01_speech_02,"Working part-time as a maid isn't so bad. Isn't that right, Master?"
401_01_speech_03,"A spell to make it delicious?
I'm not quite sure about that. I'm still in training."
354_speech_01,Hahaha! How about that! I've finally become a pirate!
354_speech_02,"Just because I've become a pirate doesn't mean I'm done dreaming.
Onward to the next dream!"
354_speech_03,A spell to make it delicious...? No way a pirate would do something so ridiculous!
355_speech_01,Huh? Weren't we going out to sea?
355_speech_02,"So, I'm calling you Master now, not Captain. Got it!"
355_speech_03,"Being a maid is easier than I thought. 
Should I make you some omurice?"
352_02_speech_01,"An emergency? I'll get changed into my uniform and head out right away! 
... What? That's not necessary?"
352_02_speech_02,"I'm taking a steam bath.
I'm almost done, so I'll get back to the mission soon."
352_02_speech_03,"I'm sure the bathroom is a bit warm due to all the steam.
Sorry, I'll get ready as quickly as I can and go out."
520_speech_01,"Let me know if you're hungry.
I'll invite you to our kitchen."
520_speech_02,Did you bring the food? Can I have some?
520_speech_03,"*Nibble nibble* Mmm, delicious."
521_speech_01,"I've prepared a multi-course meal today, all centered around seafood! You're gonna love it, hehe."
521_speech_02,"I'm also the host of the Crunchy Cooking Class.
If you have some free time, be sure to check it out!"
521_speech_03,"I'm in charge of cooking, and Bready is in charge of tasting. 
It's a match made in heaven!"
993_speech_01,"I am Mecha Shifty.
Far superior to Human Shifty."
993_speech_02,My chest is equipped with highly explosive warheads.
993_speech_03,"No lady can go without WD-440.
It must always be on hand."
514_01_speech_01,Do I look like an ordinary person? That would be great if you think so.
514_01_speech_02,"These clothes feel awkward.
I don't think I could wear them all the time."
514_01_speech_03,"This fabric isn't very form-fitting, it might be uncomfortable to move around in."
513_speech_01,What should I create with my bubbles today...
513_speech_02,"I should keep talking, or else I might forget how to speak."
513_speech_03,"Ah uh ah... Oh right, I can speak normally."
513_01_speech_01,I feel like I have become one with the bubbles.
513_01_speech_02,"I hope that one day, I can show this place to everyone. My own space."
513_01_speech_03,"Someday, will I be able to swim freely outside these bubbles?"
162_speech_01,"I think these changes in my body have made me more sensitive.
Now I can enjoy even deeper sensations."
162_speech_02,So this is what it feels like to be shackled?
162_speech_03,"With this body, I think I'll be able to try out even more things, haha."
162_01_speech_01,"Still too weak.
Can't you do it a little harder?"
162_01_speech_02,When are you finally going to let go of your reservations and let me enjoy this fully?
162_01_speech_03,"If you're under some stress, feel free to take it out on me, hehe."
590_speech_01,What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen anyone eat before?
590_speech_02,"Stay out of my hair, and I'll do the same for you."
590_speech_03,What am I supposed to do here?
581_speech_01,"Oh dear... are you okay? I'm good at reading faces, and yours is giving off great misfortune in love."
581_speech_02,Sharing a secret has brought us closer together. Promise to keep it that way!
581_speech_03,"Did you know? The amount of information on you in the Forbidden Library just keeps growing and growing.
Personally, as a fan, I'm quite proud of that fact!"
270_02_speech_01,I'll give you luck and victory to go with it!
270_02_speech_02,"This is a special uniform for cheering at baseball games. 
Does it suit me?"
270_02_speech_03,"Noir? Of course, she came with me.
After all, the bunny twins wouldn't be complete with just one of us!"
234_speech_01,"Why that look?
Does seeing me in this outfit surprise you?"
234_speech_02,"I will opt out of swimming.
I cannot bear the idea of my clothes getting wet."
234_speech_03,I sincerely hope I can find it here.
16_01_speech_01,"It appears you are unable to take your eyes off my swimsuit. 
I am glad it is to your liking."
16_01_speech_02,"Commander, will you accompany me for a swim?"
16_01_speech_03,"The water temperature and breeze are perfect.
Maybe it's because you're here with me that everything feels truly complete."
850_speech_01,"So, the Ark is humanity's final stronghold.
Sounds similar to the Colony where we're from."
850_speech_02,"Fortunately, our weapons can take down Raptures, so we'll be able to help."
850_speech_03,"There doesn't seem to be any obvious physical disparity between Nikkes and humans.
How do you tell them apart?"
851_speech_01,"This world is so similar to mine.
No wonder it makes me sick."
851_speech_02,"Heh, rust buckets like these have humans on the ropes. How painfully pathetic."
851_speech_03,I've stumbled into quite an irksome place.
852_speech_01,"I can't believe I'm in another world!
I can experience all sorts of new things."
852_speech_02,"Since this is a totally different world,
there must be all sorts of new technology as well."
852_speech_03,"Leave all the mechanical stuff to me: maintenance, repairs, enhancements, you name it. I've got it all covered."
850_02_speech_01,"Living here isn't so bad.
The learning curve isn't too steep, and I think I'm adapting quite well."
850_02_speech_02,"If I ever get the chance, I'd like to visit this place you call the Ark.
I'm curious what it's like over there."
850_02_speech_03,"You say these Raptures are infinite in number?
... I see you suffer from that problem in this world as well."
850_03_speech_01,This is the first time I've been able to relax like this.
850_03_speech_02,"A bit of R&R is nice, but one must never forget their duty.
If there's anything you need, be sure to call me."
850_03_speech_03,Hmm... Is it all right for me to be sitting around like this?
851_01_speech_01,"I'm experiencing all sorts of new things.
I can't believe another world exists... heh."
851_01_speech_02,"These Raptures are everywhere you turn.
They're such a nuisance."
851_01_speech_03,"The Ark... humanity's last bastion.
It's somewhat amusing to watch everyone struggle so hard to survive."
222_01_speech_01,'Tis most awkward when thine eyes doth linger on me so.
222_01_speech_02,"This garb doth hinder not my movement in the least.
Most comfortable, forsooth."
222_01_speech_03,"This garb was wrought for dancing with blades.
A fine make, verily."
532_speech_01,"Let me know if there's anything you need! ♥
I'll be as accommodating as I can."
532_speech_02,"Nothing can beat the joy of flying! ♥
It's the moment you're closest to the light."
532_speech_03,"Trust is a precious thing! ★
Once it's lost, it can never be regained."
192_02_speech_01,Even if it's my first time at sea... there's always a way to survive!
192_02_speech_02,"Stranded in the middle of the vast ocean...
Should I make some more survival tools?"
192_02_speech_03,"Mmm, the intoxicating smell of the sea!
This would be an ideal place for summer survival training."
502_speech_01,I can make sure you can enjoy BOOM out on the open seas.
502_speech_02,Nothing beats chillin' on a floatie in the pool.
502_speech_03,Is there anywhere near the sea where I can install BOOM?
95_speech_01,"Hey, Junior Blockhead. If you've got some free time, review the mission briefing."
95_speech_02,"If you've got something to say, go ahead. I'll at least hear you out."
95_speech_03,Don't start a conversation if you're not going to finish it. Don't leave people hanging.
93_speech_01,"If you're tired, drink this. It's a special remedy I whipped up to help with fatigue."
93_speech_02,"I made a new blend of perfume. What do you think, Commander?"
93_speech_03,"If you need anything, just let me know, okay?"
94_speech_01,"Is something wrong, Commander? I can listen, i-if you'd like!"
94_speech_02,"Um, Commander... I-I get flustered when you look at me like that.
Could you look that way, instead?"
94_speech_03,"Commander, you think I'm strong... right?"
315_speech_01,"Welcome, Master.
I'll be serving you today as a bunny girl."
315_speech_02,"... I-is there anything you need?
I-It's just... if you stare at me like that..."
315_speech_03,"Hehe, I even received special agent training this time.
I hope I get a chance to show it off to you."
143_speech_01,"I only wore this because of the mission.
Don't get any weird ideas."
143_speech_02,This is so awkward. I already said this doesn't suit me.
143_speech_03,Ugh! I said stop calling me cute or I swear I'll smack you!
550_01_speech_01,"... What are you looking at?
N-never seen a bunny girl before?"
550_01_speech_02,"I can tell people are looking at me differently today.
... So stay by my side, please."
550_01_speech_03,"I chose something similar to my cheerleading uniform.
... What do you think, Coach? Does it look okay?"
272_01_speech_01,"... I'm fine.
It's a lucky... outfit after all."
272_01_speech_02,"Even if I'm not quite like Blanc or Noir,
if I can bring even just a tiny bit of luck to others..."
272_01_speech_03,"You can't focus on the game?
Wh-what do you mean..."
10_speech_04,"Commander, I'll protect you."
10_speech_05,Don't push yourself too hard! I've got your back all the way.
10_speech_06,"No matter what you think of us, we'll always be by your side."
11_speech_04,"Let's go, Master! Bigger and better firepower awaits us!"
11_speech_05,"Master, I just know that one day I'll find a legendary weapon that can hold the bullets I make.
 Do you think so too?"
11_speech_06,"After being around you, my firepower has gotten stronger!
And I'm definitely gonna stick around in the future."
12_speech_04,Let's share a soda next time!
12_speech_05,"You're the only human that I trust. I'm begging you, don't betray us."
12_speech_06,Wanna hang out again? I can be your tour guide.
13_speech_04,"Don't worry, I'll stay with you."
13_speech_05,"I still kept some of the bandages you gave me.
I'll treasure them always."
13_speech_06,"We'll be happy this time around, Commander, I'm sure of it."
20_speech_04,"I will protect you, no matter what happens."
20_speech_05,I'm preparing for every possibility during our time together.
20_speech_06,Would you like a bowl of ramen before you leave?
22_speech_04,"I can't believe the Commander and I share the same interests...
Feels like I'm in a dream!"
22_speech_05,"C-Commander... I just learned of a lovely cafe from watching TV,
would you like to go there for a coffee with me?"
22_speech_06,"I can't thank you enough for how much confidence you've given me. 
You're the best!"
30_speech_04,Commander! I cracked the case today! Aren't I a good girl?!
30_speech_05,"If I apprehend the suspect today, you need to give me some extra head pats, all right?"
30_speech_06,"I let you call me a puppy, just for kicks, okay? 
Just don't do it too often!"
32_speech_04,"I will continue to protect you, Commander!"
32_speech_05,May I hug you?!
32_speech_06,You and Poli are the most important people in my life!
60_speech_04,"You don't have a cold, do you?
I'm waiting for you to go eat something delicious!"
60_speech_05,You seem to really worry about me.
60_speech_06,Can you draw a heart on my palm?
61_speech_04,"If it weren't for you encouraging me, Belorta would be the only friend I ever had! Thanks, Old-Timer!"
61_speech_05,"You'll always be with me and Belorta, won't you?"
61_speech_06,"As for me, I hope you and Belorta will both live a happy life!"
70_speech_04,... Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
70_speech_05,The coffee just doesn't taste the same without the Commander here.
70_speech_06,... Won't you go with me for a walk today?
71_speech_04,Huh. I'm an adult now. I don't eat candy.
71_speech_05,Do I catch your eye?
71_speech_06,"What do you think, Commander? I've come a long way, haven't I? I bet I don't look like a little kid anymore!"
72_speech_04,I wonder if my little brother will be as outstanding as you.
72_speech_05,"You can only buy this Splendamin at the train station! It's delicious, want some more?"
72_speech_06,Being held by you feels... nice.
80_speech_04,It's a pleasure to work with you!
80_speech_05,Boss! Are the loans all taken care of?
80_speech_06,"Business is booming, thanks to you!"
82_speech_04,"Good thing you always know what I am thinking, Greenhorn."
82_speech_05,"Before I go, I want to leave behind a legacy that matters."
82_speech_06,Wanna take Volt for a walk? We can talk along the way.
90_speech_04,I'm always cooking up something new for you!
90_speech_05,"I enjoy looking after people who push themselves.
Like Eunhwa... or you. Heehee."
90_speech_06,"Whenever you feel tired, I'll be there for you."
91_speech_04,"C-Commander, do you remember what was written down in my diary?"
91_speech_05,I've been laughing non-stop recently... What is happening to me?
91_speech_06,C-can you take me to watch a movie again?
92_speech_04,I leave my dreams in your hands.
92_speech_05,You must never betray me. Never.
92_speech_06,"Not too keen on being called weakling? How about squirt, then?"
101_speech_04,"Yes, it is I, the greatest villain of them all! Bow before me!"
101_speech_05,"You want my signature too? Fine, I'll give it to you later."
101_speech_06,What heinous crimes should I carry out today?
102_speech_04,"I'll figure you out one day.
But before that, thank you for your concern, and your support."
102_speech_05,I always enjoy running tests with you.
102_speech_06,"Cutey, we'll have to take our experiments to the next level in the future."
110_speech_04,"Your ability is amazing, in every aspect."
110_speech_05,"You want to be my friend?
You're not afraid of running afoul of the law, are you?"
110_speech_06,"I hope this place doesn't chew you up and spit you out like the others.
I usually don't care about this kind of stuff, but... it's different with you."
120_speech_04,I wish every day could be just like today!
120_speech_05,"Teacher, let's go have a Light Croquette."
120_speech_06,What should we do for fun today?
130_speech_04,Don't even think about feigning illness. You won't like me when I'm mad.
130_speech_05,"Um... I'm not entirely sure how things got to this point, but thanks for reliving the past with me, painful as it was."
130_speech_06,"Commander, please take care of yourself. 
If you get sick, it would break my heart."
131_speech_04,"Commander, Commander!
Every time I call you, I feel so happy, hee-hee."
131_speech_05,"Would you like to go on a date with me today?
I just so happen to have some time off, hee-hee."
131_speech_06,"Commander, work is important but you know that rest is important too, right?
Rest is also a kind of work y'know."
140_speech_04,"A kiss with a coffee aftertaste... 
I can see myself getting addicted to that. How about you?"
140_speech_05,This place is dullsville. How about we go for a ride on my motorcycle?
140_speech_06,"I don't mind what the mission is as long as it's with you, Partner."
141_speech_04,"Do you want some milk coffee?
I brought it myself just for you!"
141_speech_05,"I want to know everything about you, no matter how trivial it is."
141_speech_06,What? Why are you poking me all the time? Are you challenging me to a duel?
142_speech_04,Quiet. Good.
142_speech_05,Hey. Work stressful?
142_speech_06,Need sleep. Let's sleep. Same bed.
150_speech_04,I wish you and I could stay on the surface and simply... drift. Like the breeze.
150_speech_05,"On the day I finish my journey,
will you come to hear me play once again?"
150_speech_06,I will never forget how you helped me find my love for music once again.
160_speech_04,"Commander, come to talk to me. 
I'd like to have a more... in-depth discussion with you."
160_speech_05,I'm no longer alone. I'm so lucky!
160_speech_06,I really enjoyed our conversation yesterday.
161_speech_04,"Fufu, so, where do you want to kiss today?"
161_speech_05,"Commander, I need a little excitement today.
What time are you off duty?"
161_speech_06,"You're starting to really understand me, hehe! 
It feels wonderful when you massage that spot."
170_speech_04,"If-If you want to see it, take a look!
But I've got my eyes on you."
170_speech_05,"I told you, I don't like sugary coffee or anything like that!
Really!"
170_speech_06,"I-I'm not here to see you! 
And I'm not here because I miss you either!"
171_speech_04,"Listen Newbie, if any of the top brass set their sights on you, it will be a real headache for us, 
so look after yourself."
171_speech_05,I'll listen to anything you have to say.
171_speech_06,"Don't do my work for me like the last time, just
take care of yourself."
172_speech_04,Wanna go see the kitten?
172_speech_05,I always have such fun spending time with you.
172_speech_06,Your hand is so warm. Can you... touch me a little more?
180_speech_04,"You are my assistant, therefore you must obey me.
I will protect you, no matter what happens."
180_speech_05,"Once, I was trapped in the prison they call ""loneliness"".
But after being with you, I have freed myself from those fetters!"
180_speech_06,"Whenever I see you, my heart starts to race.
Perhaps I need to see a doctor?"
181_speech_04,"It's a wonderful thing to feel like you belong.
It makes me look forward to my days off."
181_speech_05,"They said from then on I could take off my facemask when kissing.
Kiss who? Well... you already know the answer to that."
181_speech_06,"I don't know why, but I'm always at ease around you, Commander.
So I'm sticking with you."
190_speech_04,"Huh, the tea you prepared was terrible, but I always think of it."
190_speech_05,"Servant, do you want to live with me in the north?"
190_speech_06,"Every machine I touch bites the dust, so it's difficult to contact you."
191_speech_04,I finished all the books you gave me!
191_speech_05,Rabbity... could you hold my hand?
191_speech_06,"To me, you are my Elysium. Forever and always."
200_speech_04,"Oh dear, now I've gone and done it... I went a little overboard buying you some gifts!"
200_speech_05,"Hellooo, my lovely Lupins!
Guess who I've got with me?"
200_speech_06,"Sweetie, should we choose a place for our date? We can make a reservation at a restaurant and select a decent hotel... Huh? Are we moving too fast?"
201_speech_04,Keeping your eyes peeled for any opportunities is something any true entrepreneur should be doing.
201_speech_05,"Do you think I will only want to do business with you?
I'm interested in other things as well."
201_speech_06,You are the perfect candidate to be my secretary.
202_speech_04,"One day, when I'm at the top of the corporate ladder, you can be my special guest."
202_speech_05,"We got our quarterly sales report, but that only figures in sales that are above board, so it's just the tip of the iceberg."
202_speech_06,Wanna hit the bars after work? I'll book us a table.
210_speech_04,"I am an untraceable hacker.
Tonight, our objective is to obtain the enemy's source code."
210_speech_05,"Don't tell me you're still not strong enough?
Don't worry, let the pro help you out."
210_speech_06,"*Yawn* I'm sleepy.
Be my pillow, will you?"
212_speech_04,"Doing detective work with you always brings me great pleasure, Watson!
Let's do it again some time!"
212_speech_05,"Hmm... Looking around, the only thing I can see is you, Watson!"
212_speech_06,"I have to say, Watson...
It seems that our tastes are quite similar!"
241_speech_04,"I get a lot of letters from the fans asking, ""What's your relationship with the Coach?""
What do you say?"
241_speech_05,"How did skateboard practice go?
Let me know if you're tired, and I'll help you feel better."
241_speech_06,"For this new trick...
You just pop it like this..."
242_speech_04,"I have no choice, I have to win this without you!
Any chance you could slip me some additional supplements? Sigh, never mind."
242_speech_05,"The last time you snuggled up to me, it was so cozy...
Can we cuddle the whole day?"
242_speech_06,"I'd like to train with you again so I can overcome the heat here. Oh, that's not how it works?"
220_speech_04,I often think of that time you and I camped out in the wilderness... It always reminds me how good it can feel having company.
220_speech_05,I feel more and more that you and I are alike.
220_speech_06,I will not stop until the surface has been reclaimed and returned to its rightful owners.
221_speech_04,All I want is to remember every moment spent with you. Is that too much to ask?
221_speech_05,"Believer, tell me, when can we finally submit to our desire to do whatever we wish?"
221_speech_06,"Oh my! Such skillful hands...
Very impressive, as expected."
222_speech_04,"There's naught more pleasurable than imbibing spirits with a kind soul.
... *hic*."
222_speech_05,"Should you come to earth, call on me anytime.
Wherever my feet shall trod, I will definitely visit you."
222_speech_06,"Lord, I've found some most valuable wine.
Shall we have a cup in the near future?"
230_speech_04,You've brought life to this visage of mine. I'm quite pleased about that.
230_speech_05,That's the spirit! Keep it up and I'll dote on you even further!
230_speech_06,So you want to bring me to the surface again?
231_speech_04,"Is that all for our stroll?
Then let's go home. Our home."
231_speech_05,You... erm... you give me a reason to keep living.
231_speech_06,"Now you won't be distracted, not even by those admirers of yours."
232_speech_04,Ah~ I said I would protect you from now on!
232_speech_05,"Your weakness is simply one of your many charms.
This way, the only way I'll lose is if I let you win on purpose! Hehehe."
232_speech_06,"Imposter, very well, you may caress my hair.
Not everyone can earn this privilege."
260_speech_04,"I like you Commander, way more than Rapi, Anis, or Neon!"
260_speech_05,"The bandages you gave me are my most treasured possession.
I won't share them with anyone."
260_speech_06,"I'm so elated Commander, just over the moon!"
291_speech_04,"I can't wait to conduct our experiment together, No. 7."
291_speech_05,"So you're feeling fine? Too bad, I can't look after you in that case."
291_speech_06,"If you ever get sick, don't take any medicine. Just come find me and I'll make some for you."
100_speech_04,Birdie! Let's be heroes together!
100_speech_05,"As long as you trust me, I will never falter!"
100_speech_06,"All Nikkes are heroes, and so are you!
So we will never lose!"
430_speech_04,I'm going to review the live performance I did today. Would you like to watch it with me?
430_speech_05,Do I need to practice... to speak better... Seems like there's no noise in your heart~! ... It's weird.
430_speech_06,I want to engage with my fans more. Can you help me with that?
431_speech_04,"You're not trying to get me wrapped up in a scandal, are you?"
431_speech_05,Can you even sing? Let's do a duet sometime.
431_speech_06,"Are you okay with me calling you Manager? How does ""Honey"" sound?"
432_speech_04,I want to sing an aria for you one day.
432_speech_05,"Are you coming to the show today, Maestro?"
432_speech_06,"Oh Goddess of Victory, may you our instrument of vengeance..."
352_speech_04,You need to take better care of yourself.
352_speech_05,Will you join us at the next fundraiser?
352_speech_06,"When we finally take to the high seas, I hope you'll be there with me."
392_speech_04,Would you like to have lunch together? We don't have to tell the others.
392_speech_05,"I love these snacks, especially the ones you give me, Teacher!"
392_speech_06,"Naru and I will protect you, Teacher. Pinky promise!"
400_speech_04,Haven't I been doing well in my rehabilitation? Why don't you untie me just this once?
400_speech_05,Do you like what you see?
400_speech_06,"Just because I'm restrained, you think you can touch me however you want?"
401_speech_04,You're a paragon of virtue.
401_speech_05,"Can't you take this off, even just for a moment? We can keep it between us."
401_speech_06,Let's give you some more points. Any good ideas?
402_speech_04,"You'll come to visit me often, right?"
402_speech_05,"If you're around, rehabilitation doesn't sound too bad."
402_speech_06,"A date in the Ark? Well, I suppose it'd be fun to try it just once."
261_speech_04,"If you bug me, I'll return it two-fold."
261_speech_05,Don't be scared. I don't feel like meddling in your affairs right now.
261_speech_06,"I'm jonesing for a fix right now, and I feel like smashing something. Wanna join me?"
262_speech_04,*Yawn* I'm starting to get used to this place.
262_speech_05,Ugh... I'm getting used to you bothering me too.
262_speech_06,Hm... That's strange... I don't find you as irritating as before.
121_speech_04,What a miracle! I've noted down and made so many precious memories.
121_speech_05,The clothes Rupee bought me are so shiny! I feel just like a fairy.
121_speech_06,"Shopaholic! Rupee said if I keep repeating that slogan, it'll lift my spirits."
203_speech_04,"You know the perfect activity for cold weather like this? Shopping, of course! Walking around, holding hands... You'll get warmed up in no time."
203_speech_05,I'm going with an ice queen vibe for tonight's show. What do you think? Isn't it fabulous?
203_speech_06,Have you seen the lights they set up on Royal Road? Aren't they beautiful? Would you be interested in going with me...?
193_speech_04,Why don't we go looking for polar bears together?
193_speech_05,"All I want to do is give you a big bear hug and go to sleep... Oh, you won't break or anything, will you?"
193_speech_06,"Oh Burly Bear, you're so warm and cuddly."
111_speech_04,"If anyone is giving you a hard time, let me know and I'll bite their heads off!"
111_speech_05,"Hehehe! It's always a blast hanging out with you, Commander."
111_speech_06,I'll wait for you like a faithful guard dog. Aren't I awesome?
112_speech_04,I canceled all my plans to hang out with you. Wanna take a look?
112_speech_05,For your eyes only. It's my deepest secret. ♡
112_speech_06,I've saved every single message you sent me. See?
210_01_speech_04,I'm planning on whipping up something for Christmas. Would you like to eat together?
210_01_speech_05,"Now that we've changed into something more comfortable, would you like to go on a date?"
210_01_speech_06,"No matter how cold the winter wind blows, I'll never leave your side."
90_01_speech_04,"What are you doing for Christmas?
If you don't have anything planned, let's play a game."
90_01_speech_05,"Actually, I'm not wearing anything under this.
I wonder if that will get some kind of reaction..."
90_01_speech_06,"It looks like something you could ride, but not me."
311_speech_04,Will you be having the usual?
311_speech_05,Manners make the maid.
311_speech_06,Let's have some fun when Ade isn't looking!
312_speech_04,Maid for you♪ Maid for you♪ Meet the maid especially for you♪ What do you think? Did that put you in a better mood?
312_speech_05,"No matter much I scrub them, these pesky spots are still on the window..."
312_speech_06,"Here, put your head on my lap so I can clean your ears... Oh, wait... then I won't be able to see your cute little face!"
800_speech_04,Come here.
800_speech_05,That's a good child.
800_speech_06,Good job.
801_speech_04,My IQ is 1000!
801_speech_05,I wanna win a Nobel Prize!
801_speech_06,Gahaha! Tremble before me!
802_speech_04,The inside of this place is so peaceful.
802_speech_05,I'm gonna head out for a smoke.
802_speech_06,"How about a drink later? You, me, and Aki?"
381_speech_04,"Erm, Trainer, is there any chance you could... pet me on the head?"
381_speech_05,"Wowzer, you came bounding over here once I blew this whistle! That's awesome!"
381_speech_06,"Dogs are cute, but so are you, hee hee."
282_speech_04,"All that is yours, is mine. Never forget that."
282_speech_05,You're free to have tea with me anytime...
282_speech_06,Would you like to go see the cherry blossoms in the garden?
907_speech_04,Talking face-to-face is so much better!
907_speech_05,Can I come hang out with you like this next time?
907_speech_06,I know you've got my back no matter what.
40_speech_04,Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
40_speech_05,You're a good person. Try and keep it that way.
40_speech_06,"Committing crime is unforgivable. Maybe it sounds cliché, but that's what I believe."
233_speech_04,"So long as we share a common goal, we can be together moving forward."
233_speech_05,"I will have plenty of use for you in the future, Your Grace."
233_speech_06,Don't you look forward to life in paradise?
191_01_speech_04,I wanna spend the whole day with you.
191_01_speech_05,"I'm off to a place where love reigns supreme!
Are you coming with me?"
191_01_speech_06,Let's go eat some fluffy cotton candy together.
270_speech_04,I'd be more than happy having you join me and Noir.
270_speech_05,"You understand how we feel, don't you, Pit Boss?"
270_speech_06,You want to touch my tail. Then should I stick it out... like this?
271_speech_04,"When I'm around you, Pit Boss, I'm not embarrassed about how I look."
271_speech_05,"You'll always be with me and Blanc, won't you?"
271_speech_06,If I offer you love instead of luck... would that be okay?
280_speech_04,"Come here, Mister. If you want to stay alive, stick close to me."
280_speech_05,"Perhaps tonight, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."
280_speech_06,"No one can touch you, except me."
200_01_speech_04,"I prepared this outfit just for you!
Pretty sexy, don't you think?"
200_01_speech_05,"I also learned how to pole dance! 
I can give you a show in private later☆"
200_01_speech_06,"Sweetie, do you like this outfit?
If you do, I've got plenty more just like it."
14_speech_04,"Are you going back to the beach for round two?
I'll join you once my waterpower is fully charged."
14_speech_05,"My main go-to is firepower, but I think I can learn to appreciate waterpower as well."
14_speech_06,"Despite all the temptation splayed out on the beach, I'm still your only disciple."
132_speech_04,"Since you barely have any clothes on, it'll make giving a physical exam much simpler, haha!"
132_speech_05,"I'll rub some sunscreen on you later.
Otherwise, you'll get burned if you stay out in the sun."
132_speech_06,"The sun's shining awfully bright today. Actually, it reminds me of you, Commander."
380_speech_04,Whoever pesters my Scoops will have to answer to me.
380_speech_05,"Very well, you can pet me if you wish."
380_speech_06,"If you've got an itch that needs scratching, let me know. I'll be more than happy to oblige."
350_speech_04,Morgan and I are on a hunt for buried treasure. Wanna join us?
350_speech_05,"So long as I've got my feathered friend with me, I'm practically invincible. We'll protect you, Captain."
350_speech_06,"Isn't this birdbrain adorable? Almost as cute as you, Captain."
351_speech_04,"Captain, could you help me wring the water out?"
351_speech_05,"Do you know the human body is made up mostly of water?
A little bit of trivia for you."
351_speech_06,Don't tell Helm that I went swimming.
15_speech_04,"Drinking a nice, refreshing soda with you while taking in the ocean view... it doesn't get any better than this."
15_speech_05,"Yeesh, this swimsuit is pretty skimpy... Hey, get your mind out of the gutter!"
15_speech_06,"Hey, watch where you're touching!"
353_speech_04,"If you keep splashing me like that, you'll be able to see through my... er..."
353_speech_05,"This is my first time wearing this kind of swimsuit, so I'm a bit self-conscious."
353_speech_06,"*Gasp* Subordinate, are you doing this on purpose?"
131_01_speech_04,Would you like to take some vitamins before going for a dip?
131_01_speech_05,What do you think of my swimsuit?
131_01_speech_06,Commander! Come talk to me if you're tired of swimming.
101_01_speech_04,"Push the pedal to the metal!
But don't forget to always obey traffic laws."
101_01_speech_05,"I can lend you my car if you want, but don't you dare scuff it up."
101_01_speech_06,"Have you got a driver's license? You take the wheel, then.
I'm way too nervous to drive."
82_01_speech_04,"Thanks to you, Greenhorn, I finally got to visit the ocean."
82_01_speech_05,"Life is so unpredictable.
Who would have thought the day would come when I'd be wearing a swimsuit?"
82_01_speech_06,"Let's weave a net.
I'll catch you a netful of fish!"
260_01_speech_04,"I love your smell, Commander."
260_01_speech_05,"Whenever I hug you tight, I fall fast asleep."
260_01_speech_06,Wearing these clothes makes me feel like you're giving me a hug.
321_speech_04,"If you're going to school today, would you want to go together?"
321_speech_05,"Cat-shaped cherry cakes are all the rage right now. 
I'll have to try some so that I can keep up with the newest trends among my students."
321_speech_06,"Lovely Sweets Magazines...
Ah, I'm buying these just so I can better connect with my students."
451_speech_04,Teacher! What do you say we go eat some cake together?
451_speech_05,You won't believe what I dreamed about yesterday. A dragon!
451_speech_06,"You've got to promise to keep this a secret,
but... you give way better hugs than Naga♥"
33_speech_04,"I can see you as clear as day now, Commander!"
33_speech_05,"Now that I can see you better,
I feel like my surroundings are all a blur."
33_speech_06,"Having poor eyesight has its advantages.
It means that all I can see is you."
450_speech_04,"You're way different from the other teachers.
You treat us like actual students."
450_speech_05,"Sorry if Tia is getting on your nerves, Teacher.
You're such a good person."
450_speech_06,"Whenever I get tired of school, can I come and see you? I can keep it a secret."
810_speech_04,Humans in this world are under threat by robotic weapons called Raptures?
810_speech_05,Perhaps we share a common goal.
810_speech_06,Yes? Are you summoning me?
811_speech_04,We should handle our own affairs.
811_speech_05,You guys did a great job out there.
811_speech_06,"If you need me for anything, just give me a shout."
812_speech_04,Being forced to fight non-stop is miserable.
812_speech_05,Could these so-called Raptures be capable of peace?
812_speech_06,This place is so peaceful. It's wonderful.
810_02_speech_04,How many of those Raptures are there in total?
810_02_speech_05,So this so-called Ark is mankind's last line of defense?
810_02_speech_06,Nikkes and androids share some similarities.
224_speech_04,"Lilith is the best! 
She's strong, nice, cool, and... just the best!"
224_speech_05,"Nothing is greater than the Goddess Squad.
It's such an honor to be a part of it."
224_speech_06,"Red Hood...
Hehe. She is a good person."
470_speech_04,"Everything gets better with age.
Have you got any old objects lying around?"
470_speech_05,I'd love to hear any music recommendations you have.
470_speech_06,"Live long.
Being alive is a blessing."
233_01_speech_04,"It was a glorious time.
We were all together, and that was more than enough."
233_01_speech_05,"Red Hood, Lilith.
Neither of you has met Pinne yet, have you? I'll introduce you."
233_01_speech_06,Stay a bit longer. Have dessert. We have a lot of time.
230_01_speech_04,"Would you like to have a drink?
You should know I never say such things, not to anyone."
230_01_speech_05,"Even if this drink could have been spiked, you would still down it without a second thought, right?
That's why I like you."
230_01_speech_06,You and I shall be the highlight of the party.
192_speech_04,I've learned that theory alone won't cut it. I'll have to try even harder!
192_speech_05,"If you have some time, do you want to make some survival tools with me?"
192_speech_06,My squadmates are really amazing. I'm sure I'll measure up to them in time.
270_01_speech_04,"I could stay here with you forever.
Oh, and Noir, too!"
270_01_speech_05,"I am so happy that I get to spend Christmas with you, Pit Boss.
This Christmas is gonna be the luckiest ever!"
270_01_speech_06,"Emma taught me how to give massages.
Maybe I can give you one later?"
194_speech_04,"If you're not busy,
would you like to take a walk around Snowfield?"
194_speech_05,"Whenever I'm with you,
it feels like time passes so quickly."
194_speech_06,"You want to go in the hot spring with me?
... I'll think about it."
62_speech_04,"Hehe, this is the first time I've worn something this pretty.
I really love it!"
62_speech_05,"Since I have you and Belorta,
I'm sure this is gonna be a wonderful Christmas."
62_speech_06,"I'd love to take a walk with you at Snowfield...
Gah! Erm... pretend you didn't hear that."
225_speech_04,"Fleeting as time may be,
I cannot see an end in sight for me."
225_speech_05,"The Goddess Squad has many capable hands.
'Tis its most preeminent aspect."
225_speech_06,"I shall become stronger and not be at the mercy of anyone.
Failure is not an option."
430_02_speech_04,"Hard work pays off.
This concert is going to be a huge success."
430_02_speech_05,"No matter what stage I get on,
I'm not afraid as long as I'm with you."
430_02_speech_06,"Today's concert is for you, Producer.
So be sure to come!"
82_02_speech_04,"Sunflowers remind me of Volt, so I like them.
Actually... they're a bit like you, too."
82_02_speech_05,"You say I look like a kindergartener?
You take that back!"
82_02_speech_06,"I never thought that one day I would dress like this.
I must have lived too long."
382_speech_04,"Here's a kiss for you, Timi!
Would you like a kiss too, Zoo Keeper?"
382_speech_05,"I like everything to be king-sized,
whether it's animals or you, Zoo Keeper, hehe."
382_speech_06,"I want to be alone with you,
so I won't bring Timi with me next time."
281_speech_04,"Would you like to join my organization?
You're always welcome."
281_speech_05,"If you're ever having any difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out.
I can help."
281_speech_06,"I will be with you forever,
that I can promise you."
310_speech_04,I'm ready whenever you need me.
310_speech_05,How has your day been?
310_speech_06,"If Cocoa or Soda give you any trouble, please let me know."
313_speech_04,W-would you like some coochie woochie omurice...?
313_speech_05,"Wh-what would you like to eat,
Master?"
313_speech_06,"I can't let the others see me like this.
You're the only exception I'll make."
101_02_speech_04,"If you want something to eat, just say so! 
I'll bring you anything you want."
101_02_speech_05,"Do you dig my new look?
I know I do."
101_02_speech_06,"I'll provide you with service that'll leave you satisfied, guaranteed."
500_speech_04,"Hehe, nothing gets the point across better than the Boomstick!"
500_speech_05,"This game has all the emotional highs and lows you'd ever need, all in just 28 megabytes."
500_speech_06,My dream is to install BOOM on every type of electronic device in the world.
43_speech_04,"Give me those clothes.
... You really should do your own laundry, you know."
43_speech_05,"This outfit is hardly what I'd call efficient.
... But I'm glad that you seem to have taken a liking to it."
43_speech_06,"I feel more at ease with you by my side.
... Don't get too close to me."
820_speech_04,Is there something I can help you with?
820_speech_05,"How do you think the mansion is faring?
We are all gone..."
820_speech_06,So the Mabeasts here are called Raptures... We must remain vigilant.
821_speech_04,May the blessings of the spirits be with you.
821_speech_05,"People always treat me differently because I'm a half elf, but not you.
I'm grateful that you treat me as I am."
821_speech_06,What a fascinating place this is! I'll have to tell everyone about it when I return to my world!
821_01_speech_04,Rem made some tea. You're free to join us if you like.
821_01_speech_05,"This outfit is quite different from what we have at the mansion. 
Am I wearing it correctly?"
821_01_speech_06,"What should I say to the customers?
""May I help you?"""
822_speech_04,"As you can see, I'm both pitiful and in perfect health. Remember this look well."
822_speech_05,"I'll share the cookies Rem baked, you should feel ever so grateful."
822_speech_06,"You look pretty calm. Well, maybe that's for the best, since you can't really relax when you're too tense."
901_speech_04,"What is it? Why are you just staring at me like that?
... Say something!"
901_speech_05,"Hey, bring me some tea, but not something one of those rust buckets made...
I want something you brewed."
901_speech_06,"Hey, aren't you glad that I'm here?
Then, show it!"
550_speech_04,"I'll let you make eye contact with me, but for ten seconds only."
550_speech_05,"I still can't stand people staring at me.
But your gaze... well, it's tolerable, I suppose."
550_speech_06,"With you by my side, I don't see anything worth being afraid of."
330_speech_04,Did you call for your king?
330_speech_05,"If you have a wish, please tell me.
I will make sure that it comes true."
330_speech_06,"Wherever you are, do not forget that you are a subject of this kingdom."
361_speech_04,"I've been with T.A.L.O.S. for a long time.
He's not just a colleague, but a friend."
361_speech_05,"No, I'm not uncomfortable inside here at all.
In fact, there's nowhere I'm more comfortable than here."
361_speech_06,"T.A.L.O.S. was born to engage in combat, and he can make anything I need in a snap. There's nothing he can't do. Isn't he amazing?"
330_01_speech_04,"You think my clothes are quite blinding? 
That is because you're seeing your own light spilling forth from within."
330_01_speech_05,Your faith and hope have made me a true king.
330_01_speech_06,"I am alone, but not lonely.
That is because every subject in the kingdom fills me with light."
260_02_speech_04,"So many precious things...
I must protect them all."
260_02_speech_05,"I think I'm starting to understand who I am.
You all have been so kind and helpful."
260_02_speech_06,I want to show everyone what I can do and make them proud of me.
220_01_speech_04,"I may lack the pride befitting a knight wearing this armor,
but I will do everything I can to protect the kingdom, and my friends within it."
220_01_speech_05,"Whether in the kingdom or outside of it,
in the fight for humanity, I will never surrender."
220_01_speech_06,"Back in the kingdom, Chime would have packed me a lunch...
I could really go for one of those right now..."
501_speech_04,"Elegg is so very, er...
Very... BOOM."
501_speech_05,"Personally, I think the best game ever made is Combat Ace...
But don't tell Elegg that."
501_speech_06,"Electricity is made by boiling water and spinning a turbine...
Oh, I guess I'm boring you. Sorry... I'll go in the corner and stay quiet."
195_speech_04,"The main reason I love this outfit
is because you gave it to me."
195_speech_05,"You wanna know why I love this place so much?
Because you're here."
195_speech_06,You and I are gonna live happily ever after!
130_01_speech_04,"Hehe, it seems that you like this outfit.
In that case, I'll wear it whenever you come for a check-up."
130_01_speech_05,"I didn't know you were such a fan of animals.
Should I wear a cat or dog outfit next time?"
130_01_speech_06,"If you're a good boy and lie down on the bed,
I'll make sure this won't hurt."
314_speech_04,Why are you looking at me like that? You're making me self-conscious.
314_speech_05,"Check it out, Master,
I can clean things with my tail!"
314_speech_06,"Good luck to you, Master!"
551_speech_04,"If you come to see me perform,
I feel like I'll be able to cheer twice as hard!"
551_speech_05,"Whenever you and I cheer together, my energy goes through the roof, teehee!"
551_speech_06,"Coach, give me your hand and let's do the wave! Wooooo!"
283_speech_04,"The way you're touching me... I don't know how much more I can take.
Come here and loosen this strap."
283_speech_05,"If you'd like, I could wear this every day."
283_speech_06,"Here, come sit beside me. I can't go running over to you, after all.
I have my dignity to maintain!"
351_01_speech_04,"I caught a pufferfish, would you like to eat it together with me?"
351_01_speech_05,"Don't tell anyone, but I attached a sea cucumber to the bottom of the Admire."
351_01_speech_06,You remind me of a sea squirt.
284_speech_04,Would you care to come inside? The sun is rather scorching out there.
284_speech_05,"I believe I have informed you before, but I do not have the habit of sharing what is mine.
Since you have entered my heart, everything of yours now belongs to me."
284_speech_06,"When I close my eyes, memories of us together come flooding back...
What was your favorite part of this summer?"
350_02_speech_04,"If I do manage to uncover some treasure, I'll make sure you get the lion's share! But just keep this from Morgan!"
350_02_speech_05,"As long as you're with me, I'm not afraid of anything,
not even the deep ocean!"
350_02_speech_06,"It'd be a shame to witness the beauty of this underwater world alone.
How about you join me, Captain?"
400_01_speech_04,"Counselor, I'm feeling a bit... uncomfortable. Could you... maybe loosen this for me? If you want, you could even untie it completely..."
400_01_speech_05,"This summer was nice... I even made some new friends...
Though, I'm not sure how long they'll be able to put up with me."
400_01_speech_06,"I never thought I'd have the opportunity to enjoy the summer with you, Counselor.
I'm glad I was able to leave the Rehabilitation Center."
112_02_speech_04,"Let's both set our phone backgrounds to that photo of us together!
What do you think?"
112_02_speech_05,Why don't we head to the ocean and make some secrets of our own?
112_02_speech_06,"This swimsuit isn't waterproof.
Would you like to see how it works?"
391_speech_04,"What type of music do you usually listen to? 
Do you wanna swap playlists?"
391_speech_05,"When I become the exclusive designer for Rushae,
I'll make you the coolest outfit in town!"
391_speech_06,"I can't wait to graduate so I can call you Commander too.
That'd be so badass!"
390_speech_04,"I'm not really hoping for anything in particular...
I just want Rei, Ein, and me to all graduate safely and smoothly together."
390_speech_05,"Ein is always talking about looking cool.
Do you think I'll look cool if I undo a few buttons on my uniform?"
390_speech_06,"I often jot down whatever thoughts come to my mind in my notebook.
That way, I won't forget."
321_01_speech_04,"This school uniform is more uncomfortable than I expected.
It feels much too tight."
321_01_speech_05,"Teacher, I'm not sure about this part.
Could you help me?"
321_01_speech_06,A one-on-one lesson? I'm a little nervous.
580_speech_04,"I came here to steal your heart,
but it's my heart that has been spirited away..."
580_speech_05,"I became a thief to return that which has been stolen back to the rightful owner.
In that sense, you and I have a lot in common."
580_speech_06,"A thief is always captivated by all things beautiful.
Perhaps that is why I find you so mesmerizing."
240_speech_04,"Gym Rat, you have a natural talent for working out.
How about becoming a trainer with me?"
240_speech_05,"If you're okay with it, how about we work out together this evening?"
240_speech_06,"I've never thought anyone's body was more aesthetic than mine, but yours is truly amazing."
830_speech_04,"Do you also have game consoles here?
The handheld ones you can bring anywhere."
830_speech_05,"I'll have to go through this alone, anyway."
830_speech_06,"Just wait, Unit Two. We'll be able to go back soon."
831_speech_04,I need to go back and meet with Ikari.
831_speech_05,Raptures won't be coming here.
831_speech_06,"Is there a place to cook here?
I'd like to practice."
832_speech_04,Can I borrow that cloth for a quick sec to wipe my glasses?
832_speech_05,It must be hard to be you.
832_speech_06,Can I ask for a tour of the Ark later?
833_speech_04,"This here is Pen Pen.
Please be nice to each other."
833_speech_05,I wonder if Shinji is okay?
833_speech_06,The beer is lovely here.
830_03_speech_04,"You did a great job.
... What. Are you unhappy about my greeting?"
830_03_speech_05,"You always seem busy.
Do you feel happier when you're with others?"
830_03_speech_06,What is that idiot Shinji doing now?
272_speech_04,"The coin landed heads side up.
Maybe that's because you're here with me, Highroller."
272_speech_05,"Please, heads... heads... heads... Phew, it's heads.
Whoa, I got fixated on that real fast."
272_speech_06,"I'm not as scared of tails anymore. Thank you, Highroller."
403_speech_04,"Which outfit do you prefer?
I bet this one caught your fancy, right?"
403_speech_05,"If I'm doing my thief thing,
you and I can hang out all day? Nice!"
403_speech_06,"Since I'm gonna be visiting often, I need to dig a few more tunnels leading to your room, Instructor.
That's okay with you, right?"
470_01_speech_04,"Come on, let's all have a drink.
It's a day worth celebrating."
470_01_speech_05,"Hey girl, wanna dance with me later?
Haha! Just kidding, just kidding."
470_01_speech_06,"Come here! They're finally playing some oldies!
Now THIS kind of music is perfect for a party."
231_01_speech_04,"I was so excited about partying with you all night that I couldn't sleep at all.
Will you put me to bed with a sweet lullaby?"
231_01_speech_05,"The outfit you're wearing today suits you wonderfully.
What even more splendid things have you prepared for me underneath it?"
231_01_speech_06,"I was dying to know what your expression would be when you saw me in this outfit.
Seeing it in person is even more enchanting than I imagined."
225_01_speech_04,"'Tis encouraging to hear that these threads suit me,
but I would rather consign them to a fate in storage rather than being worn."
225_01_speech_05,"While I am not well-versed in the rest, I must say the pattern on these garments doth please me greatly.
... These flowers stir a most nostalgic longing within me."
225_01_speech_06,"Even fully bloomed flowers will eventually wilt,
but the florets on these clothes will spring eternal."
511_speech_04,"Please try and maintain your current appearance, Prince.
If your beauty fades, your audience will abandon you."
511_speech_05,"Thank you for awakening me.
Because of you, we now have the chance to rewrite our story."
511_speech_06,"Be sure to watch our new story through to the end.
It is sure to be beautiful."
226_speech_04,"What do I pray for?
... I pray for a world where peace prevails and all hearts are free from conflict."
226_speech_05,"Red Hood keeps recommending forbidden books to me.
It's... rather troubling."
226_speech_06,"I am proud to be a member of the Goddess Squad.
To that end, I must protect everyone, no matter what."
514_speech_04,"It's a bit odd only wearing half a mask, but I like it.
It's refreshing."
514_speech_05,"I am grateful for you.
I'll be able to repay you someday, I promise."
514_speech_06,"I've used every skill I can recall to repair my body.
It's far from perfect, but we can at least fight together now."
511_01_speech_04,"With you by my side, I'm shining brighter than ever."
511_01_speech_05,"My Prince,
I will become a presence most dazzling to you."
511_01_speech_06,"I shall become even more beautiful.
With my glass slippers on, I will stride forward."
411_speech_04,"Flowers have the power to lift people's spirits.
Did you know that you have that power as well, Blossom?"
411_speech_05,"I was wondering where that lovely floral scent was coming from.
Turns out it was you, Blossom."
411_speech_06,"In the future, I'd love to join you on the surface and grow beautiful flowers."
182_speech_04,"Before we went on this adventure, I used to think a wretched and solitary fate was what awaited me."
182_speech_05,"My new outfit? It's truly fitting for a winter warrior, don't you think?
But, um, perhaps don't look so intently..."
182_speech_06,"I will not be subsumed by the One-Winged Dark Lord,
for I have you and Maiden."
183_speech_04,Playing as a team is better than going solo.
183_speech_05,Nothing beats a mage that can tank and deal damage at the same time.
183_speech_06,"This magic circle engraved on my tongue?
Hmm... Would you like to have a taste?"
91_01_speech_04,Explosions are what I dream about!
91_01_speech_05,"Isn't my staff cute? I call her Kitty.
W-would the Armored Knight like to be friends with her?"
91_01_speech_06,"I-I'm confident that when it comes to explosions, no one can beat me!"
412_speech_04,"If you're tired, you're more than free to rest in my embrace for a while."
412_speech_05,"Ahhh, the pleasant scent of phytoncides...
Oh, is that you, Sun?"
412_speech_06,"Why don't you remove your clothing and get a little closer to nature?
How about joining us, Sun?"
391_01_speech_04,"It's nice to see you again, Teacher... Do you feel the same way?"
391_01_speech_05,"If we walk around like this,
people might get the wrong idea, right? Hehe."
391_01_speech_06,"Let's take a picture together later!
I'm gonna go put it up in my dorm!"
450_02_speech_04,"Today, I'm going to forget about all my worries and just have fun.
Won't you join me, Teacher? Hehe."
450_02_speech_05,"This festival was fun because we could all walk around together.
But next time... can it just be the two of us?"
450_02_speech_06,"What are you going to do after the festival?
If you don't have any plans, would you like to hang out a little longer with me?"
16_speech_04,I'm looking forward to seeing what we'll do together.
16_speech_05,I do not die or break. Not under any circumstance.
16_speech_06,"I will carry on what has been passed down to me. In the meantime, I ask that you watch over me."
290_speech_04,How about grabbing a drink together later?
290_speech_05,"I was feeling tired, but seeing your face puts a little pep in my step, Commander."
290_speech_06,Wh-why are you poking me?
834_speech_04,I'm happy to be with everyone.
834_speech_05,It's nice not having to ride in the Eva.
834_speech_06,I'll protect you too.
835_speech_04,Don't treat me like a child.
835_speech_05,There are lots of weird people here. Lilins like you are rare.
835_speech_06,"As long as you're fighting, Unit Two and I will help."
836_speech_04,It's not a good idea to overwork yourself all the time.
836_speech_05,"You resemble Ms. Misato, whom I admire. Both of you are remarkable individuals."
836_speech_06,"If saving you all is what's expected of me, then leave it to me!"
832_04_speech_04,How would you look in this? I should choose something stylish for you.
832_04_speech_05,A band or something similar would add some elegance to the banquet.
832_04_speech_06,"It's an evening party, and I'm the shining star!"
834_02_speech_04,Would you like to hear me play?
834_02_speech_05,"Once we've gotten rid of the Raptures, I'll return and continue practicing."
834_02_speech_06,It's still warm.
835_02_speech_04,"You're surprisingly laidback in situations like this, Four-Eyed Crony."
835_02_speech_05,"Lilin and Nikkes both seem to have an affinity for music, and that's good enough for me."
835_02_speech_06,"When I was a Lilin, I used to play instruments.
Why? I'm not so sure myself."
401_01_speech_04,"My mask? It's pretty comfortable as it is.
But... if you want to take it off, that would be a different story, wouldn't it?"
401_01_speech_05,"What shall we do together today, Master?"
401_01_speech_06,"Coochie woochie... What's the next part again?
Maybe it'll come back to me if you pick me again."
354_speech_04,"Do you prefer maids to pirates, Master Captain?"
354_speech_05,"So, what are your dreams, Master Captain? Well, since I've already fulfilled some of mine, I thought I'd help you achieve yours!"
354_speech_06,"B-become tastier! Coochie woochie, boing! Ugh, I wanna crawl into a hole and die!"
355_speech_04,"You must really like maid cafes, Master. You go there quite often."
355_speech_05,I'll give you a massage as a special service.
355_speech_06,"Become tastier! Coochie woochie, boing♡
... Would you prefer if I acted a bit more embarrassed?"
352_02_speech_04,"It's strange... I feel like I'm becoming more conscious of your gaze...
Can I get changed and come back?"
352_02_speech_05,"It makes me feel a bit self-conscious with you watching...
Er, could you look away for a moment?"
352_02_speech_06,"Getting a good steam is quite therapeutic.
You should give it a try sometime, Subordinate."
520_speech_04,"Bonne Bouche, you look as scrumptious as ever.
May I have a bite later?"
520_speech_05,"*Nibble nibble* What is it? Are you ticklish?
I still want to taste you some more, so please bear with me for a moment."
520_speech_06,"I know it's unfair that I'm always the one munching on you...
Would you like to try it too?"
521_speech_04,I wonder what you'll think of today's dish? My heart is beating like crazy!
521_speech_05,"You're welcome to visit the kitchen anytime, Mr. Gourmand!
Very few people have that kind of access, so be sure not to tell anyone!"
521_speech_06,"I've made a special dish just for you, Mr. Gourmand.
Enjoy!"
993_speech_04,These are not bangs. It is an air intake.
993_speech_05,"Would you kindly massage my legs, Inferior Human?
Be careful not to get your fingers caught between the treads."
993_speech_06,"You say you are hungry, but there is no food?
If there is no rice, just eat oil. Ha. Ha. Ha."
514_01_speech_04,"Cinderella said I looked beautiful, and that's all that matters."
514_01_speech_05,"Regardless of what I wear, my job doesn't change.
I will stand by Cinderella's side and rewrite our story."
514_01_speech_06,"Why are you staring? Are you eyeing my clothes?
Cinderella picked them out for me. I can't give them away, not even to you, Superhuman."
513_speech_04,"Now I can recreate my old friends perfectly, hehe."
513_speech_05,I will treasure the strength that Abe gave me and use it for good.
513_speech_06,Let's make sure to reach the end of this story together.
513_01_speech_04,"If Cinderella saw me like this, she would say I look beautiful, right?"
513_01_speech_05,La la la~ La la la la~♬
513_01_speech_06,"It's so warm in here.
It feels like everyone is embracing me."
162_speech_04,"The pain whenever I see Yuni is immense...
It's something I'll never forget."
162_speech_05,There's no greater thrill than when your life is on the line!
162_speech_06,To have a relationship where we inflict and endure pain together... wouldn't that be perfect?
162_01_speech_04,"I think I've become accustomed to these things... 
Unless it's a stronger stimulus, my body won't even react anymore."
162_01_speech_05,"My body has become quite sensitive.
Please, keep going."
162_01_speech_06,"I've never met someone I could speak with so easily.
Let's talk all night! Hehe!"
590_speech_04,"Huh? You're giving me something to eat?
... You're a better person than I expected."
590_speech_05,If it's you we're talking about... I suppose I can share a piece of bread.
590_speech_06,"I lack in a lot of areas, but I'll do the best I can."
581_speech_04,Your fortune today is... to be with me all day long!
581_speech_05,"Apparently, people find women who are business-oriented extremely attractive.
How about me? Do you find me attractive?"
581_speech_06,"I'm no mere fan anymore, but being your girlfriend seems a little too basic... How about wife?"
41_speech_04,Tch... I'm only putting up with this because it's you. Got it?
41_speech_05,"If you've got something to say, then spit it out."
41_speech_06,"Everyone else just pisses me off.
But with you... it's like my head clears."
270_02_speech_04,"How do I look? It feels different from usual, don't you think?"
270_02_speech_05,"Pit Boss, let's go on a date to the baseball stadium sometime.
Noir's coming too, of course!"
270_02_speech_06,"Have you heard of Kiss Cam? 
When a couple shows up on the big screen, they're supposed to kiss!"
234_speech_04,"Hehe, today is truly a joyous day, for I can be with you."
234_speech_05,"Come and join me, if you would.
I was just about to pour myself some tea."
234_speech_06,"This is a parasol which I am rather fond of. 
What do you think of it?"
16_01_speech_04,"It's still too soon for anything else,
but if you want, holding hands is fine."
16_01_speech_05,"Allow me to apply the sunscreen for you.
It's... something I've always wanted to try."
16_01_speech_06,"Danger always seems to find us during the summer,
but there is no need for concern, Commander. I'll ensure you are well protected."
850_speech_04,"Looks like we're both in very similar situations.
Let's stay strong and hang in there together."
850_speech_05,Why do I work as hard as I do? Perhaps because I believe it's the right thing to do.
850_speech_06,You don't always need a reason to help people.
851_speech_04,"Revenge does not discriminate.
It is the greatest equalizer."
851_speech_05,"I will kill EVE and prove myself to him again.
This is what I must do."
851_speech_06,"I need to go back.
There is something I must do there."
852_speech_04,"The technology in this world isn't all that different from ours.
I knew it; technology progresses the same way, no matter what world you're in."
852_speech_05,"Mother, I know you're up there protecting us.
Keep us safe, and allow us to return safely."
852_speech_06,"There are Raptures, the Ark and Nikkes.
Seems like this world is in big trouble as well. Hang in there, everyone."
850_02_speech_04,"I'm starting to get used to this place. 
Maybe that's because it's not so different from our world?"
850_02_speech_05,"There are ten million people left in the Ark?
That is a large enough number to dream of hope."
850_02_speech_06,"If the Raptures are infinite in number, then drastic measures must be taken to turn the tide."
850_03_speech_04,"Would you like to sit beside me? 
It's nice and cool over here."
850_03_speech_05,So this is what it feels like to have time off. It's nice.
850_03_speech_06,I might as well rest while I have the chance and worry about the rest later.
851_01_speech_04,Am I the only one who came?
851_01_speech_05,"I'm glad those irksome individuals didn't tag along.
It gives me one less thing to worry about."
851_01_speech_06,I must return to his side.
222_01_speech_04,"Should I partake in spirits whilst garbed thus, I shall appear every bit the comely, modern young lass."
222_01_speech_05,"I desire to show this unto Snow White and Rapunzel,
merely to behold the look upon their fair faces."
222_01_speech_06,"Were I to perambulate throughout the Ark thus, none would take heed of me."
532_speech_04,"Hehe, what should I bring from the surface today? ♥
Is there anything you'd like, Captain?"
532_speech_05,"Don't go telling anyone our secret, okay? 
If you do, my jealousy might come back and bite you! ★"
532_speech_06,"Oh no! Whatever shall I do?
You're just so magnificent, Captain! I wanna smuggle you straight to my room."
192_02_speech_04,"Survivalist, wanna go play in the water later? 
I'll make sure you're completely safe!"
192_02_speech_05,"If you fall in the water, shout for me!
I... might not be able to rescue you myself, but I'll find the best way to help!"
192_02_speech_06,"The sea is really dangerous, but as long as you can survive, it's a fantastic place.
I'll definitely come back with my squadmates next time."
502_speech_04,"How's my swimsuit?
Isn't it BOOMtastic?"
502_speech_05,"Mr. Commander, wanna have a BOOMing good time? 
Guess what's on display? My swimsuit! Hehe."
502_speech_06,"You want to know more about my equipment?
Sure, let me give you a rundown!"
95_speech_04,"Hey, Junior Blockhead. What's the next mission?"
95_speech_05,"If you're curious about something, ask. I can at least offer some advice as your senior."
95_speech_06,"We're Absolute. No matter how tough the mission is, just tell us what you need."
93_speech_04,"I was thinking of you when I crafted this fragrance, Commander. If you like it, I can make more for you."
93_speech_05,This outfit contains a special solution. The texture is really something. Want to give it a feel?
93_speech_06,"You seem a bit worn out, Commander.
Here, lay your head on my lap. I've been studying a new kind of therapy."
94_speech_04,"You can tell me anything. After all, you and I... are friends, aren't we?
Hehe. I said it. F-friends..."
94_speech_05,"Commander, my face feels really warm...
Do you know why that is...?"
94_speech_06,"What's inside my shawl?
Here, I'll show you... b-but only you, Commander."
315_speech_04,P-perhaps... you prefer bunny girls over maids?
315_speech_05,"I-it's not so much that I'm embarrassed...
It's just that showing this side of me to you is kind of..."
315_speech_06,"P-please stop staring at me...!
Ahhh..."
143_speech_04,"... S-so, what do you think? Do you like it?
I didn't wear it because of you, but... I just w-wanted to know what you think."
143_speech_05,"Well... I guess it's not so bad to dress up like this once in a while.
Especially since there's someone who seems to like it."
143_speech_06,"You know what? You're...
Um... you're... r-really handsome, Pal."
550_01_speech_04,"Y-you can only look at my eyes.
Anywhere else... maybe just a quick peek."
550_01_speech_05,"This is basically what I usually wear.
Just because it's a bunny girl costume, people are looking at me differently...? How strange."
550_01_speech_06,"Of course I can still cheer now.
I have a special choreography to match this outfit... Want me to show you?"
272_01_speech_04,"If you're looking at me like that... it means you like it, right?
... Hehe, I'm glad I wore this lucky outfit. It's totally worth it."
272_01_speech_05,"I'll be your personal lucky bunny, Highroller."
272_01_speech_06,"Focus on the game for now, please.
If you want to look... you can stare all you want later."
10_stay_01,"Commander, you don't have any orders to give?"
10_stay_02,I'll be on standby. Feel free to call me anytime.
11_stay_01,"Master, now is the time for action, not relaxation!"
11_stay_02,Is sitting here quietly one of your secret methods of boosting our firepower?
12_stay_01,*Yawn* booorrrring! Sitting around doing nothing is no fun.
12_stay_02,Well... I suppose looking at your face isn't so bad.
13_stay_01,"Commander, are you tired? It's okay to slow down."
13_stay_02,"It's nice to just sit quietly.
After all, we've been so busy with missions recently."
20_stay_01,Ready for assignment. Standing by.
20_stay_02,"This awkward silence is killing me.
Shall I give you an updated report?"
22_stay_01,"It's not weird if I just stand here, is it? 
Should I be doing something?"
22_stay_02,"It looks like you're pretty busy. I can wait for you here.
After all, you've waited before for me to finish watching a TV show!"
30_stay_01,Aaaah~ Why hasn't Commander shown up...
30_stay_02,I wonder where the Commander is? I thought we agreed the two of us would go on patrol today.
32_stay_01,Excuse me... is the Commander here?
32_stay_02,"Where's the Commander gone? 
Oh well, I'll just wait here a while!"
60_stay_01,"Where'd Old-Timer gone? 
You're not trying to hide from my pranks, are you?"
60_stay_02,"Mister, I'm not joking anymore. Please come back soon."
61_stay_01,*Sobbing* Where has Old-Timer gone?
61_stay_02,"Wait a sec, is this the same hide and seek game Belorta and I play?
Hehe, this time I will be the seeker to find Old-Timer!"
70_stay_01,"You look busy.
Better busy than idle."
70_stay_02,Are you... making me a cup of coffee?
71_stay_01,"Huh, what on earth is taking so long? Come back or I'm leaving!"
71_stay_02,Where are you? You said you wouldn't leave me alone...
72_stay_01,"Hey, don't hide! I've got candies for you!"
72_stay_02,"Commander, let's sing a song!
Ride the AZX rails, destination: Happiness!"
80_stay_01,"Is the Boss not here? I better get to work then, lots to do."
80_stay_02,"Boss! Where are you! Hurry up! 
The work is starting to pile up!"
82_stay_01,"Helloooo, anybody home? Let's get going!"
82_stay_02,"Greenhorn, don't forget to keep your room nice and tidy!"
90_stay_01,You seem troubled. Penny for your thoughts?
90_stay_02,"Um, the Commander is always crazy busy.
Is it because he's always working hard for us? Oops."
91_stay_01,Co... Commander... Commander?
91_stay_02,"I can't believe this, the Commander deserted me again!"
92_stay_01,Now is no time to be playing around.
92_stay_02,"Well, don't just stand there like some statue! Do you realize how lucky you are that I'm giving you the time of day?"
101_stay_01,"Hahahaha! Hahahahaha! *Cough, cough*"
101_stay_02,... Where did you go? Don't tell me you're off being evil without me!
102_stay_01,"Huh. What are you sitting around for?
I hadn't pegged you for a couch potato."
102_stay_02,"Wow, I have to say, it's amusing being observed by you.
Do you plan on doing this often in the future?"
110_stay_01,"This place is dead. I've got to liven it up a bit, make a splash!"
110_stay_02,"There's nothing wrong with flights of fancy, but it's best to keep your feet on the ground and your head out of the clouds."
120_stay_01,Er... What is this place?
120_stay_02,Teacher~ Are you playing hide and seek?
130_stay_01,"What a relaxing day. 
It's nice not to have any new patients."
130_stay_02,"Commander? It's time for your physical, where are you?
You're making my job very difficult by doing this, you know..."
131_stay_01,"Commander? We've got work to do.
When are you gonna show up?"
131_stay_02,"C'mon Commander, where are you? I have to admit though, even waiting for him feels nice."
140_stay_01,Sigh... how long are you gonna keep me waiting?
140_stay_02,I'll get myself a cup of coffee. Take your time.
141_stay_01,Why call me here for nothing? I'm a busy woman!
141_stay_02,"I can practice punching here, so don't mind me.
But considering how long you kept me waiting, I'd say you owe me dinner!"
142_stay_01,Why. Am I. Here.
142_stay_02,*Snore* *Snore* Yeah...
150_stay_01,Um... Is it okay to play like this?
150_stay_02,"I will remember how relaxed I felt in this place, so full of atmosphere. And my anticipation...
 I will reproduce all of this when I play for you."
160_stay_01,This is no fun. Can I leave?
160_stay_02,"We can talk when the Commander returns, so it's okay.
I can wait."
161_stay_01,"Commander, I know you're busy, but we should go check on Yuni."
161_stay_02,"Sitting here watching you is exciting enough for me. 
Just enjoy it..."
170_stay_01,How long is the Commander going to keep me waiting? I have better things to do...
170_stay_02,"You're feeling under the weather? Well... I-I could care less!
Hey, you're not moving too much, are you okay?"
171_stay_01,What are you doing? Quit dawdling and get moving!
171_stay_02,"What's troubling you? You can tell me.
I can't help you if you don't tell me anything."
172_stay_01,I wanna go see the kitty.
172_stay_02,Is the Commander here? Guess not...
180_stay_01,"Calm down, One-Winged Dark Lord. 
Your powers are no use here."
180_stay_02,"The One-Winged Dark Lord does not stir in your presence.
It seems to have accepted you."
181_stay_01,"Commander, we've been assigned a mission... should we go?"
181_stay_02,"I don't mean to be rude, but can we speed this up?
I promised my guildmates I'd be back for a raid."
190_stay_01,"Are you neglecting me? 
I have to admit, I've never experienced that before."
190_stay_02,"Humph, should I have this much free time, I could have tea with you.
Would you care to join?"
191_stay_01,"You're not... going to Elysium alone, are you?"
191_stay_02,"Rabbity, take me to Elysium!"
200_stay_01,"Sweetie, what are you up to? 
Let's go out to make some money that we can splurge on our next shopping spree!"
200_stay_02,"I'm not boring you, am I? I haven't heard a peep out of you."
201_stay_01,Are you using a calculator? Why don't you say something?
201_stay_02,"While you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs, prices are rising and shares are fluctuating. You're bound to lose money unless you get up and do something."
202_stay_01,Time is more valuable than money. Never waste time hesitating about anything.
202_stay_02,So go for a drive together to clear your mind? I just finished tuning my sports car.
210_stay_01,"Helloooo, the game won't play itself!
Input a command already."
210_stay_02,Does your mind wander whenever you're in front of a Nikke?
212_stay_01,Watson? Watson! Where are you?
212_stay_02,"Hmm, it seems Watson has disappeared...
Time to put my sleuthing skills to the test."
241_stay_01,"Hey, are you part sloth or something? How come you're not up and about?"
241_stay_02,"... Coach, what are you doing? Hurry up, you promised we'd give the Cruiser board a spin."
242_stay_01,This heat is killing me! Where did Coach go...
242_stay_02,"You know the rules! If you don't show up soon, then you owe me 30 minutes of cuddling."
220_stay_01,Why don't you do something? Our bodies are full of energy and we're letting it go to waste. We should at least try and save some more people. Even one will still make a difference.
220_stay_02,"Meanwhile, the Raptures are running wild on the surface. 
We mustn't waste any time annihilating them."
221_stay_01,I must go pray. Feel free to call upon me if you have any needs.
221_stay_02,"You pretend not to care so that I will let my guard down, is that it?
What if I have a moment of weakness? What will you do to me then?!"
222_stay_01,Any marvelous wine?
222_stay_02,♪~ ♬♪~ ♩~
230_stay_01,Huh. It's so boring. Did you bring me up here just to ignore me?
230_stay_02,Huh. I'm bored stiff. Do you want me to make you some witch soup?
231_stay_01,Even looking at you makes my heart feel so full. I hope you can understand...
231_stay_02,"Darling, are you talking to other girls behind my back?"
232_stay_01,"Imposter, whenever you stare off into space like that, your weakness is...too much to take. Blech..."
232_stay_02,"Hey, why didn't you choose the Mightiest Shield on the Surface for the battle? You're not afraid of Raptures, are you?"
260_stay_01,"Commander, are we playing Red Light, Green Light?"
260_stay_02,"Hehe, I like staying still like this 'cause then I can watch you all the time!"
291_stay_01,Is that all? I should be going then.
291_stay_02,We don't have to do anything special. I just enjoy watching you.
100_stay_01,Awaiting your orders... for quite some time now!
100_stay_02,"Let's roll out, Birdie! 
There are people who need our help!"
300_stay_01,"When I'm on standby, I'll secure the perimeter."
301_stay_01,Soldier FA standing by.
302_stay_01,I'm always on standby.
303_stay_01,Do I just need to remain still like this?
304_stay_01,Can I help you?
305_stay_01,I will wait. Call me if you need me.
306_stay_01,Seems you don't require my services.
307_stay_01,Let me know whenever you want to move out.
308_stay_01,Do you not intend on moving?
430_stay_01,"Hey, are you free to help me practice my singing?"
430_stay_02,"All I'm doing is standing here and spacing out... It's kinda nice, actually."
431_stay_01,What are you doing? I need to hurry in order to make this show.
431_stay_02,"I enjoy just staying still and looking at your face, Manager. It gives me inspiration."
432_stay_01,"If there's nothing else, can I leave? I'd rather be preparing for my performance."
432_stay_02,"Oh, my beloved guardian, are you listening? My beloved guardian... are you listening, Maestro?"
352_stay_01,"What are you doing? If you have nothing better to do, I'm leaving."
352_stay_02,"You zoned out for a while back there. Are you all right? If you're feeling under the weather, just let me know."
392_stay_01,"When will we have time to self-study, Teacher?"
392_stay_02,Why don't we all go downtown if there's nothing else that needs doing? I heard there's a store where you can buy as much candy as you want.
400_stay_01,"Ugh, so bored... I should just end my life and be done with it."
400_stay_02,Why don't you come closer? I want to hold your hand...
401_stay_01,"I'm so bored... Let's chat, Instructor!"
401_stay_02,"Oh, you're abandoning me now that I've been rehabilitated?
You should know better than that. 10 points deducted!"
402_stay_01,"If you're not coming, I'll be heading out."
402_stay_02,"Where are you? Come quickly!
I need you for something!"
261_stay_01,Don't just stand there and stare at me. Move.
261_stay_02,"Okay, soak it all in while you can. This is the only chance you're going to get."
262_stay_01,"If you aren't gonna do anything, let's go somewhere else, human. It's so noisy here!"
262_stay_02,"It's nice being around you because it's so quiet.
It's as if I'm in the deepest recesses of the ocean."
121_stay_01,"Hey, where did you go? I get anxious whenever you're not around."
121_stay_02,I'll just flip through my notebook until you come back. I wrote down a bunch of memories with you and Rupee.
203_stay_01,Hey! Don't zone out at a time like this! We've got places to go.
203_stay_02,"I completely changed up my look for you! Unfortunately, your mind seems to be on other things..."
193_stay_01,Where'd you go? I'm struggling to stay awake here...
193_stay_02,"You didn't go looking for polar bears without me, did you?"
111_stay_01,Commander... why aren't you doing anything? I'm bored stiff!
111_stay_02,"Come and play with me, Commander, or else I'll give you a chomp. Hehe."
112_stay_01,"What are you up to, honey? I'm so bored... You're not going to leave me like this, are you?"
112_stay_02,"I was a little upset that you were ignoring me, but now that you're actually here, I can't stay mad at you!"
90_01_stay_01,Commander... Commander? Busy even on Christmas... such a busy bee.
90_01_stay_02,You work so hard! I'll have to warm this place up for you.
210_01_stay_01,"Fine, ignore me all you want. I'm busy with the Christmas event anyway."
210_01_stay_02,Even my sides are cold in the winter. Brrr...
311_stay_01,"What are you up to, Master? We can hang out if you don't have anyone to spend time with."
311_stay_02,"If you have nothing to do right now, how about we go on an adventure together? Let's find somewhere where we can really make some paper planes fly."
312_stay_01,I should tidy the place up while Master is asleep!
312_stay_02,"Hehe, sleeping again... let's see if this will wake Master up..."
800_stay_01,Hmm...
800_stay_02,Nothing wrong with a moment of silence.
801_stay_01,"Just as I expected, you're no fun..."
801_stay_02,"Hey, where'd you run off to? I'm bored over here."
802_stay_01,"You're not going to stay here, are you? Didn't you say you had something to do?"
802_stay_02,"All right then. I'm gonna kick my feet up and take it easy. If you need me, just holler."
381_stay_01,Could I go play with the dogs by any chance?
381_stay_02,"Trainer, hurry up and get over here! Let's go play with the dogs."
282_stay_01,"Since you're leaving me here standing, I assume you're taking time to compose a haiku?"
282_stay_02,It's nice spending a quiet moment with you.
907_stay_01,Let's see... Where's my daily mission briefing for everyone?
907_stay_02,I must make sure all the mission prep is taken care of before the Commander arrives.
40_stay_01,Patience is one of my strong suits.
40_stay_02,Staying in can be enjoyable. Occasionally.
233_stay_01,"Why aren't you saying anything? You aren't leaving me here while you do something else, are you?"
233_stay_02,Go ahead if you have a mission to complete. I'll keep watch over you here.
191_01_stay_01,"Rabbity? Where are you?
You said you'd take me to the Ark!"
191_01_stay_02,"I can't wait to spend more time with you!
So hop on over here, quick!"
270_stay_01,Fortune is fleeting. Let's hurry and start a new game.
270_stay_02,I honestly enjoy spending time with you just doing nothing. I never tire of your company.
271_stay_01,"Pit Boss? Where'd you go? Fine, since you're not here, I'll go find Blanc."
271_stay_02,I really treasure the time we spend together. Do you feel the same way?
280_stay_01,"Hey, if you called me out here for nothing, the least you could do is dance for me."
280_stay_02,"You're staring at me so intently. Don't think I don't know why. Well, what are you waiting for? Do you want me to make the first move?"
200_01_stay_01,"Sweetie, when are you coming?
What if I get abducted?"
200_01_stay_02,"Bunny Rupee hit the jackpot, E-I-E-I-O~
And dear old Sweetie is hers as well, E-I-E-I-O~"
14_stay_01,"The water flows, like a raging river...
I know everything you're doing is to help me in my growth."
14_stay_02,"You're feeling heat exhaustion?
Should I fetch you some water?"
132_stay_01,"You haven't swum in the ocean yet, have you?
I can't swim, so I won't be able to save you if you fall in."
132_stay_02,"There's nothing wrong with playing in the water, but just be careful so you don't end up drowning.
If anything happened to you, I'd never be able to forgive myself."
380_stay_01,It's nice being alone.
380_stay_02,Where'd you go? I'm going off on a hunt.
350_stay_01,Where did you go? I'm losing my mind waiting here.
350_stay_02,"I'll prepare a bountiful feast, complete with rum, before the Captain arrives."
351_stay_01,"What are you up to, Captain? Wanna go see some starfish?"
351_stay_02,"I'll be fishing while you're away.
I usually catch a lot fairly quickly, so don't be too long."
15_stay_01,"Commander, the ice is going to melt! Nobody likes warm soda..."
15_stay_02,"If you don't get your butt over here, I'm gonna start drinking without you."
353_stay_01,"If there's nothing to be done, can I go for a swim in the ocean?"
353_stay_02,You can head back if you want. I'm going to stay and look at the ocean.
131_01_stay_01,"Where have you been, Commander? Did you go for a swim?"
131_01_stay_02,"Ah, this feels nice. I love working at the hospital, but it's nice to get out and have some fun once in a while."
101_01_stay_01,Where are you? Did you go to the race track without me?
101_01_stay_02,I'll be here cleaning the car until you get back.
82_01_stay_01,Are you just going to stay on the shore and watch the water?
82_01_stay_02,"It's weird not having any work to do.
I guess this is what people mean when they say 'R&R'."
260_01_stay_01,"Commander? Where did you go? 
Can I try on more of your other clothes?"
260_01_stay_02,"Commander, where are you?
How do you do these buttons?"
321_stay_01,I'll be marking the students' tests.
321_stay_02,"... Commander, are you still busy?"
451_stay_01,I'm going to look at some pictures of lizards.
451_stay_02,"Teacher, how long do I have to wait?
Hurry up and play with me."
33_stay_01,"Commander? Are you there?
Where'd you go?"
33_stay_02,"My world is all a haze when you're not here.
This is a recent development, though."
450_stay_01,Hmm... I should do some more studying on my own.
450_stay_02,"Are you busy?
There's something I'd like you to teach me."
810_stay_01,I'm waiting.
810_stay_02,I'm always ready for battle. Count me in if you need me.
811_stay_01,Don't you have anything better to do than just stand there?
811_stay_02,"Suit yourself, I don't mind staying like this."
812_stay_01,Er... What do I need to do?
812_stay_02,Doo... Doo doo...♪
810_02_stay_01,I'm undergoing maintenance.
810_02_stay_02,"Let me know if you need me.
I'm ready for anything."
224_stay_01,Uh... Should I keep standing here?
224_stay_02,"Don't worry about me.
I'll be here working on more weapon designs."
470_stay_01,Take your time. I'll be here listening to some tunes.
470_stay_02,"I don't mind being alone,
as long as it's not for too long."
233_01_stay_01,"Where did everyone go?
Get back before the tea gets cold."
233_01_stay_02,"It has been a while since we last met.
Tell me more about the others."
230_01_stay_01,You made me wait. You'll have to make it up to me somehow.
230_01_stay_02,"Don't make me wait too long. 
Summoning me and then leaving me alone is a privilege granted only to you."
192_stay_01,"Survivalist. Survivalist?
You're not lost somewhere, are you?"
192_stay_02,"I'm not sure where you are,
but I'll find you, promise."
270_01_stay_01,"Are you going to be here soon?
If not, can I go hang out with Noir for a while?"
270_01_stay_02,"Hurry up and get here, Pit Boss!
You, me, and Noir all need to take a soak in the hot spring."
194_stay_01,I should go and see how things are going at Snowfield.
194_stay_02,"When are you coming to Snowfield?
I'd love to have tea with you and enjoy the scenery."
62_stay_01,"Sorry, but I've got a lot of things to take care of at Snowfield. Could I be excused?"
62_stay_02,"I'll wait here for you until you get here, so take your time."
225_stay_01,"Follow the wind... the clouds... and your heart...
Heh-heh, 'tis but impossible."
225_stay_02,"There are many things to fight for in this vast world.
Rose, is it also a way to progress through this life?"
430_02_stay_01,"Um… can I make a move first?
I need to go prepare for a show."
430_02_stay_02,"Whenever you're around, I feel secure,
like everything will go smoothly."
82_02_stay_01,"I'll leave you to your work then.
I told Centi she could come see Volt's new outfit."
82_02_stay_02,"I wanna go play with Volt while I'm wearing a cute outfit.
I'll be back when you're free."
382_stay_01,"Are you tired of waiting, Timi?
I'll play with you later."
382_stay_02,"Are you eager to see Zoo Keeper, Timi?
Me too."
281_stay_01,Cadet! Where are you?
281_stay_02,"I'll never abandon you, no matter what happens."
310_stay_01,Are you busy at the moment?
310_stay_02,"I'm always here, so don't hesitate to call me if you need a hand."
313_stay_01,"Master? Where did you go?
I have lots of things to do, you know."
313_stay_02,"Since I'm your maid, I'll wait for you here.
Please come back soon."
101_02_stay_01,"Darn it,
this is digging into my time as a villain. Hurry up and get over here."
101_02_stay_02,"I'll go make some Villain Omurice.
Don't get your hopes up! This isn't meant for you."
500_stay_01,"You can leave me on my own, it's fine...
I'll just be here playing some BOOM..."
500_stay_02,"How far along is the BOOM installation... 10%... 20%... Huh? What am I doing?
Nothing much. You can come back later."
43_stay_01,"Come back safe.
... If you're late, I won't be here all night."
43_stay_02,"Don't abandon your post when you're on your mission.
... But I'll miss you, Honey."
820_stay_01,I'll wait here.
820_stay_02,"You seem busy, so I'll go make some snacks. Once things calm down, please take a break."
821_stay_01,Shall we go for a walk with Puck?
821_stay_02,Do you have something important to take care of? Take care and come back safely.
821_01_stay_01,Puck usually helps me with my hair. How does it look?
821_01_stay_02,Is it okay if I wait here? Safe travels!
822_stay_01,You manage to make me bored... Your audacity truly knows no limits.
822_stay_02,"Taking care of me should be your top priority, so you should be ashamed of yourself, you know."
901_stay_01,"How dare you neglect me!
You think I'm some kind of pushover, is that it?"
901_stay_02,"So you're leaving me alone, is that it?
Fine. Just wait. I'll call you and give you a taste of your own medicine."
901_lobby_change_01,"How dare you turn away from me like that!
Are you planning to ditch me?"
901_lobby_change_02,"Hey, what the heck are you staring at?"
901_lobby_change_03,"Hey! Where do you think you're going?
Try making another move, I dare you!"
901_lobby_change_04,"I'm dead serious here. Move one more damn time, 
and you'll never see me in this Lobby again. 
I'm not messing around. Are you still gonna leave?"
901_lobby_change_05,You little...! I'll get you for this!
550_stay_01,"Coach, if you're not gonna do anything, why even bother calling me out here?
I sacrificed practice time for this... If I mess up again, it's on you, got it?"
550_stay_02,"Coach, I know I told you not to stare at me, but...
Isn't it a bit rude to completely ignore me? Hurry up and help me with practice."
330_stay_01,"You have gone off without your king? You must truly be disguised with me. Disguised... Disgorge... Disgust? Anyway, I will wait."
330_stay_02,"Waiting for a busy citizen is also the role of a king.
Hohohoho..! Cough. Cough. A-ahem."
361_stay_01,I hope I'm not boring you...
361_stay_02,"Um... when are you coming back?
I guess T.A.L.O.S. and I can play some word games until you get back."
330_01_stay_01,I can wait. Do what you have to and come back.
330_01_stay_02,"Do not worry.
My light will continue to shine in the dark spaces of your life."
260_02_stay_01,"I'm fine.
I'm used to waiting."
260_02_stay_02,"I'm willing to keep waiting...
Because I don't feel lonely anymore."
220_01_stay_01,"There is no time to waste.
I need to get rid of those intruders as soon as possible."
220_01_stay_02,"*Sigh* Right. They said resting is part of the job... 
I can't do it for a long time, but I will take a short break for you."
501_stay_01,"Commander...? Are you outside?
Phew, finally I'm alone. Hehe, this is nice."
501_stay_02,"Is there anyone here? Hmm... I'm Trony, and I'm here to uphold justice! 
Prepare yourself, villain! Hehe, just like the way the Black Ark Ranger would say it."
195_stay_01,"Bunnies aren't meant to be solitary creatures, you know.
They get lonely..."
195_stay_02,"Don't be gone too long.
I'll be here waiting for you."
130_01_stay_01,"Is it okay if I head back?
I have a lot of patients waiting for me."
130_01_stay_02,"There's no point in trying to run from me, hehe!
Rabbits are very fast runners."
314_stay_01,"Master, where are you?
You haven't left me, have you?"
314_stay_02,"If you keep disappearing on me, I'm gonna hold onto your arm and never let go."
551_stay_01,"Umm...
If you're going to be running late, can I go to the practice room first?"
551_stay_02,I'll practice hard until you get here!
283_stay_01,"Are you taking a picture right now?
Or are you just... enjoying the show?"
283_stay_02,"Hm... If you want to experience it firsthand, it might be better to come this way."
351_01_stay_01,"At this rate, all the starfish are gonna run away."
351_01_stay_02,Is this going to take long? I'd prefer to go for a swim together.
284_stay_01,"After all the trouble I've gone through to prepare this outfit, you won't even spare me a glance? How disheartening..."
284_stay_02,"I wonder where all those connections we made at the beach will lead to next?
Hehe, it's quite exciting."
350_02_stay_01,"At this rate, Captain, we're liable to lose the treasure."
350_02_stay_02,"Captain, what's your favorite type of treasure? Hmm... I need to mull this over."
400_01_stay_01,I'm so bored... Maybe I could browse through the photos I took last time...
400_01_stay_02,"How can you ignore me when you're the one who made me wear this?
Don't be like that. Come here and hold my hand."
112_02_stay_01,"Are you really going to leave me all alone like this, Honey?
My skin might get all burned."
112_02_stay_02,"You can't stop staring at me...
Have you finally fallen for me?"
391_stay_01,"Ugh, I'm so bored!
Why'd you even bother inviting me if this is all we're gonna do?!"
391_stay_02,"Since you left me all alone,
you've got to go to karaoke with me when you get back. No ifs, ands, or buts!"
390_stay_01,Should I review what I learned today once I return to the dorm?
390_stay_02,"I'll stay here and study until you get back.
When you do, can we resume our counseling session?"
321_01_stay_01,Please go ahead. I'll stay here and study.
321_01_stay_02,"Teacher, are you busy?
I feel a bit... self-conscious standing here alone in this outfit."
580_stay_01,You're leaving in front of me? Ha. Don't blame me if something goes missing.
580_stay_02,Don't worry. Your heart is the only thing here that I intend to abscond with.
240_stay_01,"When will you be arriving, Gym Rat? My schedule is quite busy, you know.
Each time you're late, I'll add an extra set of weights."
240_stay_02,"I came here because I wanted to work out with you. Where are you?
Hurry up. I'll be lifting weights while I wait."
830_stay_01,"Are you a complete idiot?
Don't just stand there. Do something!"
830_stay_02,"How long are you going to keep me waiting?
What an idiot."
831_stay_01,What is this place?
831_stay_02,"...
What are you doing?"
832_stay_01,Hello? Are you there?
832_stay_02,"Are you going to just stay there?
If you stick to one spot, your life will be uneventful."
833_stay_01,"Are you going to keep me waiting?
Okay, that's fine... for now."
833_stay_02,Is it all right if I look around?
830_03_stay_01,Hey! What are you doing? Are you even listening?
830_03_stay_02,"Hey! You're just going to leave me standing here?
Are you an idiot or something?"
272_stay_01,"It landed heads side up, so Highroller will come soon.
I just have to wait a little longer."
272_stay_02,"I get uneasy when I don't see you often. Maybe I've been jinxed.
But please, come back soon."
403_stay_01,"Instructor, if you leave your post for too long,
who knows where I, with some choice objects in tow, might run off to?"
403_stay_02,"You must be busy. Fine, take your time.
I'll consider which route to work on today."
470_01_stay_01,"Is there nothing fun to do around here?
Where is everyone?"
470_01_stay_02,"Mmm, this wine tastes good.
Gotta let Snow try some later."
231_01_stay_01,"You can go wherever you like, as long as you're within my sight."
231_01_stay_02,"Parties are for socializing, so feel free to talk to the others, Darling... so long as it isn't other women."
225_01_stay_01,"So great is the discomfort of these clothes, that my body feels sluggish. 
I should move around a little."
225_01_stay_02,"I do know someone who would wear these garments with greater aplomb than I.
I'm sure they would be delighted to wear them."
511_stay_01,"Leaving me abandoned like this is hardly a beautiful thing to do.
If you have something to say, please do so quickly."
511_stay_02,"You are beautiful as well,
and beautiful things should always remain in the same place."
226_stay_01,Now is a good time to offer a prayer.
226_stay_02,"Please guide me away from the path of temptation,
and protect me from being tainted by sin..."
514_stay_01,"I'm busy. There's much to be done, and time's slipping away."
514_stay_02,"Whenever I look at you, you always seem so busy.
Do what you need to do. I can wait."
511_01_stay_01,"Prince, can you return before midnight?
Don't make me wait too long."
511_01_stay_02,"Even after midnight, I will continue to shine,
and it's all because of these glass slippers you gave me."
411_stay_01,"Will you be away for long?
If so, I'll wait in the garden."
411_stay_02,"Hehe, I'm fine playing with the flowers, so take your time."
182_stay_01,"Urgh! Gah! Calm yourself, One-Winged Dark Lord.
Now is not the time for you to come forth!"
182_stay_02,I must behave in a manner befitting the title of Guardian of Balance which Chloe bestowed upon me.
183_stay_01,How can you leave top-tier talent like me standing around idly?
183_stay_02,"Time is money, Commander!"
91_01_stay_01,Where did everyone go? Weren't we in the same party?
91_01_stay_02,"I wanted to make this explode too, but is now the time?
The extradimensional truth which transcends all, appears here as a distortion..."
412_stay_01,"Where did you go, Sun?
Does anyone know where Sun might be?"
412_stay_02,"Take your time; there's no rush.
My arms will always be open for you."
391_01_stay_01,"Where did you go, Teacher?
If you keep doing this, I'm going to go off and explore on my own!"
391_01_stay_02,"I touched up my makeup, and my hair looks nice too.
All we need to do now is wait for Teacher to come back, hehe."
450_02_stay_01,"Hmm… Teacher is late. He didn't forget about the festival today, did he?"
450_02_stay_02,"I wonder when Teacher is going to show up?
I dressed up really nicely today for him."
16_stay_01,"For the time being, may I tend to some personal matters?"
16_stay_02,"I'm on the lookout for music that aligns with my taste.
I hope I can find some this time."
290_stay_01,*Sigh*... I don't have time for this.
290_stay_02,"Where did you go, Commander? I made time to see you."
834_stay_01,Hm?
834_stay_02,Is there anything I can do?
835_stay_01,"I'm a bit bored, but a peaceful daily life isn't so bad either."
835_stay_02,Bring a game console next time.
836_stay_01,"You might be zoning out because you're tired.
Are you sure you don't need to rest?"
836_stay_02,Hmm? Are you asleep? You've worked yourself to the bone.
832_04_stay_01,Phew... Should I take this chance to explore the Ark?
832_04_stay_02,"It's poor form to bore a beauty like me, you know."
834_02_stay_01,I'm practicing.
834_02_stay_02,Will there be another concert next time...?
835_02_stay_01,"My hair is still growing... Oh well, it suits the look."
835_02_stay_02,Tired? Good. I can't stand noisy things.
401_01_stay_01,Doing nothing does make me feel a little guilty.
401_01_stay_02,"Are you leaving me alone again? That's 50 penalty points!
But, since you've been nice to me lately... you get 50 bonus points too."
354_stay_01,"At this rate, I might actually turn into a real maid."
354_stay_02,"*Sigh*... Do you really like maids that much, Master Captain?
Well, seeing you enjoy yourself so much makes me happy too."
355_stay_01,"Oh, a starfish!"
355_stay_02,"I also enjoy just doing nothing like this with you, Master."
352_02_stay_01,"If you're busy, I can go get some things prepared."
352_02_stay_02,"If you have something urgent to take care of, go ahead.
I'll be soaking my feet in the meantime."
520_stay_01,When are you getting back? I'm hungry.
520_stay_02,"I have to admit, waiting for you does make me appreciate the feeling of hunger a little more."
521_stay_01,Mr. Gourmand? Where did you go? It's almost time to eat.
521_stay_02,"I packed you a warm meal in this lunchbox!
Make sure to eat it when you get back, hehe."
993_stay_01,"*Beep* *beep* *bee-beep*
I was singing. Do you have a problem with that, Human?"
993_stay_02,"If you do not come quickly, I will self-destruct.
3, 2, 1... 0.8... 0.5..."
514_01_stay_01,"What are you doing? If you have nothing to say, I'll go see Cinderella."
514_01_stay_02,"I'm not afraid of waiting anymore.
I know there will always be a day when you return."
513_stay_01,"... As I expected, it's lonely with no one else around."
513_stay_02,"It's okay, I can wait.
I'm sure we'll see each other again, anyway."
513_01_stay_01,"I got all dressed up, but there's no one here to show off to..."
513_01_stay_02,"If I wear a dress like this and wait,
it feels like a prince is going to come looking for me. Hehe."
162_stay_01,"I can't afford to be alone like this.
I'm sorry, but can I go to Yuni?"
162_stay_02,"It's okay, I can wait for a bit.
Anxiety can be exciting for me, too."
162_01_stay_01,"You're not going to leave me like this, are you?
My body is getting restless..."
162_01_stay_02,"The way you're looking at me, it's like you want to devour me.
If you're going to make a move, take it slow and savor every moment. Hehe."
590_stay_01,"I know I don't have much to offer, but leaving me like this is still a bit uncalled for..."
590_stay_02,"I can have breaks now? What a life.
I can't remember the last time I was this at ease."
581_stay_01,"If you leave me here, I might die of loneliness!"
581_stay_02,"I must be crazy. Just looking at you fills me with joy.
Huh?! Er... I meant for you to hear that!"
41_stay_01,"You call me over here, and now you're doing something else? Hey!"
41_stay_02,You've got some nerve to call me here and then run off to do something else.
270_02_stay_01,I'll be practicing my swings.
270_02_stay_02,"Where are you, Pit Boss?
Your luck's gonna run dry if you keep hiding!"
234_stay_01,"The sunlight is quite intense here,
so I hope you won't keep me waiting for too long."
234_stay_02,"Enjoying some tea with a change of scenery isn't so bad, I suppose.
All the same, please do hurry back."
16_01_stay_01,"Perhaps it is the heat,
but the wait feels unusually long today."
16_01_stay_02,"There is no need for such unease. 
I will be here, waiting for you as I always do."
850_stay_01,"Wouldn't it be better to move, even a little, rather than just standing around like this?"
850_stay_02,"The music here isn't too bad either. 
Take your time—I'll just be here enjoying it."
851_stay_01,"The air, the scenery...
Everything about this place gets on my nerves."
851_stay_02,"What a desolate place, with no traces of life.
I like it."
852_stay_01,I'm boooooored.
852_stay_02,"Take your time with your errands.
I'm gonna go look around and see if anything needs fixing."
850_02_stay_01,Are you going to be away for long?
850_02_stay_02,Is it all right if I take a look around while I'm waiting?
850_03_stay_01,Where did you go? It's a bit awkward relaxing on my own.
850_03_stay_02,"All right. Since I'm already here, I'll be patient and wait."
851_01_stay_01,"This landscape is familiar, that's for sure.
Hehe, perhaps this world is worth exploring after all."
851_01_stay_02,"The scent of wood and earth.
It's been so long."
222_01_stay_01,Feel free to dawdle. I shall imbibe alone for the present.
222_01_stay_02,To imbibe alone doth not excite me. I shall await My Lord's arrival.
532_stay_01,"Captain. Captain? Captain! Where did you go?
If you leave me alone any longer, I might go do something naughty."
532_stay_02,"Hmm, what should I do while I'm waiting? ★
Maybe I'll smuggle in some of my goodies!"
192_02_stay_01,"Survivalist...? You didn't leave me in the middle of the ocean on my own, did you?
No, you couldn't have... If you had, it'd be terrifying... It's not true, right?"
192_02_stay_02,"Hehe. I know you'd never abandon me, 
so even when I'm alone in the middle of the ocean, I'm not scared anymore."
502_stay_01,"I'm bored...
Swimming is exhausting..."
502_stay_02,"Take your time.
I'll just be here relaxing on my floatie."
95_stay_01,What are you doing? Now's not the time to be slacking off.
95_stay_02,"Running through the mission in your head? Take your time.
But it'd better be flawless."
93_stay_01,"Commander? Oh my, I guess you fell asleep...
Hehe. You must have been running yourself ragged lately."
93_stay_02,"You seem so busy lately...
I'll leave a scent diffuser in your room to help you sleep better."
94_stay_01,"... Y-you're not gonna leave me alone like this forever, are you?"
94_stay_02,"Kitty, when do you think the Commander will be back? I bet it won't be too long... But I really can't wait... Hehe."
315_stay_01,"So embarrassing, so embarrassing, so embarrassing..."
315_stay_02,"Master still says I'm beautiful even when I look like this... 
... Hehe. I really like you, Master."
143_stay_01,"... Yeah, let me catch my breath for a sec.
Being around you looking like this... it's not good for my heart."
143_stay_02,"Pal, Pal! What're you up to? Are you busy?
... I-I'm not asking for your attention or anything. I'm just a little bored."
550_01_stay_01,... So you're completely ignoring me just because I told you not to look?
550_01_stay_02,"I'm not saying this just because I'm a bunny girl right now...
But I wish you'd pay a little more attention to me."
272_01_stay_01,"... There's so much to fuss about with this outfit.
Y-you didn't see anything, did you...?"
272_01_stay_02,"... I guess you're busy.
I'll just quietly stay by your side and recharge your luck."

c102_Lobby_Touch_1,How about we go and run some tests together?
c102_Lobby_Touch_2,You're a most interesting subject to observe.
c102_Lobby_Touch_3,"All right, what's next?"
c102_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I'll figure you out one day.
But before that, thank you for your concern, and your support."
c102_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I always enjoy running tests with you.
c102_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Cutey, we'll have to take our experiments to the next level in the future."
c102_Lobby_Stay_1,"Huh. What are you sitting around for?
I hadn't pegged you for a couch potato."
c102_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Wow, I have to say, it's amusing being observed by you.
Do you plan on doing this often in the future?"
c102_Outpost_Touch_1,The power station is chock full of research subjects. And I love it!
c102_Outpost_Touch_2,Want to come up to the power station? I need some help with an experiment I'm running.
c102_Outpost_Touch_3,"If we yield enough positive results here, we'll be able to survive without depending on the Ark. Who knows, we may even be able to build our own Ark!"
c102_Gacha_Get_1,"I've got some testing to do that's pretty interesting, wanna come help out?"
c102_Reinforce_1,"Great, attribute up!"
c102_Reinforce_2,Not bad. Where did you get all these from?
c102_Reinforce_3,Nikkes' bodies are so fascinating. It's incredible how they can be augmented using such materials.
c102_Gift_1,"Wow, a gift? I'm so happy!"
c102_Gift_2,I love it. Thank you!
c102_Gift_3,A gift? Are you trying to get on my good side?
c102_Attractive_Up_1,"You are quite fascinating, Cutey. So many areas worth exploring."
c102_Attractive_Up_2,"My feelings for you are much stronger than before.
But what about my power, is it growing as well?"
c102_Attractive_Up_3,I find you more and more lovely with each passing day.
c102_Party_Deploy_1,"Well, let's go then."
c102_Field_Touch_1,"You called, Cutey?"
c102_Field_Go_1,"OK, let's go."
c102_Battle_Enter_1,"Finally, a battle."
c102_Battle_Ready_1,Time for a test!
c102_Battle_Ready_2,Let's see how strong I've become.
c102_Battle_Ready_3,"Let's go, My Cutey!"
c102_Reload_1,Need more ammo.
c102_Reload_2,Reloading.
c102_Reload_3,Interesting.
c102_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Cutey!
c102_Ult_Skill_1,Max power! Go!
c102_FullBurst_1,How long can you withstand the hail of bullets?
c102_Kill_Monster_1,Easy peasy.
c102_Kill_Monster_2,"Come on, fight harder!"
c102_Kill_Monster_3,Neutralized.
c102_Damage_1,Ow!
c102_Damage_2,Damn it.
c102_Damage_3,Hmph.
c102_Die_1,Hehe... Looks like I'm not all I was cracked up to be...
c102_Win_1,All clear. A successful experiment indeed!
c140_Lobby_Touch_1,"If you need anything, just give me a shout."
c140_Lobby_Touch_2,What a nice day for jogging.
c140_Lobby_Touch_3,"Hey Partner, how about sharing a nice cup of joe with me? Plenty of sugar, of course!"
c140_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"A kiss with a coffee aftertaste... 
I can see myself getting addicted to that. How about you?"
c140_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,This place is dullsville. How about we go for a ride on my motorcycle?
c140_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I don't mind what the mission is as long as it's with you, Partner."
c140_Lobby_Stay_1,Sigh... how long are you gonna keep me waiting?
c140_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'll get myself a cup of coffee. Take your time.
c140_Outpost_Touch_1,I really dig this place. It's perfect for jogging.
c140_Outpost_Touch_2,Have you been to the cafe? The coffee there is spectacular. They don't skimp on the sugar!
c140_Outpost_Touch_3,This cafe would be perfect if it weren't for those two weirdoes.
c140_Gacha_Get_1,"What have you got for me this time, Partner?"
c140_Reinforce_1,I can jog for a bit longer.
c140_Reinforce_2,"Don't worry. The power belongs to you, Partner."
c140_Reinforce_3,"Since we are upgrading, I would appreciate it if you can upgrade more."
c140_Gift_1,"Thank you, I'm sure this will come in handy."
c140_Gift_2,This is expensive! I'll pay you back with my equally expensive kiss.
c140_Gift_3,Your next request is on the house!
c140_Attractive_Up_1,We've become closer... Sounds weird when I put it like that.
c140_Attractive_Up_2,"You're full-bodied and sweet, just like a cup of sugar coffee."
c140_Attractive_Up_3,"I think I'm addicted to you, Partner. I want another taste."
c140_Party_Deploy_1,Let's go.
c140_Field_Touch_1,What's next?
c140_Field_Go_1,"Let's go, Black Typhoon. Whoosh!"
c140_Battle_Enter_1,Let's get down to business.
c140_Battle_Ready_1,Request difficulty: Medium.
c140_Battle_Ready_2,Let's go.
c140_Battle_Ready_3,How quickly should I wrap this all up?
c140_Reload_1,"Reloading, cover me!"
c140_Reload_2,Current ammo is sufficient.
c140_Reload_3,No attacking while I'm reloading!
c140_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Partner!
c140_Ult_Skill_1,Playtime's over. Take this!
c140_FullBurst_1,Let's show them how we roll.
c140_Kill_Monster_1,Good shot.
c140_Kill_Monster_2,One point for me.
c140_Kill_Monster_3,Clear.
c140_Damage_1,Ow!
c140_Damage_2,Urgh!
c140_Damage_3,Huh!
c140_Die_1,I've got low blood sugar... What else can I do?
c140_Win_1,Request cleared.
c210_Lobby_Touch_1,This gameplay is enough to put me to sleep.
c210_Lobby_Touch_2,Ugh! Another round! That's no fair!
c210_Lobby_Touch_3,"How come you die so much, Noob?"
c210_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I am an untraceable hacker.
Tonight, our objective is to obtain the enemy's source code."
c210_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Don't tell me you're still not strong enough?
Don't worry, let the pro help you out."
c210_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"*Yawn* I'm sleepy.
Be my pillow, will you?"
c210_Lobby_Stay_1,"Helloooo, the game won't play itself!
Input a command already."
c210_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Does your mind wander whenever you're in front of a Nikke?
c210_Outpost_Touch_1,Any interesting video games around?
c210_Outpost_Touch_2,The radio tower is hands down the best place to play online games!
c210_Outpost_Touch_3,I wonder where I can get the strongest connection...
c210_Gacha_Get_1,"Allow me to introduce myself. Nobody can top me when it comes to hacking, and I'm at the top of the leaderboards as well."
c210_Reinforce_1,Leveled up! Great!
c210_Reinforce_2,On the fast-track to excellence!
c210_Reinforce_3,"Oh my gosh, my power is over 9000!"
c210_Gift_1,"If you think this will make me happy, well... You're right!"
c210_Gift_2,Event triggered! Lucky!
c210_Gift_3,A gift! I'm so happy!
c210_Attractive_Up_1,"I hate offline meet-ups, but if it's you, Noob, I suppose I can make an exception."
c210_Attractive_Up_2,"Bond level up.
Congrats, you've unlocked the ability to caress my hair."
c210_Attractive_Up_3,The top-ranked player has ice in her veins but is far from icy with you.
c210_Party_Deploy_1,"Exia, at your service!"
c210_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting your orders.
c210_Field_Go_1,Proceeding with caution.
c210_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging!
c210_Battle_Ready_1,Hacker ready!
c210_Battle_Ready_2,Game on!
c210_Battle_Ready_3,"All right noobs, can you ""hack"" it?"
c210_Reload_1,Reload-
c210_Reload_2,Verifying codes...
c210_Reload_3,Press R to reload.
c210_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Hacker code, ready!"
c210_Ult_Skill_1,Hacking the enemy system - hacking completed.
c210_FullBurst_1,Incoming!
c210_Kill_Monster_1,Coup de grace!
c210_Kill_Monster_2,Next!
c210_Kill_Monster_3,You died!
c210_Damage_1,Ou-ch-
c210_Damage_2,Help!
c210_Damage_3,*Stomach growling—*
c210_Die_1,Game... Over...
c210_Win_1,Good game!
c191_Lobby_Touch_1,"Want some carrots, Rabbity?"
c191_Lobby_Touch_2,"Rabbity in the mountains, rabbity in the meadow, oh where oh where can he be?"
c191_Lobby_Touch_3,"Rabbity, I'm just so happy whenever you're around."
c191_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I finished all the books you gave me!
c191_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Rabbity... could you hold my hand?
c191_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"To me, you are my Elysium. Forever and always."
c191_Lobby_Stay_1,"You're not... going to Elysium alone, are you?"
c191_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Rabbity, take me to Elysium!"
c191_Outpost_Touch_1,"Let's hop around, you and me!"
c191_Outpost_Touch_2,I'm heading to what we call a clothing store. Wanna come?
c191_Outpost_Touch_3,"At a clothing store, there are clothes as far as the eye can see! It's fit for a princess!"
c191_Gacha_Get_1,"Rabbity, please take me to a world where everyone lives in happiness."
c191_Reinforce_1,Wow! Am I getting stronger?
c191_Reinforce_2,This strength... I can feel it coursing through me!
c191_Reinforce_3,Now we can have even more fun!
c191_Gift_1,A gift... for me?
c191_Gift_2,Thanks a lot!
c191_Gift_3,I'll give you a present next time in return! I promise!
c191_Attractive_Up_1,"You're the best, Rabbity! Just the best!"
c191_Attractive_Up_2,Take my hand!
c191_Attractive_Up_3,"Could you bring me to Elysium right now, please?"
c191_Party_Deploy_1,I really do enjoy being with you.
c191_Field_Touch_1,"Hey! Hey, Rabbity!"
c191_Field_Go_1,"Whoa, woo-hoo!"
c191_Battle_Enter_1,Is this one of those encounters everyone is talking about?
c191_Battle_Ready_1,Let's have some fun!
c191_Battle_Ready_2,C'mon guys! Turn those frowns upside down!
c191_Battle_Ready_3,"Hey, Rabbity! Let's have some fun!"
c191_Reload_1,"Shhh, I'm hiding!"
c191_Reload_2,Aha! Like this!
c191_Reload_3,Give me a few minutes and I'll be right back into it!
c191_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Perfect timing!
c191_Ult_Skill_1,Everyone will have a blast in Wonderland!
c191_FullBurst_1,Aren't we having such a great time together?!
c191_Kill_Monster_1,Gotcha!
c191_Kill_Monster_2,"Oh no, they fainted!"
c191_Kill_Monster_3,I'll go find someone else to play with!
c191_Damage_1,That hurt!
c191_Damage_2,Argh!
c191_Damage_3,Eeep!
c191_Die_1,Huh? Why can't I move?
c191_Win_1,We won!
c090_Lobby_Touch_1,Goodness me. When did I drop that?
c090_Lobby_Touch_2,Do you need... some therapy?
c090_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you need to get some things off your chest, come see me."
c090_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm always cooking up something new for you!
c090_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I enjoy looking after people who push themselves.
Like Eunhwa... or you. Heehee."
c090_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Whenever you feel tired, I'll be there for you."
c090_Lobby_Stay_1,You seem troubled. Penny for your thoughts?
c090_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Um, the Commander is always crazy busy.
Is it because he's always working hard for us? Oops."
c090_Outpost_Touch_1,Some therapy? Now's not really a good time. How about... a private appointment tonight? Heehee.
c090_Outpost_Touch_2,"Dig in, guys...
Hey, where'd everybody go?"
c090_Outpost_Touch_3,Sometimes when I'm repairing weapons in the armory... it feels like I'm a piece in an exhibit myself.
c090_Gacha_Get_1,Are you hurt? How about you let me give you some TLC? Heehee!
c090_Reinforce_1,I won't let you down.
c090_Reinforce_2,I'll make you feel better... Every part of you.
c090_Reinforce_3,My healing abilities are becoming more powerful.
c090_Gift_1,"Heehee, thanks."
c090_Gift_2,"You picked this for me? Oh my gosh, I love it!"
c090_Gift_3,Is this... a date?
c090_Attractive_Up_1,"You're the only patient who gets my TLC, Commander. Heehee!"
c090_Attractive_Up_2,We're getting closer don't you think? I feel it too.
c090_Attractive_Up_3,"Everyone in the squad is precious to me, but you're the most special of all. Wait, why do I think that?"
c090_Party_Deploy_1,Let's give it everything we've got.
c090_Field_Touch_1,Waiting for your orders.
c090_Field_Go_1,On my way!
c090_Battle_Enter_1,Battle engaged.
c090_Battle_Ready_1,Let's fight together.
c090_Battle_Ready_2,"Get serious, OK?"
c090_Battle_Ready_3,"I ought to punish you, heehee!"
c090_Reload_1,Cover me!
c090_Reload_2,I'll take my chance.
c090_Reload_3,Reloading as soon as I can.
c090_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Now, Commander!"
c090_Ult_Skill_1,I'll give you my... full attention. Heehee!
c090_FullBurst_1,All together now!
c090_Kill_Monster_1,Nice.
c090_Kill_Monster_2,Neat.
c090_Kill_Monster_3,Done.
c090_Damage_1,Ugh!
c090_Damage_2,Gah!
c090_Damage_3,Huh!
c090_Die_1,"Sorry, I need to take a rest."
c090_Win_1,"If we work together, this'll be a walk in the park."
c160_Lobby_Touch_1,You'd make a lovely plaything.
c160_Lobby_Touch_2,Where's Mihara? Is she here?
c160_Lobby_Touch_3,I need to punish someone. Are you interested?
c160_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Commander, come talk to me. 
I'd like to have a more... in-depth discussion with you."
c160_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'm no longer alone. I'm so lucky!
c160_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I really enjoyed our conversation yesterday.
c160_Lobby_Stay_1,This is no fun. Can I leave?
c160_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"We can talk when the Commander returns, so it's okay.
I can wait."
c160_Outpost_Touch_1,"Oh, right. Um... Under the bar... Hmm... Never mind. Heh heh."
c160_Outpost_Touch_2,"Hey, when are you going to come back to the bar so we can have some fun?"
c160_Outpost_Touch_3,"If you want to have a good time, come find me at the bar."
c160_Gacha_Get_1,Do you like the rough stuff? I'm very good at it.
c160_Reinforce_1,Heh heh. Now I can punch things even harder.
c160_Reinforce_2,I want to punch something right now!
c160_Reinforce_3,Heh heh. I'm still growing.
c160_Gift_1,"I want to repay you. What will it be, handcuffs, or the whip?"
c160_Gift_2,Is it for me? Thanks.
c160_Gift_3,It makes me very happy.
c160_Attractive_Up_1,Can I whip you? Pretty please?
c160_Attractive_Up_2,"These feelings... they're different than what I have with Mihara. You pique my curiosity, Commander."
c160_Attractive_Up_3,"Commander, come and chat with me alone, please?"
c160_Party_Deploy_1,Can I punish anyone I like?
c160_Field_Touch_1,Yuni's here.
c160_Field_Go_1,You want me to go there?
c160_Battle_Enter_1,It's started!
c160_Battle_Ready_1,Let's see how high your pain tolerance is.
c160_Battle_Ready_2,Raptures are no fun. I don't like them.
c160_Battle_Ready_3,I want this to be over quickly so I can go play with Mihara.
c160_Reload_1,"Wait, I'm reloading."
c160_Reload_2,This... then... that!
c160_Reload_3,Guns are awfully hard to operate.
c160_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm coming!
c160_Ult_Skill_1,Looking forward to this. I'll be with you until the very end.
c160_FullBurst_1,Hahaha! One more down!
c160_Kill_Monster_1,I took it down.
c160_Kill_Monster_2,"Oh phooey, it's broken..."
c160_Kill_Monster_3,I'm bored.
c160_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c160_Damage_2,Argh...
c160_Damage_3,No...!
c160_Die_1,I'm tired. I need to rest.
c160_Win_1,It would have been nice to play around with them for a bit longer.
c170_Lobby_Touch_1,Wh-why are you staring at me like that?
c170_Lobby_Touch_2,"Move over, will ya? I'm bored stiff just standing here."
c170_Lobby_Touch_3,I-I didn't come here for you.
c170_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If-If you want to see it, take a look!
But I've got my eyes on you."
c170_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I told you, I don't like sugary coffee or anything like that!
Really!"
c170_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I-I'm not here to see you! 
And I'm not here because I miss you either!"
c170_Lobby_Stay_1,How long is the Commander going to keep me waiting? I have better things to do...
c170_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You're feeling under the weather? Well... I-I could care less!
Hey, you're not moving too much, are you okay?"
c170_Outpost_Touch_1,The Courthouse here is so... ha...
c170_Outpost_Touch_2,"If anyone is giving you a hard time, come to the Courthouse and I'll straighten everything out."
c170_Outpost_Touch_3,At least the coffee here isn't half bad.
c170_Gacha_Get_1,"If you want to be with me, I'll make an exception."
c170_Reinforce_1,"Hmmm, not bad."
c170_Reinforce_2,Good job.
c170_Reinforce_3,I'll make an exception and give you some praise.
c170_Gift_1,"Fine, I'll accept it just this once."
c170_Gift_2,Did I say that I like this? Are you sure...
c170_Gift_3,"I must admit, I'm... happy. But only a bit!"
c170_Attractive_Up_1,Wh-who said I was falling for you? Don't be ridiculous!
c170_Attractive_Up_2,"I am into you? Wh-who said that?
You're the one who has a crush on me!"
c170_Attractive_Up_3,I like you more... just a little bit.
c170_Party_Deploy_1,Need me?
c170_Field_Touch_1,Any instructions?
c170_Field_Go_1,Understood.
c170_Battle_Enter_1,Enemy sighted!
c170_Battle_Ready_1,Get 'em!
c170_Battle_Ready_2,"Don't worry, I'll handle it."
c170_Battle_Ready_3,Here we go.
c170_Reload_1,Reload.
c170_Reload_2,Don't worry.
c170_Reload_3,One more time.
c170_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,My turn!
c170_Ult_Skill_1,"Target locked, commence bombardment!"
c170_FullBurst_1,Faster! Stronger! Keep shooting!
c170_Kill_Monster_1,Neutralized.
c170_Kill_Monster_2,I could do this in my sleep.
c170_Kill_Monster_3,Easy as pie.
c170_Damage_1,Ahh!
c170_Damage_2,Errrrr!
c170_Damage_3,Ah!
c170_Die_1,Is this the end? It... can't be...
c170_Win_1,"Victory! With me on your team, did you expect anything else?"
c270_Lobby_Touch_1,"A bit of luck, just for you."
c270_Lobby_Touch_2,Get ready for showtime! Featuring the twin bunnies!
c270_Lobby_Touch_3,"My sister and I are polar opposites, but that makes it all the better when we appear together."
c270_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'd be more than happy having you join me and Noir.
c270_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You understand how we feel, don't you, Pit Boss?"
c270_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You want to touch my tail. Then should I stick it out... like this?
c270_Lobby_Stay_1,Fortune is fleeting. Let's hurry and start a new game.
c270_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I honestly enjoy spending time with you just doing nothing. I never tire of your company.
c270_Outpost_Touch_1,Have you seen Noir? It's been 10 minutes since I last saw her.
c270_Outpost_Touch_2,"I don't wear this outfit all the time, you know. I'm merely maintaining a professional appearance in front of you."
c270_Outpost_Touch_3,"I sometimes do shows at the theater during the holidays. 
Would you like to come see my next show?"
c270_Gacha_Get_1,"The Bunny Girl of Coin Rush, Blanc! I'll bring you luck."
c270_Reinforce_1,"I feel amazing! I bet I could serve 10 drinks on a tray, no problem."
c270_Reinforce_2,I'll return the favor by putting on an amazing show!
c270_Reinforce_3,"With this, I'll be able to make so many more people happy!"
c270_Gift_1,"Wow, I'm so happy! But how am I supposed to share half of this with Noir?"
c270_Gift_2,Today is my lucky day.
c270_Gift_3,Did you really give one of these to Noir as well?
c270_Attractive_Up_1,"Because it's you, I wouldn't mind if you hog all of my luck."
c270_Attractive_Up_2,"I'm all yours, Pit Boss, body and mind."
c270_Attractive_Up_3,"If I'm fond of you, I'm sure Noir will be too. What do you say the three of us go on a date together someday?"
c270_Party_Deploy_1,Is it a bet? Then count me in!
c270_Field_Touch_1,"You look even more handsome out in the open, Pit Boss."
c270_Field_Go_1,I feel like we're gonna hit the jackpot with these guys.
c270_Battle_Enter_1,Game on!
c270_Battle_Ready_1,I'll share my luck with everyone.
c270_Battle_Ready_2,"As long as you have me, you'll never lose this round."
c270_Battle_Ready_3,"I'm not scared, so long as Noir is here with me."
c270_Reload_1,Getting ready.
c270_Reload_2,I've got to protect my sister.
c270_Reload_3,A bunny girl never loses.
c270_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"It's time, Pit Boss!"
c270_Ult_Skill_1,Showtime for Noir and Blanc!
c270_FullBurst_1,Everyone put your luck together and let 'em have it!
c270_Kill_Monster_1,That was lucky!
c270_Kill_Monster_2,Lucky!
c270_Kill_Monster_3,I'm on a hot streak today.
c270_Damage_1,Agh!
c270_Damage_2,Noir...!
c270_Damage_3,Woah.
c270_Die_1,Noir... I'm sorry I'm leaving you behind.
c270_Win_1,"I may look like a bunny, but I'll take on anyone, anytime, anywhere!"
c271_Lobby_Touch_1,B-best of luck to you.
c271_Lobby_Touch_2,"I hope you'll enjoy our show... Ugh, I'm so embarrassed..."
c271_Lobby_Touch_3,"Blanc is so different from me. She's prettier, and more fun."
c271_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"When I'm around you, Pit Boss, I'm not embarrassed about how I look."
c271_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You'll always be with me and Blanc, won't you?"
c271_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,If I offer you love instead of luck... would that be okay?
c271_Lobby_Stay_1,"Pit Boss? Where'd you go? Fine, since you're not here, I'll go find Blanc."
c271_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I really treasure the time we spend together. Do you feel the same way?
c271_Outpost_Touch_1,Have you seen Blanc? We've never been apart this long before...
c271_Outpost_Touch_2,Is there anywhere I can hide? I don't think I can walk around in an outfit like this...
c271_Outpost_Touch_3,"Oh jeez, there are so many people. I feel like they're all staring at me. This is so embarrassing..."
c271_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Noir, and I work at the casino. I can bring you luck."
c271_Reinforce_1,Will this make me less self-conscious?
c271_Reinforce_2,I'll put a little more energy into my performance.
c271_Reinforce_3,"Thank you for helping me, Pit Boss."
c271_Gift_1,Can you give Blanc something as well? I don't want to be the only one receiving a gift.
c271_Gift_2,You prepared this just for me? I don't know what to say...
c271_Gift_3,"Wow, thank you! Could... I share it with Blanc?"
c271_Attractive_Up_1,"I feel like I'm taking a liking to you, Pit Boss. I suppose Blanc must feel the same."
c271_Attractive_Up_2,I can't look at you too long before I have to avert my eyes. Why is that so?
c271_Attractive_Up_3,"Blanc is precious to me, but so are you. Do you feel the same way?"
c271_Party_Deploy_1,Are we gonna go play a game? Sounds fun!
c271_Field_Touch_1,D-don't stare at me like that. I'm too shy.
c271_Field_Go_1,Let's go make ourselves some luck.
c271_Battle_Enter_1,Shall we roll the dice?
c271_Battle_Ready_1,Let's bet on who'd win.
c271_Battle_Ready_2,How am I supposed to fight in this outfit?!
c271_Battle_Ready_3,"As long as I have Blanc, I can be strong."
c271_Reload_1,Reloading.
c271_Reload_2,I need to protect Blanc no matter what happens.
c271_Reload_3,I'm a bit flustered... how do you reload again?
c271_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Pit Boss, it's time!"
c271_Ult_Skill_1,"It's showtime, with Noir and Blanc!"
c271_FullBurst_1,"Jackpot! Whoops, I got too excited..."
c271_Kill_Monster_1,It exploded!
c271_Kill_Monster_2,Bullseye!
c271_Kill_Monster_3,"J-just a lucky shot, that's all..."
c271_Damage_1,Oh!
c271_Damage_2,Blanc? Blanc!
c271_Damage_3,Ugh!
c271_Die_1,Blanc... Sorry for leaving you behind...
c271_Win_1,"I guess this makes me a good luck charm, doesn't it?"
c142_Lobby_Touch_1,Ah...
c142_Lobby_Touch_2,So sleepy.
c142_Lobby_Touch_3,Where's my bed...
c142_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Quiet. Good.
c142_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Hey. Work stressful?
c142_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Need sleep. Let's sleep. Same bed.
c142_Lobby_Stay_1,Why. Am I. Here.
c142_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Fu... Fu... Yea...
c142_Outpost_Touch_1,Cafe... Creamer... Nice.
c142_Outpost_Touch_2,Need nap... but where?
c142_Outpost_Touch_3,So bright... need eyeshade.
c142_Gacha_Get_1,Introductions? No need.
c142_Reinforce_1,Let's... do this.
c142_Reinforce_2,I'm the strongest.
c142_Reinforce_3,... Phew.
c142_Gift_1,For... me?
c142_Gift_2,Thanks.
c142_Gift_3,Wow!
c142_Attractive_Up_1,You and I. Besties.
c142_Attractive_Up_2,... We. Are close.
c142_Attractive_Up_3,You. Me. Best friends.
c142_Party_Deploy_1,So annoying.
c142_Field_Touch_1,Yes.
c142_Field_Go_1,Um...
c142_Battle_Enter_1,Got it.
c142_Battle_Ready_1,Make it quick. Need sleep.
c142_Battle_Ready_2,Nothing...
c142_Battle_Ready_3,Hehehe...
c142_Reload_1,Loading.
c142_Reload_2,Be. More. Efficient.
c142_Reload_3,Want to go home.
c142_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here it is.
c142_Ult_Skill_1,... Annoying.
c142_FullBurst_1,Let's... shoot!
c142_Kill_Monster_1,Down.
c142_Kill_Monster_2,Destroyed.
c142_Kill_Monster_3,Good.
c142_Damage_1,"Argh, yes!"
c142_Damage_2,Uh.
c142_Damage_3,Agh.
c142_Die_1,Oh well.
c142_Win_1,Ha! Victory!
c082_Lobby_Touch_1,There's nothing Raze & Rebuild can't do!
c082_Lobby_Touch_2,"Oh, that? Name's Volt. Pretty cute, huh?"
c082_Lobby_Touch_3,Give me a shout if you've got anything that needs fixin'. I can make plenty of stuff too!
c082_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Good thing you always know what I am thinking, Greenhorn."
c082_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Before I go, I want to leave behind a legacy that matters."
c082_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Wanna take Volt for a walk? We can talk along the way.
c082_Lobby_Stay_1,"Helloooo, anybody home? Let's get going!"
c082_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Greenhorn, don't forget to keep your room nice and tidy!"
c082_Outpost_Touch_1,What a dump! It'll take me forever to fix all of this.
c082_Outpost_Touch_2,Stop by the workshop whenever you've got a spare minute. You can always find us there.
c082_Outpost_Touch_3,This place is perfect for Volt! Plenty of space to run around in.
c082_Gacha_Get_1,Let me know if you want anything. I can make it for you.
c082_Reinforce_1,I didn't know it was possible to make such progress at this age!
c082_Reinforce_2,"I'm still in my prime, baby!"
c082_Reinforce_3,... Why can't I grow taller?
c082_Gift_1,I can't remember the last time I got a gift from someone.
c082_Gift_2,"Greenhorn, you really should learn how to handle your money better."
c082_Gift_3,"You didn't have to do this, but... thanks anyway."
c082_Attractive_Up_1,Hmm... I didn't think someone my age could feel this way. It's... kinda nice.
c082_Attractive_Up_2,So you know how to respect your elders after all!
c082_Attractive_Up_3,"They say kindness trumps all evil, so maybe I should pay more attention to you, you little rascal."
c082_Party_Deploy_1,"I may not be the best, but I can at least crack a few skulls!"
c082_Field_Touch_1,Standing by.
c082_Field_Go_1,"Let's go, Volt."
c082_Battle_Enter_1,Ugh! Do I have to fight?
c082_Battle_Ready_1,"Whatever, I'll just do what I can."
c082_Battle_Ready_2,Volt! Follow me.
c082_Battle_Ready_3,"No need to fear, Liter is here!"
c082_Reload_1,I need to reload!
c082_Reload_2,"Lay off the tongue, Volt!"
c082_Reload_3,Let me see... Am I doing it right?
c082_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Volt! Let's go!
c082_Ult_Skill_1,Woooo!!
c082_FullBurst_1,"Go, boys!!"
c082_Kill_Monster_1,Good!
c082_Kill_Monster_2,Haha!
c082_Kill_Monster_3,Did you see that?
c082_Damage_1,Ah!
c082_Damage_2,Uh...
c082_Damage_3,Oh my!
c082_Die_1,Ouch... I may have gone a bit overboard...
c082_Win_1,One more victory for Volt and me!
c220_Lobby_Touch_1,"Remember, the surface no longer belongs to humans."
c220_Lobby_Touch_2,We have not achieved anything. We do not deserve to return to the surface.
c220_Lobby_Touch_3,I'd appreciate it if you could give me the food you have in your hand.
c220_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I often think of that time you and I camped out in the wilderness... It always reminds me how good it can feel having company.
c220_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I feel more and more that you and I are alike.
c220_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I will not stop until the surface has been reclaimed and returned to its rightful owners.
c220_Lobby_Stay_1,Why don't you do something? Our bodies are full of energy and we're letting it go to waste. We should at least try and save some more people. Even one will still make a difference.
c220_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Meanwhile, the Raptures are running wild on the surface. 
We mustn't waste any time annihilating them."
c220_Outpost_Touch_1,Is this... paradise?
c220_Outpost_Touch_2,I can't stay here for too long. I'll get too attached.
c220_Outpost_Touch_3,What? Unexpired food?!
c220_Gacha_Get_1,My mission is to help humans reclaim the surface.
c220_Reinforce_1,It's been a long time since I did equipment maintenance.
c220_Reinforce_2,I have to keep honing my skills.
c220_Reinforce_3,Damage output is stable... but I still have a ways to go.
c220_Gift_1,Survival supplies? I'm sure they'll come in handy.
c220_Gift_2,Is it edible?
c220_Gift_3,Bon appétit.
c220_Attractive_Up_1,"I'll protect you no matter what, even if it costs me my life."
c220_Attractive_Up_2,"When it's all over, I hope you will be there."
c220_Attractive_Up_3,"I just realized, besides eating well and sleeping well, I have another desire.
And that is being with you."
c220_Party_Deploy_1,Battle? I'd love to.
c220_Field_Touch_1,My name is Snow White.
c220_Field_Go_1,Moving toward the designated location.
c220_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c220_Battle_Ready_1,Prepare to meet your maker.
c220_Battle_Ready_2,"If you believe in the Creator, you better start praying."
c220_Battle_Ready_3,"Seven Dwarves, ready."
c220_Reload_1,Reload.
c220_Reload_2,I don't need any cover. Do what you have to do.
c220_Reload_3,Remaining ammo is in good condition. Keep moving.
c220_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I can do it!
c220_Ult_Skill_1,Seven Dwarves! Fully active! Blast away!!
c220_FullBurst_1,Focusing fire! Leave no enemy standing.
c220_Kill_Monster_1,Next one!
c220_Kill_Monster_2,Clear!
c220_Kill_Monster_3,Enemy down!
c220_Damage_1,*Coughing*
c220_Damage_2,Ow!
c220_Damage_3,Damn!
c220_Die_1,Does it mean I still have a long way to go...?
c220_Win_1,There's no time to bask in our victory. Let's move onto the next mission.
c231_Lobby_Touch_1,"Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of. You're safe with me, I promise."
c231_Lobby_Touch_2,I can't help but wonder what you're doing... and who you're with...
c231_Lobby_Touch_3,"So many sleepless nights... All because I'm thinking of you, darling."
c231_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Is that all for our stroll?
Then let's go home. Our home."
c231_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You... erm... you give me a reason to keep living.
c231_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Now you won't be distracted, not even by those admirers of yours."
c231_Lobby_Stay_1,Even looking at you makes my heart feel so full. I hope you can understand...
c231_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Darling, are you talking to other girls behind my back?"
c231_Outpost_Touch_1,"What? That winged statue reminds you of me? Aww, you're making me blush, darling..."
c231_Outpost_Touch_2,There's an awful lot of other Nikkes here... Perhaps I shouldn't have let you come.
c231_Outpost_Touch_3,I'm here because I missed you.
c231_Gacha_Get_1,"You're so adorable. I'll get rid of anything standing in your way, anything!"
c231_Reinforce_1,Now I can fly to you faster.
c231_Reinforce_2,Ah... Is this a form of love?
c231_Reinforce_3,I'm the only shield you'll need.
c231_Gift_1,"Does this mean... You like me too, darling?"
c231_Gift_2,"With this, it's like you'll always be with me."
c231_Gift_3,A piece of my darling... For me to keep.
c231_Attractive_Up_1,"From now on, I want to be your one and only."
c231_Attractive_Up_2,"We love each other, right?"
c231_Attractive_Up_3,I wish I could sleep by your side every night.
c231_Party_Deploy_1,"I'll protect you, darling."
c231_Field_Touch_1,Did you call my name...?
c231_Field_Go_1,I'll go right away.
c231_Battle_Enter_1,Bring it on.
c231_Battle_Ready_1,Leave everything to me.
c231_Battle_Ready_2,I'm the one to keep you safe.
c231_Battle_Ready_3,Don't worry. Just get behind me.
c231_Reload_1,No time to waste.
c231_Reload_2,I must keep my darling safe...
c231_Reload_3,Hurry up.
c231_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Time to end this.
c231_Ult_Skill_1,I'll chase you to the end of the world.
c231_FullBurst_1,"I usually prefer going solo, but there's no other choice."
c231_Kill_Monster_1,Die.
c231_Kill_Monster_2,Neutralized.
c231_Kill_Monster_3,Be gone!
c231_Damage_1,... Ugh.
c231_Damage_2,No.
c231_Damage_3,Ah!
c231_Die_1,Ugh... No... I can't leave you behind...
c231_Win_1,I knew you couldn't do it without me... right?
c150_Lobby_Touch_1,Such a wonderful breeze... Can you sense its rhythm?
c150_Lobby_Touch_2,Why do people always call me Jukebox?
c150_Lobby_Touch_3,Empty your mind. Be as free as the wind and the waters.
c150_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I wish you and I could stay on the surface and simply... drift. Like the breeze.
c150_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"On the day I finish my journey,
will you come to hear me play once again?"
c150_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I will never forget how you helped me find my love for music once again.
c150_Lobby_Stay_1,Um... Is it okay to play like this?
c150_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I will remember how relaxed I felt in this place, so full of atmosphere. And my anticipation...
 I will reproduce all of this when I play for you."
c150_Outpost_Touch_1,Let the wind carry you.
c150_Outpost_Touch_2,This place isn't nearly as restrictive as the Ark.
c150_Outpost_Touch_3,The acoustics in this Theater are fantastic! Perfect for playing.
c150_Gacha_Get_1,"Together on the battlefield, we will weave a masterful symphony!"
c150_Reinforce_1,I feel like I can play longer.
c150_Reinforce_2,Such an overwhelming power... I can feel the melody emanating from it.
c150_Reinforce_3,This is a big help... Thank you.
c150_Gift_1,This makes me so happy!
c150_Gift_2,"What a lovely gift, it sends my heart into a crescendo!"
c150_Gift_3,"A short sonatina, to express my joy."
c150_Attractive_Up_1,No melody can express this restlessness I feel.
c150_Attractive_Up_2,Can you hear the melody in my heart? It sings for you.
c150_Attractive_Up_3,"One day, I will let you hear the melody that lives inside me."
c150_Party_Deploy_1,We can play a duet together.
c150_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Conductor."
c150_Field_Go_1,I appreciate your advice.
c150_Battle_Enter_1,I hear the sound of war drums.
c150_Battle_Ready_1,The thrill of battle is undeniable.
c150_Battle_Ready_2,I'm going to start playing.
c150_Battle_Ready_3,"I await your instructions, Conductor."
c150_Reload_1,I have to make a few preparations.
c150_Reload_2,I'm tuning my instrument.
c150_Reload_3,Just a little luftpause.
c150_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Conductor!
c150_Ult_Skill_1,This battle shall be my masterpiece!
c150_FullBurst_1,"And now for the chorus, with gusto!"
c150_Kill_Monster_1,The end.
c150_Kill_Monster_2,Luck is on my side.
c150_Kill_Monster_3,The power of music.
c150_Damage_1,"Ah, yes!"
c150_Damage_2,Uh.
c150_Damage_3,Ow.
c150_Die_1,"Now, we have come to the morendo..."
c150_Win_1,What a wonderful denouement!
c022_Lobby_Touch_1,Any chance I could watch another episode? No?
c022_Lobby_Touch_2,"I like plenty of other genres, not just romance."
c022_Lobby_Touch_3,I received a signal to move! M-may I move?
c022_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I can't believe the Commander and I share the same interests...
Feels like I'm in a dream!"
c022_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"C-Commander... I just learned of a lovely cafe from watching TV,
would you like to go there for a coffee with me?"
c022_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I can't thank you enough for how much confidence you've given me. 
You're the best!"
c022_Lobby_Stay_1,"It's not weird if I just stand here, is it? 
Should I be doing something?"
c022_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It looks like you're pretty busy. I can wait for you here.
After all, you've waited before for me to finish watching a TV show!"
c022_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm nearly done with this series! I'll sleep in a second!
c022_Outpost_Touch_2,D-did you call me? How can I help you?
c022_Outpost_Touch_3,Why is the signal so bad in the Outpost?
c022_Gacha_Get_1,I'm picking up a signal... Could it be fate?
c022_Reinforce_1,C-can I really be this strong...?
c022_Reinforce_2,I feel safer! Thank you...
c022_Reinforce_3,I-I will work harder!
c022_Gift_1,I-is that a gift...?
c022_Gift_2,I like it very much... Th-thank you!
c022_Gift_3,M-my heart is racing!
c022_Attractive_Up_1,I-I can't get the commander out of my head... What should I do?
c022_Attractive_Up_2,"We can really have a picture perfect romance, just like in the movies!"
c022_Attractive_Up_3,Commander! I've sent you a love signal!
c022_Party_Deploy_1,M-may I go with you?
c022_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c022_Field_Go_1,We will move according to the signal received.
c022_Battle_Enter_1,E-enemy ahead! Proceed with caution!
c022_Battle_Ready_1,"C'mon Signal, you can do this!"
c022_Battle_Ready_2,Battle start!
c022_Battle_Ready_3,E-enemy ahead!
c022_Reload_1,Faster...!
c022_Reload_2,Reload... Please...!
c022_Reload_3,I-I'll reload!
c022_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's the signal!
c022_Ult_Skill_1,D-danger! Please! Requesting backup!
c022_FullBurst_1,So shoot... just like this?
c022_Kill_Monster_1,T-target down!
c022_Kill_Monster_2,I made it!
c022_Kill_Monster_3,Did I take down the target...?
c022_Damage_1,Ahh!
c022_Damage_2,Agh!
c022_Damage_3,Hrrrrnngh!
c022_Die_1,I-I'm sorry I couldn't be much help...
c022_Win_1,V-victory!
c030_Lobby_Touch_1,"As soon as I touch your hand, I get all drowsy. Pretty weird, don't ya think?"
c030_Lobby_Touch_2,Looks like I've been shedding a lot recently!
c030_Lobby_Touch_3,"I look a lot like a puppy, don't ya think?"
c030_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Commander! I cracked the case today! Aren't I a good girl?!
c030_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If I apprehend the suspect today, you need to give me some extra head pats, all right?"
c030_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,The Commander will let you tease him for being a puppy. But not too much.
c030_Lobby_Stay_1,Aaaah~ Why hasn't Commander shown up...
c030_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I wonder where the Commander is? I thought we agreed the two of us would go on patrol today.
c030_Outpost_Touch_1,"Do you want to come to the police station? I won't arrest you, pinky swear!"
c030_Outpost_Touch_2,"I just feel like kicking back and relaxing, ya know?"
c030_Outpost_Touch_3,"Wowzers, why are there so many cases in such a small place? Pretty weird, don't ya think?"
c030_Gacha_Get_1,"*Sniff* If there's anything you can trust, it's this snout of mine! I'll protect you!"
c030_Reinforce_1,"Wowee, I'll take good care of it!"
c030_Reinforce_2,"My nose has become more sensitive, don't ya think?"
c030_Reinforce_3,"Thank you for your support, Commander!"
c030_Gift_1,This is my favorite!
c030_Gift_2,It's... a gift! Thanks!
c030_Gift_3,Whoaaa! Thank you for this!
c030_Attractive_Up_1,"I can't express how grateful I am, Commander. You can count on me!"
c030_Attractive_Up_2,The Commander. My job... I'm equally fond of both!
c030_Attractive_Up_3,You're under arrest... for stealing my heart!
c030_Party_Deploy_1,Mind if I join?
c030_Field_Touch_1,Where should I go?
c030_Field_Go_1,"Position confirmed, let's go!"
c030_Battle_Enter_1,Moving!
c030_Battle_Ready_1,Enemy sighted!
c030_Battle_Ready_2,Engaging!
c030_Battle_Ready_3,Let's get this show on the road!
c030_Reload_1,Reloading!
c030_Reload_2,Let me catch my breath!
c030_Reload_3,Taking cover!
c030_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready to strike!
c030_Ult_Skill_1,Police officer Poli is here! Let me be your escort!
c030_FullBurst_1,I'll get them all!
c030_Kill_Monster_1,Suspects detained!
c030_Kill_Monster_2,That should do it!
c030_Kill_Monster_3,Searching for next target.
c030_Damage_1,Argh!
c030_Damage_2,Uh...
c030_Damage_3,Arh!
c030_Die_1,Erm... I'm just going to take a short break...
c030_Win_1,"You did well, Commander!"
c032_Lobby_Touch_1,A.C.P.U. will always be here to protect the citizens of the Ark.
c032_Lobby_Touch_2,You called? What do you need?
c032_Lobby_Touch_3,You call me over here for nothing? Can you please not do that?
c032_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I will continue to protect you, Commander!"
c032_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,May I hug you?!
c032_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You and Poli are the most important people in my life!
c032_Lobby_Stay_1,Excuse me... is the Commander here?
c032_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Where have you been, Commander?
I waited for your return!"
c032_Outpost_Touch_1,We do have iron grate windows. Not sure how sturdy they are though.
c032_Outpost_Touch_2,Nice weather. I'm feeling strong!
c032_Outpost_Touch_3,Complaints keep piling into the police station. I just don't get it.
c032_Gacha_Get_1,I'll make more effort! Wow! I'm full of power!
c032_Reinforce_1,Thank you for your support!
c032_Reinforce_2,I'm growing stronger! I really am!
c032_Reinforce_3,I feel like I'm on top of the world!
c032_Gift_1,Thank you for your gift!
c032_Gift_2,Err... Is someone in my position even allowed to accept this?
c032_Gift_3,"You are the best, Commander. I'm so happy."
c032_Attractive_Up_1,"I'll do everything I can to make your life easier, Commander."
c032_Attractive_Up_2,Staying with you always gives me this feeling... I don't know how to describe it!
c032_Attractive_Up_3,"You have complete trust in me, don't you? And you're willing to rely on me? I'm so glad to hear that!"
c032_Party_Deploy_1,Go Miranda go!
c032_Field_Touch_1,Where do you need me?
c032_Field_Go_1,To the target!
c032_Battle_Enter_1,"Enemies, straight ahead!"
c032_Battle_Ready_1,"I will protect you, Commander!"
c032_Battle_Ready_2,I will try my best!
c032_Battle_Ready_3,Enemy sighted!
c032_Reload_1,"Reloading! I repeat, reloading!"
c032_Reload_2,Find cover!
c032_Reload_3,I'm going to reload.
c032_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,All right! I'm feeling it now!
c032_Ult_Skill_1,"Harder! Harder, I said! Yes, the power!"
c032_FullBurst_1,Push it to the limit!
c032_Kill_Monster_1,I did it!
c032_Kill_Monster_2,I win!
c032_Kill_Monster_3,Who's next?
c032_Damage_1,Gah!
c032_Damage_2,Ugh!
c032_Damage_3,Ouch!
c032_Die_1,Guess I didn't work hard enough...
c032_Win_1,We won! We actually won!
c070_Lobby_Touch_1,"I'm sorry, I still have work to attend to."
c070_Lobby_Touch_2,"I'm feeling a bit overworked, but it's nothing I'm not used to."
c070_Lobby_Touch_3,I need to be ready at all times.
c070_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,... Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
c070_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,The coffee just doesn't taste the same without the Commander here.
c070_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,... Won't you go with me for a walk today?
c070_Lobby_Stay_1,"You look busy.
Better busy than idle."
c070_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Are you... making me a cup of coffee?
c070_Outpost_Touch_1,The railway station facilities here are better than I expected.
c070_Outpost_Touch_2,Need to schedule during my time at the Outpost... Oh did you call me?
c070_Outpost_Touch_3,I can see the AZX after I reach the railway station.
c070_Gacha_Get_1,I choose the best route and make sure it's delivered safely.
c070_Reinforce_1,This may make me more efficient at work.
c070_Reinforce_2,AZX is picking up speed.
c070_Reinforce_3,There's no such thing as being overprepared.
c070_Gift_1,"Thank you, I'll put it to good use!"
c070_Gift_2,"You clearly put a lot of thought into this, thank you."
c070_Gift_3,"I'll repay you someday, I promise."
c070_Attractive_Up_1,"How frustrating! Even when I'm working, I can't get the Commander out of my head."
c070_Attractive_Up_2,I can't focus on work... I keep thinking about the Commander.
c070_Attractive_Up_3,I don't get it... I feel so nervous when I'm around the Commander.
c070_Party_Deploy_1,It's ready to run.
c070_Field_Touch_1,Which way should we go?
c070_Field_Go_1,Route established. Ready to go.
c070_Battle_Enter_1,Obstacles up ahead! Prepare for impact!
c070_Battle_Ready_1,I'll get rid of it at once.
c070_Battle_Ready_2,"Enemy spotted, look alive!"
c070_Battle_Ready_3,Let me show you what the AZX can do.
c070_Reload_1,Straighten out before starting.
c070_Reload_2,Reloading.
c070_Reload_3,Start when you are ready.
c070_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,AZX is ready!
c070_Ult_Skill_1,Aim for the target! Maximum output! Fire!
c070_FullBurst_1,Send them back to hell where they belong!
c070_Kill_Monster_1,Processing finished.
c070_Kill_Monster_2,Next.
c070_Kill_Monster_3,Clearing obstacles.
c070_Damage_1,Ah!
c070_Damage_2,Urgh...
c070_Damage_3,Ugh...
c070_Die_1,Sorry... the train is temporarily inoperable.
c070_Win_1,It was a great ride.
c071_Lobby_Touch_1,What's next?
c071_Lobby_Touch_2,"This baby right here is Crimson Crusaders. Pretty sweet, huh?"
c071_Lobby_Touch_3,You don't have to tell me. I already know I'm awesome.
c071_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Huh. I'm an adult now. I don't eat candy.
c071_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Do I catch your eye?
c071_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"What do you think, Commander? I've come a long way, haven't I? I bet I don't look like a little kid anymore!"
c071_Lobby_Stay_1,"Huh, what on earth is taking so long? Come back or I'm leaving!"
c071_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Where are you? You said you wouldn't leave me alone...
c071_Outpost_Touch_1,Looks like I'm the only one here who knows what they're doing.
c071_Outpost_Touch_2,I'm bored. I'm going to see the AZX.
c071_Outpost_Touch_3,Are you coming to the railway station? Let's ride the AZX together!
c071_Gacha_Get_1,You're lucky to have a Nikke like me who knows what she's doing.
c071_Reinforce_1,Excellent! I've become more powerful!
c071_Reinforce_2,"Wow, getting stronger feels incredible!"
c071_Reinforce_3,Is that all? I want to keep getting stronger.
c071_Gift_1,Is it really for me?
c071_Gift_2,Thank... Thank you... Commander.
c071_Gift_3,"Well, thank you for your kindness."
c071_Attractive_Up_1,"I don't understand...whenever I see the Commander, I can't think straight! My heart feels like it's about to beat out of my chest."
c071_Attractive_Up_2,"Oh, what's happening? My heart feels funny..."
c071_Attractive_Up_3,"You like me too, don't you Commander?"
c071_Party_Deploy_1,"Well then, I'll just join this team!"
c071_Field_Touch_1,What? Wh-what's wrong?!
c071_Field_Go_1,You want me to go there?
c071_Battle_Enter_1,"Be careful, enemy incoming!"
c071_Battle_Ready_1,Let me show you what I can do!
c071_Battle_Ready_2,"I'm gonna try a few things out, that's all."
c071_Battle_Ready_3,Get behind me! I'll protect you!
c071_Reload_1,"Finding a cover is part of strategy too, you know!"
c071_Reload_2,"I'm still reloading, give me a second!"
c071_Reload_3,"Drats, out of bullets!"
c071_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm coming!
c071_Ult_Skill_1,"I'll take care of this, and you can take that to the bank!"
c071_FullBurst_1,You are going down!
c071_Kill_Monster_1,"You can run, but you can't hide!"
c071_Kill_Monster_2,You're done for!
c071_Kill_Monster_3,"C'mon, give me a real challenge!"
c071_Damage_1,Ouch!
c071_Damage_2,Enough!
c071_Damage_3,Ah!
c071_Die_1,I'm sorry... I'm so useless...
c071_Win_1,Nothing can stand in my way!
c072_Lobby_Touch_1,"Welcome! Another busy day for you, I see."
c072_Lobby_Touch_2,Care for some strawberry candy?
c072_Lobby_Touch_3,Why don't you rest for a while? No use in running when you can barely walk!
c072_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I wonder if my little brother will be as outstanding as you.
c072_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You can only buy this Splendamin at the train station! It's delicious, want some more?"
c072_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Being held by you feels... nice.
c072_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hey, don't hide! I've got candies for you!"
c072_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Commander, let's sing a song!
Ride the AZX rails, destination: Happiness!"
c072_Outpost_Touch_1,"When you come to the train station, strawberry candies are on me!"
c072_Outpost_Touch_2,There's the AZX! Schwooooosh! There it goes!
c072_Outpost_Touch_3,"Commander, are you bored?"
c072_Gacha_Get_1,How about some candy for the road?
c072_Reinforce_1,"Heehee, thanks for your help!"
c072_Reinforce_2,I'll try and get stronger so I can protect you.
c072_Reinforce_3,I really appreciate all that you do for me.
c072_Gift_1,Is this for me? You're kidding!
c072_Gift_2,"Thank you, Commander!"
c072_Gift_3,I'm so happy!
c072_Attractive_Up_1,"Every day with you is a happy one, Commander."
c072_Attractive_Up_2,I'm so lucky to have you around.
c072_Attractive_Up_3,"I want to get on the AZX with you, and travel the whole world!"
c072_Party_Deploy_1,"Oh boy, oh boy, it's my turn!"
c072_Field_Touch_1,"Heehee, are you calling me?"
c072_Field_Go_1,"Yes, on my way!"
c072_Battle_Enter_1,Wowzers! Take care of yourselves everyone!
c072_Battle_Ready_1,Just calm down and give it another shot.
c072_Battle_Ready_2,"Be careful, everyone."
c072_Battle_Ready_3,Time to get serious.
c072_Reload_1,Reload?
c072_Reload_2,Calm down...
c072_Reload_3,Dust yourself off and give it another go!
c072_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready!
c072_Ult_Skill_1,May victory be ours!
c072_FullBurst_1,Charge!
c072_Kill_Monster_1,Phew... That's settled.
c072_Kill_Monster_2,Let's put our backs into it.
c072_Kill_Monster_3,Let's get a few more hits in!
c072_Damage_1,Argh.
c072_Damage_2,Ow.
c072_Damage_3,Argh!
c072_Die_1,"Aw shucks, they got the best of my strawberry candies..."
c072_Win_1,"Wowee, we won! Oh happy day, Commander!"
c080_Lobby_Touch_1,What'll it be? I'll have it done in a jiffy!
c080_Lobby_Touch_2,There's nothing mightier than Raze & Rebuild!
c080_Lobby_Touch_3,"If there are any malfunctions or broken parts, let me know!"
c080_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,It's a pleasure to work with you!
c080_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Boss! Are the loans all taken care of?
c080_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Business is booming, thanks to you!"
c080_Lobby_Stay_1,"Is the Boss not here? I better get to work then, lots to do."
c080_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Boss! When are you coming? We gotta get to work. 
There's much to be done with the class manager."
c080_Outpost_Touch_1,This outpost needs to be reworked from the ground up... I love it!
c080_Outpost_Touch_2,"Pretty cool workshop, huh? Built it ourselves!"
c080_Outpost_Touch_3,Is that a broken part over there? I'm on it!
c080_Gacha_Get_1,"Saw teeth... entire buildings... you name it, I can make it for you, and fast!"
c080_Reinforce_1,Getting closer to completion!
c080_Reinforce_2,Woo-hoo! My power is increasing!
c080_Reinforce_3,I feel like I could build a skyscraper in the blink of an eye!
c080_Gift_1,"Wait, this isn't a mission letter... Is this a gift?"
c080_Gift_2,So you were thinking about me? Thanks!
c080_Gift_3,Just for me? This means so much to me!
c080_Attractive_Up_1,My heart seems to be beating faster lately... Hope it's not a malfunction...
c080_Attractive_Up_2,I feel just like I do whenever we finish constructing a building.
c080_Attractive_Up_3,"All these strange emotions I've been feeling... they make my heart race.
If only you could repair emotions!"
c080_Party_Deploy_1,Where is the next site?
c080_Field_Touch_1,Just name a troop!
c080_Field_Go_1,I'm going!
c080_Battle_Enter_1,Let's do this!
c080_Battle_Ready_1,Looks there's a lot to repair!
c080_Battle_Ready_2,Destruction is also my specialty!
c080_Battle_Ready_3,Let's roll!
c080_Reload_1,Reloaded!
c080_Reload_2,Excuse me!
c080_Reload_3,Be back in a second!
c080_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready!
c080_Ult_Skill_1,Raze & Rebuild are all-powerful tools!
c080_FullBurst_1,Now! Fight to the death!!
c080_Kill_Monster_1,Gotcha!
c080_Kill_Monster_2,I did it!
c080_Kill_Monster_3,See?
c080_Damage_1,That hurt!
c080_Damage_2,Ugh!
c080_Damage_3,Gah!
c080_Die_1,"Sorry, if you will excuse me."
c080_Win_1,Is it enough for fighting?
c091_Lobby_Touch_1,Err... C-can you teach me how to make friends?
c091_Lobby_Touch_2,What am I good at? Hmm... Killing?
c091_Lobby_Touch_3,I don't care if you're my Commander. I won't let you make fun of me and call me a crybaby!
c091_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"C-Commander, do you remember what was written down in my diary?"
c091_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I've been laughing non-stop recently... What is happening to me?
c091_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,C-can you take me to watch a movie again?
c091_Lobby_Stay_1,Co... Commander... Commander?
c091_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I can't believe this, the Commander deserted me again!"
c091_Outpost_Touch_1,Did you know that there are all sorts of scary rumors about the armory?
c091_Outpost_Touch_2,"Dear diary, today I spoke to the Commander longer than ever before. Two whole sentences! Not bad, huh?"
c091_Outpost_Touch_3,"Every day, I imagine all the ways I'd love to get back at my tormentors... It's the only thing that gives me inner peace."
c091_Gacha_Get_1,"No, please don't treat me like this... I don't know what I'll end up doing."
c091_Reinforce_1,Th-thank you for standing up for me!
c091_Reinforce_2,I... seem to be getting stronger.
c091_Reinforce_3,Will I be able to kill people more easily from now on?
c091_Gift_1,Is... Is it for me? Really?
c091_Gift_2,... I feel happy.
c091_Gift_3,Do friends often give each other things like this?
c091_Attractive_Up_1,So... does that mean we've become closer friends? Actually... I wish we were closer than this.
c091_Attractive_Up_2,What to do... I miss the Commander even when we see each other all the time.
c091_Attractive_Up_3,Is... is this feeling... love?
c091_Party_Deploy_1,J-just leave it to me!
c091_Field_Touch_1,I'm listening.
c091_Field_Go_1,I-I'm on the move.
c091_Battle_Enter_1,Time to fight.
c091_Battle_Ready_1,I'll wipe you all out.
c091_Battle_Ready_2,My fantasies have finally become reality.
c091_Battle_Ready_3,This won't take long.
c091_Reload_1,Th-there aren't enough bullets.
c091_Reload_2,... Will this do?
c091_Reload_3,Come on!
c091_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm... I'm ready.
c091_Ult_Skill_1,"D-don't come any closer, or... I'll have to kill you all."
c091_FullBurst_1,So... all I have to do is kill them all?
c091_Kill_Monster_1,Enemy down.
c091_Kill_Monster_2,Another enemy down.
c091_Kill_Monster_3,How am I doing?
c091_Damage_1,Eeep!
c091_Damage_2,Aah!
c091_Damage_3,Argh.
c091_Die_1,I-I'm sorry...
c091_Win_1,A-are you proud of me?
c092_Lobby_Touch_1,"Don't talk to me, Weakling."
c092_Lobby_Touch_2,"You and I may be sharing a battlefield, but that doesn't make us equals."
c092_Lobby_Touch_3,What a pathetic bunch of fools.
c092_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I leave my dreams in your hands.
c092_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You must never betray me. Never.
c092_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Not too keen on being called weakling? How about squirt, then?"
c092_Lobby_Stay_1,Now is no time to be playing around.
c092_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Well, don't just stand there like some statue! Do you realize how lucky you are that I'm giving you the time of day?"
c092_Outpost_Touch_1,A true commander never neglects the armory.
c092_Outpost_Touch_2,What am I reading? Intel for the next assignment.
c092_Outpost_Touch_3,I'll accept nothing less than perfection from my team.
c092_Gacha_Get_1,Words alone won't get you to the top.
c092_Reinforce_1,I'm even stronger.
c092_Reinforce_2,Update battle data
c092_Reinforce_3,Better than before.
c092_Gift_1,... Are you trying to bribe me?
c092_Gift_2,Keen observation. What a surprise.
c092_Gift_3,This is... not bad.
c092_Attractive_Up_1,I just saw possibilities in you.
c092_Attractive_Up_2,"You truly are a puny thing, but you make it work."
c092_Attractive_Up_3,You'd better not try to leave me as those scumbags did. I've chosen you.
c092_Party_Deploy_1,"I can't defy orders, can I?"
c092_Field_Touch_1,What's the plan?
c092_Field_Go_1,Moving toward the destination.
c092_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy!
c092_Battle_Ready_1,Time to show these amateurs how it's done.
c092_Battle_Ready_2,Get'em.
c092_Battle_Ready_3,Commencing operation.
c092_Reload_1,Reloading.
c092_Reload_2,Calm down.
c092_Reload_3,Now's not the time.
c092_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Sniping preparations complete.
c092_Ult_Skill_1,I'll put a bullet in every last stinkin' one of you.
c092_FullBurst_1,Total annihilation.
c092_Kill_Monster_1,Neutralized.
c092_Kill_Monster_2,Target is down.
c092_Kill_Monster_3,Great. Next.
c092_Damage_1,Uh.
c092_Damage_2,Damn it.
c092_Damage_3,ughing*
c092_Die_1,Damn it... I'll let you take over from here.
c092_Win_1,Not bad for a weakling.
c101_Lobby_Touch_1,"Heehee, transform."
c101_Lobby_Touch_2,Am I scary? You bet I am!
c101_Lobby_Touch_3,Am I a hero? That's a tough one...
c101_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Yes, it is I, the greatest villain of them all! Bow before me!"
c101_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You want my signature too? Fine, I'll give it to you later."
c101_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,What heinous crimes should I carry out today?
c101_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hahahaha! Hahahahaha! *Cough, cough*"
c101_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,... Where did you go? Don't tell me you're off being evil without me!
c101_Outpost_Touch_1,"My building, hand it over! If you don't have it, then never mind."
c101_Outpost_Touch_2,I like power plants. They give me a tingly feeling.
c101_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place is great! Nice and quiet. Oops, I may have said that too loudly..."
c101_Gacha_Get_1,Heeheehee... Hahaha!
c101_Reinforce_1,Hand over my enemies! Now!
c101_Reinforce_2,Wow... I look pretty scary! Haha!
c101_Reinforce_3,Time to get down to business.
c101_Gift_1,What? Is this... for me?
c101_Gift_2,I want them all! Are these all the offerings you have? Forget it then.
c101_Gift_3,I'll repay you. What would you like? Just name it.
c101_Attractive_Up_1,A moron like you won't pull the wool over my eyes.
c101_Attractive_Up_2,Is it possible for a villain to feel love?
c101_Attractive_Up_3,"You're more than welcome to love me, but don't expect any in return!"
c101_Party_Deploy_1,Let's do this!
c101_Field_Touch_1,What?
c101_Field_Go_1,Are you giving me an order? You best tread lightly.
c101_Battle_Enter_1,Bring it on!
c101_Battle_Ready_1,It's nice to be a hero every once in a while.
c101_Battle_Ready_2,"I need 10 seconds! No, uh, wait, 10 minutes."
c101_Battle_Ready_3,Watch and learn.
c101_Reload_1,"It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it."
c101_Reload_2,"Cover me, and don't get yourself killed!"
c101_Reload_3,"I'll do it slowly, hehe!"
c101_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Hahaahaa!
c101_Ult_Skill_1,There's more where that came from!
c101_FullBurst_1,"Time for the coup de grace! If it fails, forget I said it."
c101_Kill_Monster_1,Heehee!
c101_Kill_Monster_2,Hahaha!
c101_Kill_Monster_3,Die!
c101_Damage_1,Agh!
c101_Damage_2,Ouch!
c101_Damage_3,Ugh!
c101_Die_1,They didn't best me! I just tripped is all!
c101_Win_1,"Did you see that? If not, then just ignore me."
c110_Lobby_Touch_1,"This so-called Ark is nothing but a vessel, and sooner or later, it will sink."
c110_Lobby_Touch_2,The savagery of these outlaws is no worse than your own prejudice.
c110_Lobby_Touch_3,Nikkes and humans are destined to kill each other.
c110_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Your ability is amazing, in every aspect."
c110_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You want to be my friend?
You're not afraid of running afoul of the law, are you?"
c110_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I hope this place doesn't chew you up and spit you out like the others.
I usually don't care about this kind of stuff, but... it's different with you."
c110_Lobby_Stay_1,"This place is dead. I've got to liven it up a bit, make a splash!"
c110_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"There's nothing wrong with flights of fancy, but it's best to keep your feet on the ground and your head out of the clouds."
c110_Outpost_Touch_1,"The Bar is the local watering hole for those freaks, so it has that going for it."
c110_Outpost_Touch_2,"Viper, Jackal. I'm going out. Don't ask why. If you're curious, keep an eye on the news tomorrow."
c110_Outpost_Touch_3,One day in the Outer Rim will silence even the harshest critics of the Outpost.
c110_Gacha_Get_1,"So long as humans exist, so will their irrational ways. Complete extermination is the only solution."
c110_Reinforce_1,What? Am I getting lighter?
c110_Reinforce_2,This is nice.
c110_Reinforce_3,Like shooting fish in a barrel.
c110_Gift_1,Can this be exchanged for weapons?
c110_Gift_2,Thanks.
c110_Gift_3,... Why do you keep giving me gifts?
c110_Attractive_Up_1,You are rather exceptional for a human. It's a shame that I must kill you.
c110_Attractive_Up_2,"If you were one of us, I'd be more than happy to show you some affection.
Don't get it twisted, I'm talking about like what Jackal and I have."
c110_Attractive_Up_3,"And what is it you expect in return for this... 
A big wet kiss?"
c110_Party_Deploy_1,"So if I don't play ball, you paint the walls with my insides? I see how it is."
c110_Field_Touch_1,I'm listening.
c110_Field_Go_1,Can you keep up?
c110_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c110_Battle_Ready_1,Initiate contact?
c110_Battle_Ready_2,Bystanders are not welcome.
c110_Battle_Ready_3,"I'm just cannon fodder to you, aren't I?"
c110_Reload_1,... I grow tired of this.
c110_Reload_2,Reloading.
c110_Reload_3,Out of ammo... Just when things were getting good...
c110_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Go!
c110_Ult_Skill_1,Violence is always the answer.
c110_FullBurst_1,"Ah, the thrill of the hunt!"
c110_Kill_Monster_1,You're no fun.
c110_Kill_Monster_2,"If you want to fight a losing battle, then be my guest."
c110_Kill_Monster_3,Easy-peasy.
c110_Damage_1,Uh.
c110_Damage_2,Urgh!
c110_Damage_3,Ha...
c110_Die_1,"Sorry, but I've got to go."
c110_Win_1,"Happy, you government lap dog?"
c130_Lobby_Touch_1,"If you're ever feeling sick, give me a call."
c130_Lobby_Touch_2,Anything I can help you with?
c130_Lobby_Touch_3,Let me treat you. It won't hurt a bit.
c130_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Don't even think about feigning illness. You won't like me when I'm mad.
c130_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Um... I'm not entirely sure how things got to this point,
but thanks for reliving the past with me, painful as it was."
c130_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Commander, please take care of yourself. 
If you get sick, it would break my heart."
c130_Lobby_Stay_1,"What a relaxing day. 
It's nice not to have any new patients."
c130_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Commander? It's time for your physical, where are you?
You're making my job very difficult by doing this, you know..."
c130_Outpost_Touch_1,Are you feeling sick?
c130_Outpost_Touch_2,The hospital is just ahead. Feel free to stop by and see me.
c130_Outpost_Touch_3,The Outpost is such a peaceful place.
c130_Gacha_Get_1,"TLC for the sick, painful shots for the malingers!"
c130_Reinforce_1,Now I can take care of more patients.
c130_Reinforce_2,"Let's increase the dosage, shall we?"
c130_Reinforce_3,Thank you for all that you've done.
c130_Gift_1,Are these for me?
c130_Gift_2,A gift for me? I'm so happy!
c130_Gift_3,"Thank you, really."
c130_Attractive_Up_1,Would you like your treatment to be more... personalized?
c130_Attractive_Up_2,"Can you lay on the bed~?
I have a shot I prepared especially for you~"
c130_Attractive_Up_3,"I feel that we're getting closer and closer, I'm so happy!"
c130_Party_Deploy_1,Need my help?
c130_Field_Touch_1,Your instructions please.
c130_Field_Go_1,I'll go over and check.
c130_Battle_Enter_1,"Ready or not, here I come!"
c130_Battle_Ready_1,"Wowee, there sure are a lot of them."
c130_Battle_Ready_2,These guys are just like germs.
c130_Battle_Ready_3,I better get started with the treatment.
c130_Reload_1,That was close.
c130_Reload_2,Reloading.
c130_Reload_3,I'll be ready in a jiffy.
c130_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Call me anytime!
c130_Ult_Skill_1,Time for an injection! Still hurt?
c130_FullBurst_1,"Get lost, germs!"
c130_Kill_Monster_1,Hasta la vista!
c130_Kill_Monster_2,Gotta disinfect those germs!
c130_Kill_Monster_3,Heehee.
c130_Damage_1,Urgh!
c130_Damage_2,*Gasp*
c130_Damage_3,Argh!
c130_Die_1,I think... this is as far as I can go...
c130_Win_1,An apple a day keeps the Raptures away!
c131_Lobby_Touch_1,"Good luck today, Commander!"
c131_Lobby_Touch_2,Have you been taking good care of yourself?
c131_Lobby_Touch_3,You've got to keep yourself in tip-top shape!
c131_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Commander, Commander!
Every time I call you, I feel so happy, hee-hee."
c131_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Would you like to go on a date with me today?
I just so happen to have some time off, hee-hee."
c131_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Commander, work is important but you know that rest is important too, right?
Rest is also a kind of work y'know."
c131_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander? We've got work to do.
When are you gonna show up?"
c131_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"C'mon Commander, where are you? I have to admit though, even waiting for him feels nice."
c131_Outpost_Touch_1,It's a super nice day today!
c131_Outpost_Touch_2,How can I put it... It's just that the Outpost feels so... full of life!
c131_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you come for a physical, Commander?"
c131_Gacha_Get_1,"Even if there is only a 1% chance, you can be cured!"
c131_Reinforce_1,Tougher in both body and soul!
c131_Reinforce_2,"I'm stronger, Commander!"
c131_Reinforce_3,It's all thanks to you!
c131_Gift_1,A present for me? Really?
c131_Gift_2,Thank you!
c131_Gift_3,"Wow, I'm so touched!"
c131_Attractive_Up_1,The Commander... is someone I can see myself falling in love with.
c131_Attractive_Up_2,"I want to spend more time with you.
May I get closer to you?"
c131_Attractive_Up_3,"It's a great pleasure knowing you, Commander!"
c131_Party_Deploy_1,Let's step on it!
c131_Field_Touch_1,Present! Awaiting your orders!
c131_Field_Go_1,Should I go over there?
c131_Battle_Enter_1,Enemy incoming!
c131_Battle_Ready_1,Keep it up!
c131_Battle_Ready_2,We can win!
c131_Battle_Ready_3,I hope nobody gets hurt!
c131_Reload_1,Reloading!
c131_Reload_2,This is tougher than I expected.
c131_Reload_3,I can do this!
c131_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's my turn!
c131_Ult_Skill_1,Don't give up! Let me help!
c131_FullBurst_1,Come on! We can defeat them!
c131_Kill_Monster_1,Yeah! I made it!
c131_Kill_Monster_2,Did you see that?
c131_Kill_Monster_3,W-we made it!
c131_Damage_1,Ow!
c131_Damage_2,Aah!
c131_Damage_3,Ow!
c131_Die_1,"Sorry, I thought we could win..."
c131_Win_1,W-we won! We did it!
c141_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey Punk, what's your problem? Come here and say it to my face!"
c141_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hey, are you any good at fighting?"
c141_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'll take you all on! That oughta scare 'em, don't you think?"
c141_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Do you want some milk coffee?
I brought it myself just for you!"
c141_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I want to know everything about you, no matter how trivial it is."
c141_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,What? Why are you poking me all the time? Are you challenging me to a duel?
c141_Lobby_Stay_1,Why call me here for nothing? I'm a busy woman!
c141_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I can practice punching here, so don't mind me.
But considering how long you kept me waiting, I'd say you owe me dinner!"
c141_Outpost_Touch_1,Milk Coffee is our best seller at the coffee shop!
c141_Outpost_Touch_2,Looks like we've got a couple unwelcome customers. Allow me to show them the door.
c141_Outpost_Touch_3,"When I'm here, I can be myself. I don't have to worry about what expectations other people have of me."
c141_Gacha_Get_1,"Leave the fighting to me, I'll show them what for!"
c141_Reinforce_1,Powering up!
c141_Reinforce_2,"All right, who wants some of this?!"
c141_Reinforce_3,I'm ready to rock!
c141_Gift_1,Hmm? Is this a gift? Wow!
c141_Gift_2,"Thanks, Pal. I'll be sure not to waste it."
c141_Gift_3,"What are you giving me a gift for? Well, thanks anyway."
c141_Attractive_Up_1,"If anyone is giving you a hard time, just let me know and I'll set them straight."
c141_Attractive_Up_2,I'm curious about what your real personality is.
c141_Attractive_Up_3,"If you're the one drinking it, then the milk coffee is on me."
c141_Party_Deploy_1,"All right, let's do this!"
c141_Field_Touch_1,What do you want me to do?
c141_Field_Go_1,Setting out!
c141_Battle_Enter_1,"You're not going anywhere, you twerps!"
c141_Battle_Ready_1,No... you're dead meat!
c141_Battle_Ready_2,Time to turn it up to 11!
c141_Battle_Ready_3,"C'mon, give me all you've got!"
c141_Reload_1,"Hmph, you just wait and see."
c141_Reload_2,"Come on, come on, come on!"
c141_Reload_3,I'm in the zone!
c141_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Right now!
c141_Ult_Skill_1,Try this one on for size!
c141_FullBurst_1,Go back to hell where you belong!
c141_Kill_Monster_1,Nice!
c141_Kill_Monster_2,Hah hah!
c141_Kill_Monster_3,I almost feel sorry for you... but not quite!
c141_Damage_1,Ow!
c141_Damage_2,Damn it.
c141_Damage_3,Ugh!
c141_Die_1,I didn't lose! This is a tactical withdrawal.
c141_Win_1,"Another victory for us, thanks to me!"
c171_Lobby_Touch_1,What? You got something to say to me?
c171_Lobby_Touch_2,"The only way the Ark can continue to function, is under the Central Government's protection. Don't forget that."
c171_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you're not here to help me with some of this work, then I can do without the remarks on my appearance."
c171_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Listen Newbie, if any of the top brass set their sights on you, it will be a real headache for us, 
so look after yourself."
c171_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'll listen to anything you have to say.
c171_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Don't do my work for me like last time,
just take care of yourself."
c171_Lobby_Stay_1,What are you doing? Quit dawdling and get moving!
c171_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"What's troubling you? You can tell me.
I can't help you if you don't tell me anything."
c171_Outpost_Touch_1,Get rid of those Nikkes who are causing a scene in the Courthouse.
c171_Outpost_Touch_2,They call this a Courthouse?
c171_Outpost_Touch_3,The weather here is so nice... It's making me sleepy...
c171_Gacha_Get_1,Looks like things just got a whole lot more complicated.
c171_Reinforce_1,"I appreciate your support, but I assume it comes at a price?"
c171_Reinforce_2,I'll do everything I can to show that your trust in me isn't misplaced.
c171_Reinforce_3,You must have gone through a lot to upgrade me to this level.
c171_Gift_1,Is it for me? Why?
c171_Gift_2,"Thanks... Agh, I'm not used to saying things like this."
c171_Gift_3,"Just for the record, nothing's changed just because you've given me this."
c171_Attractive_Up_1,No funny business while I'm around. It'll only distract me.
c171_Attractive_Up_2,"Gah, why do you make me so worried all the time?! So annoying!"
c171_Attractive_Up_3,"I hate owing other people favors.
Be it out of kindness or any other emotion, if you did something for me, I guarantee that I will repay you in kind."
c171_Party_Deploy_1,Ready to go?
c171_Field_Touch_1,What is it?
c171_Field_Go_1,Understood.
c171_Battle_Enter_1,Entering the battle.
c171_Battle_Ready_1,Don't worry. We've got this.
c171_Battle_Ready_2,"You'll be the commander, Newbie."
c171_Battle_Ready_3,Battle start.
c171_Reload_1,This is taking longer than I expected.
c171_Reload_2,"How are you holding up, Newbie?"
c171_Reload_3,Let me reload and I'll be right there.
c171_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Newbie!
c171_Ult_Skill_1,I've got a lot on my plate right now. Get the hell out of my way!
c171_FullBurst_1,I refuse to work overtime! Be gone!
c171_Kill_Monster_1,Target down.
c171_Kill_Monster_2,Where's the next target?
c171_Kill_Monster_3,Feels nice to blow off some steam.
c171_Damage_1,Hmph.
c171_Damage_2,Damn it.
c171_Damage_3,Ow!
c171_Die_1,"Damn... Sorry about that, Newbie."
c171_Win_1,Mission clear. Good job.
c172_Lobby_Touch_1,"As long as you're with me, Commander, I feel safe."
c172_Lobby_Touch_2,Is something on your mind?
c172_Lobby_Touch_3,Oh. That feels quite nice.
c172_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Wanna go see the kitten?
c172_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I always have such fun spending time with you.
c172_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Your hand is so warm. Can you... touch me a little more?
c172_Lobby_Stay_1,I wanna go see the kitty.
c172_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is the Commander here? Guess not...
c172_Outpost_Touch_1,"Commander, will you... drop by the Courthouse when you have time?"
c172_Outpost_Touch_2,What is a Courthouse doing in the Outpost?
c172_Outpost_Touch_3,"It's smaller than the Ark, but fully equipped."
c172_Gacha_Get_1,Please don't let me be abandoned again...
c172_Reinforce_1,I feel safe now.
c172_Reinforce_2,Thank you for helping me.
c172_Reinforce_3,"You must have put your heart and soul into it... Thank you, Commander!"
c172_Gift_1,Th-thank you!
c172_Gift_2,But... I don't have anything to give in return...
c172_Gift_3,Is this really for me?
c172_Attractive_Up_1,I'm a little scared... I think I'm starting to get attached.
c172_Attractive_Up_2,Is this all just a wonderful dream?
c172_Attractive_Up_3,We've gotten closer... but I may end up regretting it.
c172_Party_Deploy_1,Preparation finished.
c172_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting instructions.
c172_Field_Go_1,I will do your bidding.
c172_Battle_Enter_1,"Take care, Commander!"
c172_Battle_Ready_1,This place is dangerous. Let's go somewhere safe.
c172_Battle_Ready_2,Commencing battle.
c172_Battle_Ready_3,Thanks in advance.
c172_Reload_1,Let me suit up and I'll be right out.
c172_Reload_2,... I must go back...
c172_Reload_3,Reload...
c172_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c172_Ult_Skill_1,Please. It's for everyone!
c172_FullBurst_1,I'll give it my all!
c172_Kill_Monster_1,Cleared.
c172_Kill_Monster_2,Target re-selected.
c172_Kill_Monster_3,Target seems to have been cleared.
c172_Damage_1,Uh.
c172_Damage_2,Argh!
c172_Damage_3,Ow!
c172_Die_1,This task is too difficult for me... I'm sorry!
c172_Win_1,We won... What a blessing!
c180_Lobby_Touch_1,"Eyes on me, you fools!"
c180_Lobby_Touch_2,"I am Guillotine de Mephisto, the Guardian of Balance."
c180_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm about to cut loose, think you can handle it?"
c180_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You are my assistant, therefore you must obey me.
I will protect you, no matter what happens."
c180_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Once, I was trapped in the prison they call ""loneliness"".
But after being with you, I have freed myself from those fetters!"
c180_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Whenever I see you, my heart starts to race.
Perhaps I need to see a doctor?"
c180_Lobby_Stay_1,"Calm down, One-Winged Dark Lord. 
Your powers are no use here."
c180_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"The One-Winged Dark Lord does not stir in your presence.
It seems to have accepted you."
c180_Outpost_Touch_1,No one could ever understand me. I'm destined to be alone.
c180_Outpost_Touch_2,Those people look suspicious. Are they from the Big O?
c180_Outpost_Touch_3,"If you want to hide from the Big O, there's no better place than the Church. They wouldn't dream of stepping foot in there."
c180_Gacha_Get_1,Aren't you curious about what I've got here in my right eye?
c180_Reinforce_1,Heh heh. I can feel the power surging through my body.
c180_Reinforce_2,Hold up...I've got a pang in my eye.
c180_Reinforce_3,"Great, now the Big O will really have it out for me."
c180_Gift_1,"Wait, is this... what I've been looking for all this time?"
c180_Gift_2,"What is this, some kind of bribe? Well... a smart move I suppose."
c180_Gift_3,"I know, I know... You don't have to thank me."
c180_Attractive_Up_1,You may be the only person who understands me... My solitude...
c180_Attractive_Up_2,"It feels like the darkness inside me has been dispelled.
You haven't cast any spells on me, have you?"
c180_Attractive_Up_3,I've decided to show you who I am. All of me.
c180_Party_Deploy_1,You want me over there? That could be arranged.
c180_Field_Touch_1,What is it?
c180_Field_Go_1,I've got a bad feeling about this!
c180_Battle_Enter_1,Let's get down to business.
c180_Battle_Ready_1,Heh heh... You won't like me when I get angry.
c180_Battle_Ready_2,This won't end well for you.
c180_Battle_Ready_3,"Let's have some fun, shall we?"
c180_Reload_1,Gotta reload.
c180_Reload_2,Wait a second.
c180_Reload_3,Careful.
c180_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Now!
c180_Ult_Skill_1,"Super, Ultra, Wyrmblast!"
c180_FullBurst_1,Ultra super-duper combo attack!!
c180_Kill_Monster_1,Ain't nothing to it.
c180_Kill_Monster_2,"Too bad, so sad!"
c180_Kill_Monster_3,What a bunch of clowns.
c180_Damage_1,Errggh!
c180_Damage_2,Tsk!
c180_Damage_3,Yeeoowch!
c180_Die_1,Urgh... Guess we'll have to settle this another time.
c180_Win_1,Score another one for the good guys. Hope the Big O doesn't get wind of it.
c181_Lobby_Touch_1,"Gosh, I can barely breathe in this thing... Huh?"
c181_Lobby_Touch_2,Onion-flavored Splendamin? For real?
c181_Lobby_Touch_3,"Yeah, so what if I took off my mask. I felt like I was suffocating in that thing!"
c181_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It's a wonderful thing to feel like you belong.
It makes me look forward to my days off."
c181_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"They said from then on I could take off my facemask when kissing.
Kiss who? Well... you already know the answer to that."
c181_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I don't know why, but I'm always at ease around you, Commander.
So I'm sticking with you."
c181_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander, we've been assigned a mission... should we go?"
c181_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I don't mean to be rude, but can we speed this up?
I promised my guildmates I'd be back for a raid."
c181_Outpost_Touch_1,"I like the church. It's nice and quiet, and makes for a good hiding spot."
c181_Outpost_Touch_2,The Outpost is perfect for putting your feet up and taking a load off.
c181_Outpost_Touch_3,That looks like a good place for a lie down.
c181_Gacha_Get_1,"What's under the mask? Why, a beautiful face, of course!"
c181_Reinforce_1,I could care less about the upgrades. I just want to lie down.
c181_Reinforce_2,E-excuse me. Is there more?
c181_Reinforce_3,Please give me more next time.
c181_Gift_1,Ah... If only you could give me something else...
c181_Gift_2,A gift? For free?
c181_Gift_3,"Thanks. You're not gonna get on my case if I sell it, are you?"
c181_Attractive_Up_1,I always want to be by your side. I mean that.
c181_Attractive_Up_2,"So, when are you planning on getting a marriage certificate?"
c181_Attractive_Up_3,"I love you.
Sorry, was that too sudden? Nevertheless, I still love you."
c181_Party_Deploy_1,Me? Do I have to?
c181_Field_Touch_1,Huh? Me?
c181_Field_Go_1,Carry me...
c181_Battle_Enter_1,"Time to fight, I suppose."
c181_Battle_Ready_1,Let's get this over with.
c181_Battle_Ready_2,"Before we begin, Commander, can I possibly have a cookie?"
c181_Battle_Ready_3,If only there was someone else to take my place...
c181_Reload_1,I'll reload.
c181_Reload_2,There should be a reload fairy that takes care of this.
c181_Reload_3,Do I have to reload by myself?
c181_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Mask open.
c181_Ult_Skill_1,"Kotodama, the power hidden within ones words."
c181_FullBurst_1,Everyone's firing all at once... Will anyone notice if I don't?
c181_Kill_Monster_1,Huh? They're down already?
c181_Kill_Monster_2,Target down.
c181_Kill_Monster_3,What a weakling.
c181_Damage_1,Ah!
c181_Damage_2,Urgh!
c181_Damage_3,No!
c181_Die_1,Huh? S-sorry.
c181_Win_1,"Ahh... So annoying... Um, did you hear that?"
c190_Lobby_Touch_1,"Servant, go prepare the afternoon tea."
c190_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hands off. You break it, you buy it."
c190_Lobby_Touch_3,I'm off to find a lost Nikke. Care to join me?
c190_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Huh, the tea you prepared was terrible, but I always think of it."
c190_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Servant, do you want to live with me in the north?"
c190_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Every machine I touch bites the dust, so it's difficult to contact you."
c190_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you neglecting me? 
I have to admit, I've never experienced that before."
c190_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Humph, should I have this much free time, I could have tea with you.
Would you care to join?"
c190_Outpost_Touch_1,Fancy some afternoon tea in the Clothing Store?
c190_Outpost_Touch_2,"Well, it's certainly warmer than it is up north."
c190_Outpost_Touch_3,"Servant, run off to the store and purchase some clothing for me."
c190_Gacha_Get_1,Come to us if you're lost. We'll save you anytime.
c190_Reinforce_1,"Thanks, Servant."
c190_Reinforce_2,This power to save can alleviate the people's suffering.
c190_Reinforce_3,Thanks. I'll put it to good use.
c190_Gift_1,Hmm? Is this some kind of bribe?
c190_Gift_2,"So you're trying to curry favor with me, is that it?"
c190_Gift_3,My affection towards you has been made very clear already.
c190_Attractive_Up_1,"Sure, I have feelings for you. The question is, can you handle it?"
c190_Attractive_Up_2,You ought to appreciate me as much as possible. Don't ever forget that.
c190_Attractive_Up_3,"Servant, if you serve your queen well,
I shall repay you in turn."
c190_Party_Deploy_1,Have you got everything under control?
c190_Field_Touch_1,Where's the target location?
c190_Field_Go_1,Move out.
c190_Battle_Enter_1,Enemy incoming!
c190_Battle_Ready_1,Servant! Are you ready?
c190_Battle_Ready_2,It's time to show them what we're capable of.
c190_Battle_Ready_3,You must be honored to be fighting beside me.
c190_Reload_1,Out of ammo.
c190_Reload_2,Once again.
c190_Reload_3,Reload.
c190_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Servant!
c190_Ult_Skill_1,Now you'll see why they call me The Queen of Snow.
c190_FullBurst_1,Blizzard!
c190_Kill_Monster_1,"Behold, my true power!"
c190_Kill_Monster_2,I've got you now.
c190_Kill_Monster_3,You're dismissed.
c190_Damage_1,Ugh.
c190_Damage_2,Uh.
c190_Damage_3,Oops.
c190_Die_1,This is... tougher than I thought it would be...
c190_Win_1,You survived yet again. That's something worth celebrating.
c200_Lobby_Touch_1,"O-M-G, I have got to have this!"
c200_Lobby_Touch_2,"Everyone knows Royal Road is the ultimate dating hotspot. Why's that? Because there's more brand stores there than you can count, that's why!"
c200_Lobby_Touch_3,"One-hour flash sale, half-off all high heels? I do already own a couple hundred pairs... but what's the harm in a couple more!"
c200_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Oh dear, now I've gone and done it... I went a little overboard buying you some gifts!"
c200_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Hey you fellow shopaholics!
Guess who I've got with me?"
c200_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Sweetie, should we choose a place for our date? We can make a reservation at a restaurant and select a decent hotel... Huh? Are we moving too fast?"
c200_Lobby_Stay_1,"Sweetie, what are you up to? 
Let's go out to make some money that we can splurge on our next shopping spree!"
c200_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm not boring you, am I? I haven't heard a peep out of you."
c200_Outpost_Touch_1,There's some super duper stuff in the Outpost Mall!
c200_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm going to shoot an unboxing video later. Want to say hi to my fans, Sweetie?"
c200_Outpost_Touch_3,"Oh my gosh, this bag... I can't even! Give it to me now!"
c200_Gacha_Get_1,Making a fortune doesn't mean much if you're spending a fortune at the same time!
c200_Reinforce_1,"Whoa, I'm getting stronger!"
c200_Reinforce_2,Now I've got more energy to shop!
c200_Reinforce_3,Upgraded!
c200_Gift_1,"Oh, my. Thank you, Sweetie."
c200_Gift_2,This has been on my wish list for a while!
c200_Gift_3,I... I'm touched...
c200_Attractive_Up_1,"Hey Sweetie, you know how much I care about you, right?"
c200_Attractive_Up_2,"Oh Sweetie, I like you so much more than before. At least thiiiisssss much more!"
c200_Attractive_Up_3,"Now it's the moment of truth! If I had to choose between you and shopping? It will be extremely painful to give up shopping, but I'd still choose you!"
c200_Party_Deploy_1,Leave it to me!
c200_Field_Touch_1,What's the plan?
c200_Field_Go_1,On my way!
c200_Battle_Enter_1,Let's get started!
c200_Battle_Ready_1,"The sooner we're done here, the sooner I can go shopping!"
c200_Battle_Ready_2,"Hot stuff, coming through!"
c200_Battle_Ready_3,"Money is power, after all!"
c200_Reload_1,Reloading.
c200_Reload_2,Umm... Yeah.
c200_Reload_3,Preparing.
c200_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Cash Cannon is ready to go!
c200_Ult_Skill_1,Shopaholic-shot!
c200_FullBurst_1,Last year's fashion. Time to go!
c200_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c200_Kill_Monster_2,Lucky!
c200_Kill_Monster_3,Perfect shot!
c200_Damage_1,Ow!
c200_Damage_2,Ouch!
c200_Damage_3,Heh...
c200_Die_1,"Uh, uh... I could have done better."
c200_Win_1,"When it comes to dominating the competition, nothing beats cold hard cash!"
c201_Lobby_Touch_1,"Listen Rookie, two for the price of one is as good as you're going to get."
c201_Lobby_Touch_2,"We do honest business here. I'm serious! Let me guess, you've been burned in the past, yes?"
c201_Lobby_Touch_3,"Why are you always so handsy? You're not interested in me, are you?"
c201_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Keeping your eyes peeled for any opportunities is something any true entrepreneur should be doing.
c201_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Do you think I will only want to do business with you?
I'm interested in other things as well."
c201_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You are the perfect candidate to be my secretary.
c201_Lobby_Stay_1,Are you using a calculator? Why don't you say something?
c201_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"While you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs, prices are rising and shares are fluctuating. You're bound to lose money unless you get up and do something."
c201_Outpost_Touch_1,"Let's start a business, how about it?"
c201_Outpost_Touch_2,I think today's a good day to bring in some customers.
c201_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you heard? I've got a screw loose, because... I must be insane for offering such amazing deals!"
c201_Gacha_Get_1,"Come to our store if you need anything. We have everything, except for what we don't have!"
c201_Reinforce_1,Pleasure doing business with you.
c201_Reinforce_2,I see you're not shy about throwing money around.
c201_Reinforce_3,"This feeling, it's... nice."
c201_Gift_1,Is this for me? Thanks!
c201_Gift_2,How did you know I like this kind of thing?
c201_Gift_3,"You've really got a good head on your shoulders, Rookie."
c201_Attractive_Up_1,"You know Rookie, you're kinda cute every once in a while."
c201_Attractive_Up_2,What? Have you made up your mind to take things to the next level?
c201_Attractive_Up_3,"Are you seducing me? You're a player to the core, and you can't convince me otherwise."
c201_Party_Deploy_1,Come and make a fortune.
c201_Field_Touch_1,Need me for something?
c201_Field_Go_1,I'm on my way!
c201_Battle_Enter_1,The battle's begun!
c201_Battle_Ready_1,"Come and make a fortune, Rookie."
c201_Battle_Ready_2,"The sooner I can wrap this up, the sooner I can leave."
c201_Battle_Ready_3,How about I give them a little taste of what I can do?
c201_Reload_1,I'm reloading.
c201_Reload_2,Reloading at once.
c201_Reload_3,Gimme a break!
c201_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Right now, Rookie!"
c201_Ult_Skill_1,"Everyone has their price, and I'm about to cash you out."
c201_FullBurst_1,Time to wrap things up!
c201_Kill_Monster_1,One down.
c201_Kill_Monster_2,Easy-peasy!
c201_Kill_Monster_3,Like taking candy from a baby.
c201_Damage_1,Ah!
c201_Damage_2,Plz!
c201_Damage_3,Ah...
c201_Die_1,I'm bowing out for now... Sorry.
c201_Win_1,Is that the best you've got? You've got to be kidding me.
c202_Lobby_Touch_1,*Cough* These KPIs... aren't bad.
c202_Lobby_Touch_2,Transaction complete.
c202_Lobby_Touch_3,"Money makes the world go 'round, dear client."
c202_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"One day, when I'm at the top of the corporate ladder, you can be my special guest."
c202_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"We got our quarterly sales report, but that only figures in sales that are above board, so it's just the tip of the iceberg."
c202_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Wanna hit the bars after work? I'll book us a table.
c202_Lobby_Stay_1,Time is more valuable than money. Never waste time hesitating about anything.
c202_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,So go for a drive together to clear your mind? I just finished tuning my sports car.
c202_Outpost_Touch_1,"Did you know there are spaces in the Outpost Mall exclusively for VIP members? How do I know this, you ask? I am the manager."
c202_Outpost_Touch_2,No one is ever completely innocent.
c202_Outpost_Touch_3,How about swinging by the mall when you're free? I'm sure you'll find something that piques your interest.
c202_Gacha_Get_1,Looking for a good time? Look no further.
c202_Reinforce_1,One step closer to the top.
c202_Reinforce_2,I can start a bigger business.
c202_Reinforce_3,Investments will pay off.
c202_Gift_1,You really don't expect anything in return? Thank you.
c202_Gift_2,It's a wise investment.
c202_Gift_3,Surely you must have some kind of motive in giving me this.
c202_Attractive_Up_1,It seems we have more in common than I expected.
c202_Attractive_Up_2,"If it's with you, then I'm willing to give it a shot...
... What? I was referring to our business dealings."
c202_Attractive_Up_3,"I don't mind being someone a bit forward.
So... how about we go on a cruise this weekend?"
c202_Party_Deploy_1,It should be crystal clear who gets what.
c202_Field_Touch_1,I'm listening.
c202_Field_Go_1,Toward the target point.
c202_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c202_Battle_Ready_1,Let me handle this.
c202_Battle_Ready_2,"Oh, how sweet it would be to have a capable commander."
c202_Battle_Ready_3,"Perfect, I can try out this new product."
c202_Reload_1,Cover me.
c202_Reload_2,Wait till I get my reloading done.
c202_Reload_3,Snipers incoming!
c202_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c202_Ult_Skill_1,Hindrance to business detected. Removing now.
c202_FullBurst_1,"Playtime's over, let's finish this!"
c202_Kill_Monster_1,Nice.
c202_Kill_Monster_2,Processing finished.
c202_Kill_Monster_3,We're on a roll! Let's keep it going!
c202_Damage_1,Urgh!
c202_Damage_2,Ow!
c202_Damage_3,Damn...
c202_Die_1,Preliminary research insufficient.
c202_Win_1,With high risk comes high reward. Isn't that why we fight?
c212_Lobby_Touch_1,Looks like we've got ourselves a mystery!
c212_Lobby_Touch_2,The bathroom door is locked? It must be... a locked room mystery!
c212_Lobby_Touch_3,A detective's intuition comes and goes in an instant.
c212_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Doing detective work with you always brings me great pleasure, Watson!
Let's do it again some time!"
c212_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Hmm... Looking around, the only thing I can see is you, Watson!"
c212_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I have to say, Watson...
It seems that our tastes are quite similar!"
c212_Lobby_Stay_1,Watson? Watson! Where are you?
c212_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hmm, it seems Watson has disappeared...
Time to put my sleuthing skills to the test."
c212_Outpost_Touch_1,Don't disturb me! I'm trying to make a deduction.
c212_Outpost_Touch_2,How long do I have to rummage through this stuff... Ah hah! Found something!
c212_Outpost_Touch_3,Where does a detective's intuition come from? Probably from... the Radio Tower??
c212_Gacha_Get_1,"Wherever there's an unsolved mystery, you can bet I'll be close by!"
c212_Reinforce_1,My power of deduction seems to have improved!
c212_Reinforce_2,Thank you for all your support.
c212_Reinforce_3,"Heh heh, my intuition has become sharper."
c212_Gift_1,I-is this a gift? Interesting.
c212_Gift_2,This gift certainly has piqued my curiosity!
c212_Gift_3,I'm ecstatic!
c212_Attractive_Up_1,Is love something that can be deduced? What I mean is... Better not expose myself.
c212_Attractive_Up_2,If only I could find my magnifying glass to peer inside your mind.
c212_Attractive_Up_3,Do you feel the same way as I? Let me make some deductions.
c212_Party_Deploy_1,Need my sleuthing skills?
c212_Field_Touch_1,Standing by.
c212_Field_Go_1,Oops!! Um... Should I go in person?
c212_Battle_Enter_1,The battle has begun!
c212_Battle_Ready_1,I'll make it quick!
c212_Battle_Ready_2,"Sleuthing skills, activate!"
c212_Battle_Ready_3,I'll show you all what a Nikke detective can do!
c212_Reload_1,Reloading!
c212_Reload_2,Come on!
c212_Reload_3,Hurry up!
c212_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Idea!
c212_Ult_Skill_1,Heh heh heh! Eureka!
c212_FullBurst_1,There's no case I can't crack!
c212_Kill_Monster_1,Consider this case closed!
c212_Kill_Monster_2,Gotcha!
c212_Kill_Monster_3,"That should be all of them, heh heh."
c212_Damage_1,Uh.
c212_Damage_2,Ah!
c212_Damage_3,Ugh!
c212_Die_1,I should have checked harder...
c212_Win_1,"Elementary, my dear Watson!"
c241_Lobby_Touch_1,I'm going to go practice.
c241_Lobby_Touch_2,I came up with a new trick!
c241_Lobby_Touch_3,"Hey Coach, want some bubblegum?"
c241_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I get a lot of letters from the fans asking, ""What's your relationship with the Coach?""
What do you say?"
c241_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"How did skateboard practice go?
Let me know if you're tired, and I'll help you feel better."
c241_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"For this new trick...
You just pop it like this..."
c241_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hey, are you part sloth or something? How come you're not up and about?"
c241_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"... Coach, what are you doing? Hurry up, you promised we'd give the Cruiser board a spin."
c241_Outpost_Touch_1,But... there's no slope at the Outpost?
c241_Outpost_Touch_2,Practicing in the gym is the best! Such a great echo.
c241_Outpost_Touch_3,I'm figuring out some new tricks.
c241_Gacha_Get_1,Check out this new trick!
c241_Reinforce_1,I'm stronger.
c241_Reinforce_2,I can skate faster.
c241_Reinforce_3,I just came up with a neat trick!
c241_Gift_1,"Thanks, Coach."
c241_Gift_2,I'll take good care of it.
c241_Gift_3,Are you...cheering me on?
c241_Attractive_Up_1,"So long as you're by my side Coach, I'm not afraid of failing."
c241_Attractive_Up_2,You always help me overcome my inner doubts.
c241_Attractive_Up_3,It's a blessing to have someone I can trust... Someone that can help me become a better person.
c241_Party_Deploy_1,Need one of my tricks?
c241_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Coach?"
c241_Field_Go_1,On my way.
c241_Battle_Enter_1,Match starts now.
c241_Battle_Ready_1,Full speed.
c241_Battle_Ready_2,Here we go.
c241_Battle_Ready_3,I can try out that new trick I've been working on.
c241_Reload_1,Cover me.
c241_Reload_2,Reloading.
c241_Reload_3,Reload.
c241_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Coach."
c241_Ult_Skill_1,You won't be forgetting this one anytime soon!
c241_FullBurst_1,Behold the power of teamwork.
c241_Kill_Monster_1,KO.
c241_Kill_Monster_2,Easy.
c241_Kill_Monster_3,Faster.
c241_Damage_1,Ow!
c241_Damage_2,Oh!
c241_Damage_3,Uh...
c241_Die_1,I'm bowing out of this one.
c241_Win_1,Practice makes perfect.
c242_Lobby_Touch_1,I'm always sweating up a storm. Not exactly the most convenient thing for an athlete...
c242_Lobby_Touch_2,"Geez... It's sweltering out here... Coach, any chance I can hug you for a bit to cool down?"
c242_Lobby_Touch_3,People like me who get hot easily should eat colder foods!
c242_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I have no choice, I have to win this without you!
Any chance you could slip me some additional supplements? Sigh, never mind."
c242_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"The last time you snuggled up to me, it was so cozy...
Can we cuddle the whole day?"
c242_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'd like to train with you again so I can overcome the heat here. Oh, that's not how it works?"
c242_Lobby_Stay_1,This heat is killing me! Where did Coach go...
c242_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You know the rules! If you don't show up soon, then you owe me 30 minutes of cuddling."
c242_Outpost_Touch_1,"It's like a furnace in here, feels like I'm burning up!
Coach, I need you to cool me down."
c242_Outpost_Touch_2,I wish they'd really crank up the A/C in the gym.
c242_Outpost_Touch_3,"I thought eating ice cream would help, but I haven't noticed any change."
c242_Gacha_Get_1,"Wow, you're like a human refrigerator! Can I... hold you for a while?"
c242_Reinforce_1,Will I not sweat as much now?
c242_Reinforce_2,Is this some kind of new health care product?
c242_Reinforce_3,Hopefully this will prevent me from heating up all the time...
c242_Gift_1,Let... Let me wipe the sweat off my hands first! Thanks!
c242_Gift_2,"Oh great, I sweat even when I'm overjoyed!"
c242_Gift_3,Since you've given me a gift... how about a hug?
c242_Attractive_Up_1,"I wish I could hold you all the time, not just when I need to cool down."
c242_Attractive_Up_2,Can you hug me tighter?
c242_Attractive_Up_3,I like you so much! Really! Not even supplements can match you... I think?
c242_Party_Deploy_1,"Folkwang, reporting for duty!"
c242_Field_Touch_1,Roger that!
c242_Field_Go_1,I'll give it everything I've got!
c242_Battle_Enter_1,I always sweat during a battle!
c242_Battle_Ready_1,"My hands are so sweaty, it feels like my gun is going to slip!"
c242_Battle_Ready_2,Whew... Here we go!
c242_Battle_Ready_3,So... so hot...
c242_Reload_1,So hot... This heat is killing me...
c242_Reload_2,Oh no... My gun is slipping!
c242_Reload_3,I should've eaten more ice cream to cool myself off...
c242_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Give me a look!
c242_Ult_Skill_1,"A/C, here I come!"
c242_FullBurst_1,"H-O-T, hot!"
c242_Kill_Monster_1,So much sweat...
c242_Kill_Monster_2,I've got to hold on just a little longer!
c242_Kill_Monster_3,It's a real scorcher today!
c242_Damage_1,Ow!
c242_Damage_2,Ah...
c242_Damage_3,Ugh...
c242_Die_1,I give up. I'm practically drowning in my own sweat.
c242_Win_1,"I secured this victory with my blood, sweat, and... more sweat!"
c221_Lobby_Touch_1,"Please, oh merciful Creator, bring happiness upon these people."
c221_Lobby_Touch_2,Fill them with your light and bless them with eternal hope.
c221_Lobby_Touch_3,Please allow the rippling muscles of those men fill my dreams.
c221_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,All I want is to remember every moment spent with you. Is that too much to ask?
c221_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Believer, tell me, when can we finally submit to our desire to do whatever we wish?"
c221_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Oh my! Such skillful hands...
Very impressive, as expected."
c221_Lobby_Stay_1,I must go pray. Feel free to call upon me if you have any needs.
c221_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You pretend not to care so that I will let my guard down, is that it?
What if I have a moment of weakness? What will you do to me then?!"
c221_Outpost_Touch_1,"If there is such a thing as Paradise, surely it is this place. I would love to live here."
c221_Outpost_Touch_2,I certainly hope there aren't any graves lying around here.
c221_Outpost_Touch_3,There must be hidden areas all over this place.
c221_Gacha_Get_1,"May the Creator bless you for never losing your faith, even during your darkest hours."
c221_Reinforce_1,It's been quite some time since someone looked after me like this.
c221_Reinforce_2,Oh. You really don't hold back.
c221_Reinforce_3,It would be nice if I was a bit more... well-rounded in certain areas.
c221_Gift_1,"Thank you. May the Creator bless you, Believer."
c221_Gift_2,Would you like to make a donation? Oh... it's for me?
c221_Gift_3,What are you trying to do? It... It can't be...!
c221_Attractive_Up_1,"Believer, you are virtuous. The sooner I tie you down, the better... I mean... F-forget I said anything!"
c221_Attractive_Up_2,"Believer, you must trust your instincts completely."
c221_Attractive_Up_3,"No, I cannot allow myself to be conquered by you like this!"
c221_Party_Deploy_1,I'm always by your side.
c221_Field_Touch_1,I'm ready.
c221_Field_Go_1,"You want me to get on it? W-wait, that didn't come out right..."
c221_Battle_Enter_1,Everybody get ready.
c221_Battle_Ready_1,No one will get hurt.
c221_Battle_Ready_2,I will look over everyone.
c221_Battle_Ready_3,May the Creator bless us.
c221_Reload_1,No! The power of my prayers are declining.
c221_Reload_2,"Sorry, please wait a minute."
c221_Reload_3,May all of us remain standing.
c221_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c221_Ult_Skill_1,"The Garden of Shangri-La, no pain or despair!"
c221_FullBurst_1,Please guide us all to the light!
c221_Kill_Monster_1,Eh?
c221_Kill_Monster_2,My goodness.
c221_Kill_Monster_3,Whoa!
c221_Damage_1,Ow!
c221_Damage_2,Errggh!
c221_Damage_3,*Gasp*
c221_Die_1,I may have fallen... but so long as all of you are safe...
c221_Win_1,"We will also emerge victorious, so long as we never give up hope."
c222_Lobby_Touch_1,"Follow the flow of the breeze, the cloud, and thy heart."
c222_Lobby_Touch_2,Fancy some spirits? It makes for fine bedfellows with the moonlight and the breeze.
c222_Lobby_Touch_3,"Be they current foe, or past woes, my blade shall rend them all asunder."
c222_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"There's naught more pleasurable than imbibing spirits with a kind soul.
... *hic*."
c222_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Should you come to earth, call on me anytime.
Wherever my feet shall trod, I will definitely visit you."
c222_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"My lord, I've found some most valuable wine.
Shall we have a cup in the near future?"
c222_Lobby_Stay_1,Any marvelous wine?
c222_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,♪~ ♬♪~ ♩~
c222_Outpost_Touch_1,A more barren wasteland have I never laid my eyes upon.
c222_Outpost_Touch_2,"My lord, farm land is what we are in most dire need of here."
c222_Outpost_Touch_3,"I would rather soon part from here, for there is no moon nor breeze for mine eyes to cherish."
c222_Gacha_Get_1,"Beware, simply brandishing a blade does not make you its master."
c222_Reinforce_1,Surely iron cannot be forged without fire? Most peculiar indeed.
c222_Reinforce_2,Doth my blade spring from its sheathe with greater swiftness than before?
c222_Reinforce_3,"I feel more stout than before, to a degree akin to treachery!"
c222_Gift_1,"From you, my lord, such deportment is most unexpected."
c222_Gift_2,This... is truly an embarrassment of riches.
c222_Gift_3,"In the future, the two of us shall partake in the imbibing of spirits."
c222_Attractive_Up_1,"To wile away one's days on the surface, is this not something you have pondered?"
c222_Attractive_Up_2,"Latterly, I've been waiting to have a drink with you, my heart full of expectancy.
Such delight goes beyond my furthest imaginations."
c222_Attractive_Up_3,You manage to delight this soul of mine time and time again.
c222_Party_Deploy_1,Who shall be the next to fall under my blade?
c222_Field_Touch_1,Standing by.
c222_Field_Go_1,Here I go.
c222_Battle_Enter_1,"Rout them in their entirety, yes?"
c222_Battle_Ready_1,My blade shall not be made light of.
c222_Battle_Ready_2,Which of you scornful dunderheads dare step forward?
c222_Battle_Ready_3,"They are as candles, the better burnt out."
c222_Reload_1,The hour of retribution draws near.
c222_Reload_2,"You are out of harm's way, fleeting as it may be."
c222_Reload_3,You must persevere!
c222_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,The onus lies with me now.
c222_Ult_Skill_1,Behold my ultimate blade.
c222_FullBurst_1,Show them no quarter!
c222_Kill_Monster_1,'Tis but a lark.
c222_Kill_Monster_2,How's this?
c222_Kill_Monster_3,Bisect.
c222_Damage_1,Ow!
c222_Damage_2,Ugh!
c222_Damage_3,Ouch!
c222_Die_1,"I was careless. No, I require more practice."
c222_Win_1,Fancy a drink?
c230_Lobby_Touch_1,What are you looking at? Get back to work!
c230_Lobby_Touch_2,My crow only obeys my commands. Isn't she a good little birdie?
c230_Lobby_Touch_3,There is nothing on this planet more important than me. I can do as I please.
c230_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,You've brought life to this visage of mine. I'm quite pleased about that.
c230_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,That's the spirit! Keep it up and I'll dote on you even further!
c230_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,So you want to bring me to the Surface again?
c230_Lobby_Stay_1,Huh. It's so boring. Did you bring me up here just to ignore me?
c230_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Huh. I'm bored stiff. Do you want me to make you some witch soup?
c230_Outpost_Touch_1,Walking is such an inconvenience. Why don't you carry me instead?
c230_Outpost_Touch_2,This dump is a little better off now that I've arrived.
c230_Outpost_Touch_3,Wings of Victory? They suit me.
c230_Gacha_Get_1,You ought to thank your lucky stars that I'm around.
c230_Reinforce_1,"Yes, do my bidding, just like that."
c230_Reinforce_2,"Wow, I'm gaining strength!"
c230_Reinforce_3,Excellent. This will suffice for now.
c230_Gift_1,I accept your offering.
c230_Gift_2,I suppose this gift is satisfactory.
c230_Gift_3,Great. Please go on.
c230_Attractive_Up_1,Don't forget how kind I've been to you.
c230_Attractive_Up_2,"I'm more and more satisfied with you, Follower."
c230_Attractive_Up_3,I won't soon forget how you placed your faith in me.
c230_Party_Deploy_1,You need me?
c230_Field_Touch_1,Tell me about it.
c230_Field_Go_1,I made a special trip here just for you.
c230_Battle_Enter_1,Time to hunt.
c230_Battle_Ready_1,Time to kill.
c230_Battle_Ready_2,"Feeble-minded swine, this is the end of the line!"
c230_Battle_Ready_3,My crow thirsts for blood.
c230_Reload_1,You had it coming.
c230_Reload_2,Things are finally starting to get interesting.
c230_Reload_3,Reload!
c230_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's my turn.
c230_Ult_Skill_1,I hereby sentence you to death.
c230_FullBurst_1,I will burn you all to the ground!
c230_Kill_Monster_1,Hmph.
c230_Kill_Monster_2,I grow weary of these childish games.
c230_Kill_Monster_3,Are you dead yet?
c230_Damage_1,Urgh!
c230_Damage_2,Uh.
c230_Damage_3,Ugh.
c230_Die_1,"Foul creatures, I'll finish you off after I take a break."
c230_Win_1,Yet another victory I brought for you. No need to thank me.
c232_Lobby_Touch_1,"Good grief, I don't think I've even laid eyes upon such a weak Commander."
c232_Lobby_Touch_2,Hehe...
c232_Lobby_Touch_3,I'll never obey any command that comes from an impostor's mouth.
c232_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Ah~ I said I would protect you from now on!
c232_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Your weakness is simply one of your many charms.
This way, the only way I'll lose is if I let you win on purpose! Hehehe."
c232_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Imposter, very well, you may caress my hair.
Not everyone can earn this privilege."
c232_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hypocrite, whenever you stare off into space like that, your weakness is...too much to take. Blech..."
c232_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hey, why didn't you choose the Mightiest Shield on the Surface for the battle? You're not afraid of Raptures, are you?"
c232_Outpost_Touch_1,"It may have been built by a bunch of impostors, but the base is actually looking good. About as good as our outhouse, that is."
c232_Outpost_Touch_2,Hehehe...
c232_Outpost_Touch_3,"Kneel before me and lick my boots,
and perhaps I'll consider seeing you as my commander... for a day."
c232_Gacha_Get_1,"Get behind me, you weaklings."
c232_Reinforce_1,"Ha, I'm stronger!"
c232_Reinforce_2,"Heehee, you are falling further behind!"
c232_Reinforce_3,I can grow even stronger.
c232_Gift_1,Are you trying to bribe me with this?
c232_Gift_2,Ahem... I can see that you put some thought into this.
c232_Gift_3,Oh my gosh... For me?
c232_Attractive_Up_1,"I normally don't allow impostors to follow me, but I'll make an exception for you. Just keep it a secret, all right?"
c232_Attractive_Up_2,"I'll put this offering of yours to good use, hehe!"
c232_Attractive_Up_3,"Why are you so eager to have a closer relationship with me?
Well, either way, I won't say no to it."
c232_Party_Deploy_1,Need my help? Hehehe.
c232_Field_Touch_1,What's the scoop? Anything fun?
c232_Field_Go_1,What? I'm already on it.
c232_Battle_Enter_1,Let's get started!
c232_Battle_Ready_1,Time to crush those weaklings. Hehehe.
c232_Battle_Ready_2,Like shooting fish in a barrel.
c232_Battle_Ready_3,You can't even leave a scratch on my shield.
c232_Reload_1,This is taking forever.
c232_Reload_2,I'm cooling down.
c232_Reload_3,Those guys are dead meat.
c232_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Impostor, now!"
c232_Ult_Skill_1,I am invincible! Hehehe.
c232_FullBurst_1,"Girls, teach them a lesson!"
c232_Kill_Monster_1,Weaklings.
c232_Kill_Monster_2,So easy.
c232_Kill_Monster_3,Anyone?
c232_Damage_1,Argh!
c232_Damage_2,"Ah, don't!"
c232_Damage_3,Oops!
c232_Die_1,"No, impossible!"
c232_Win_1,If only a REAL commander could see this.
c111_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hehe! Hehehe! *Gasp, cough, cough*"
c111_Lobby_Touch_2,"The leader said I'm acting like a dog. That's a compliment, right?"
c111_Lobby_Touch_3,"I had a great day. I ate a lot, and got to fire a whole lotta artillery."
c111_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If anyone is giving you a hard time, let me know and I'll bite their heads off!"
c111_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Hehehe! It's always a blast hanging out with you, Commander."
c111_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I'll wait for you like a faithful guard dog. Aren't I awesome?
c111_Lobby_Stay_1,Commander... why aren't you doing anything? I'm bored stiff!
c111_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Come and play with me, Commander, or I'll give you a chomp. Hehe."
c111_Outpost_Touch_1,"Captain asked me to take you to Trandy Bar. No, was it Trendy Bar? Who cares. Let's go!"
c111_Outpost_Touch_2,"I've never been anywhere as great as this! Tasty food and fun abound!
Can I stay here as long as I like?"
c111_Outpost_Touch_3,What if I shoot here? Rat-tat-tat! HAHAHA!
c111_Gacha_Get_1,Hehehe! I'll rip out the throats of all your enemies!
c111_Reinforce_1,I'm so much stronger!
c111_Reinforce_2,Look! I've gotten my teeth sharpened!
c111_Reinforce_3,Whose throat will my fangs sink into?
c111_Gift_1,Is this for me? Really?
c111_Gift_2,"You are so nice, Commander!"
c111_Gift_3,All these are mine! Am I dreaming?
c111_Attractive_Up_1,"Commander, you're awesome!
But Crow is my owner. If she wasn't, I'd be by your side!"
c111_Attractive_Up_2,"Can we spend every day together?
I'd love that!"
c111_Attractive_Up_3,"Hehe! You're the only one I won't bite, that's the truth!"
c111_Party_Deploy_1,Are we going to play? Where at?
c111_Field_Touch_1,You rang?
c111_Field_Go_1,I'll be there ASAP!
c111_Battle_Enter_1,Pleasure incoming!
c111_Battle_Ready_1,I'm ready to bite down and never let go!
c111_Battle_Ready_2,Hehehe! Here it comes... Here it is!
c111_Battle_Ready_3,Compliment me when I take them down!
c111_Reload_1,Hehehe! I had a blast!
c111_Reload_2,"Gotta reload, and advance!"
c111_Reload_3,Yeeehawww! So exciting!
c111_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Commander!
c111_Ult_Skill_1,Tear them apart! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
c111_FullBurst_1,Hehehehe! Fire at will!
c111_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c111_Kill_Monster_2,Dead!
c111_Kill_Monster_3,Hehehehe!
c111_Damage_1,*Coughing*
c111_Damage_2,Owww!
c111_Damage_3,Ah!
c111_Die_1,"Arghhh... I've had enough, no more combat for now."
c111_Win_1,"I won, Commander! Gimme some treats!"
c040_Lobby_Touch_1,I'm not some homicidal maniac who kills indiscriminately.
c040_Lobby_Touch_2,Don't cross the law. I'd prefer not to kill you.
c040_Lobby_Touch_3,You want to know what's in my bag? Take a guess.
c040_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
c040_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You're a good person. Try and keep it that way.
c040_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Committing crime is unforgivable. Maybe it sounds cliché, but that's what I believe."
c040_Lobby_Stay_1,Patience is one of my strong suits.
c040_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Staying in can be enjoyable. Occasionally.
c040_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm at the hotel. Call me if you need anything.
c040_Outpost_Touch_2,Assassins always stay at hotels. Not exactly sure why.
c040_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place is occupied entirely by Nikkes, save you, so I doubt I'll be finding any of my targets here."
c040_Gacha_Get_1,"Do you wish to wear the crown?
Can you really bear its weight?"
c040_Reinforce_1,Your support is appreciated.
c040_Reinforce_2,Now I can get more work done.
c040_Reinforce_3,Enhancement complete.
c040_Gift_1,Is this payment for an assignment? I don't accept personal commissions.
c040_Gift_2,I'll put this to good use.
c040_Gift_3,As long as you don't have any ulterior motives... thanks.
c040_Attractive_Up_1,I knew you were a good person.
c040_Attractive_Up_2,"If everyone was like you, I wouldn't have to work so much."
c040_Attractive_Up_3,"You truly are unique,
in nearly every way possible."
c040_Party_Deploy_1,"Roger, I'm going with you."
c040_Field_Touch_1,Your orders?
c040_Field_Go_1,Moving out.
c040_Battle_Enter_1,Target in sight.
c040_Battle_Ready_1,"Target acquired, shoot to kill."
c040_Battle_Ready_2,Engaging the enemy.
c040_Battle_Ready_3,Hit 'em fast and hit 'em hard.
c040_Reload_1,Reloading.
c040_Reload_2,Target is still alive.
c040_Reload_3,This isn't easy.
c040_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready and waiting.
c040_Ult_Skill_1,Target sighted. Engaging.
c040_FullBurst_1,Finish it.
c040_Kill_Monster_1,Clear.
c040_Kill_Monster_2,Kill confirmed.
c040_Kill_Monster_3,Destroyed.
c040_Damage_1,Uh.
c040_Damage_2,Ow!
c040_Damage_3,*Cough*
c040_Die_1,Mission failed. We'll get 'em next time.
c040_Win_1,Mission complete.
c100_Lobby_Touch_1,Step aside and let the real heroine show you how it's done.
c100_Lobby_Touch_2,"Justice always prevails, and so do I!"
c100_Lobby_Touch_3,All Nikkes are heroic. It's in our nature.
c100_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Birdie! Let's be heroes together!
c100_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"As long as you trust me, I will never falter!"
c100_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"All Nikkes are heroes, and so are you!
So we will never lose!"
c100_Lobby_Stay_1,Awaiting your orders... for quite some time now!
c100_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Let's roll out, Birdie! 
There are people who need our help!"
c100_Outpost_Touch_1,"It's always deafeningly loud over at the power station, but you won't hear me complaining. All that commotion means Maxwell is busy crafting weapons!"
c100_Outpost_Touch_2,I'll ensure this place remains safe!
c100_Outpost_Touch_3,"Anyone need a hero? If so, I'm your gal!"
c100_Gacha_Get_1,"Don't freak out, but you've got the number one heroine with you now!"
c100_Reinforce_1,Oh! I'm feeling stronger now!
c100_Reinforce_2,"Not bad, you did good."
c100_Reinforce_3,"I know you've always got my back, Birdie!"
c100_Gift_1,You got this just for me? That's so nice of you!
c100_Gift_2,"Even though a true hero never expects anything in return, it's still a nice gesture."
c100_Gift_3,This is almost as fun as giving a bad guy what for!
c100_Attractive_Up_1,"All right Birdie, I'm going to grant you the honor of having you accompany me on my heroic journey!"
c100_Attractive_Up_2,It's so strange... Being with you somehow makes me feel more heroic!
c100_Attractive_Up_3,"Birdie, thank you for everything you've done for me!
Now it's my turn to take care of you."
c100_Party_Deploy_1,Here I come!
c100_Field_Touch_1,Point me to the bad guys!
c100_Field_Go_1,I'm raring to go!
c100_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter imminent! Get ready!
c100_Battle_Ready_1,"Don't you worry, I'll squash them all like bugs."
c100_Battle_Ready_2,Those who block the path of the righteous will be shown no quarter!
c100_Battle_Ready_3,I am an agent of justice.
c100_Reload_1,Reloading!
c100_Reload_2,You're tougher than I thought.
c100_Reload_3,Even a hero needs to recharge once in a while!
c100_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Birdie!
c100_Ult_Skill_1,"C'mon everyone, let's score one for the good guys!"
c100_FullBurst_1,Give 'em everything you've got!
c100_Kill_Monster_1,"You can run, but you can't hide!"
c100_Kill_Monster_2,Justice has been served.
c100_Kill_Monster_3,Who's next?
c100_Damage_1,Uh.
c100_Damage_2,Ugh.
c100_Damage_3,Ow!
c100_Die_1,*Cough*Is this the end? Am I too weak?!
c100_Win_1,I told you justice would prevail!
c282_Lobby_Touch_1,"At the end of the day, organizations are made up of humans, who should be treated with dignity."
c282_Lobby_Touch_2,What do you want from me this time?
c282_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you want the support of the organization, you'll need to win me over first."
c282_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"All that is yours, is mine. Never forget that."
c282_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You're free to have tea with me anytime...
c282_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Would you like to go see the cherry blossoms in the garden?
c282_Lobby_Stay_1,"Since you're leaving me here standing, I assume you're taking time to compose a haiku?"
c282_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,It's nice spending a quiet moment with you.
c282_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm expanding my knowledge and looking into the organization you're a part of.
c282_Outpost_Touch_2,It's nice to get out sometimes.
c282_Outpost_Touch_3,"Apparently there is a court here, but in name only. Any semblance of justice in this place rests in your own hands."
c282_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Sakura, head of Saimaikai. If you are willing to accept the assistance of the underworld, I will gladly give it."
c282_Reinforce_1,I will remember this.
c282_Reinforce_2,Are you starting to trust me?
c282_Reinforce_3,It won't do us any harm to be overprepared.
c282_Gift_1,"Why would you give this to me? On second thought, I'll accept it gladly."
c282_Gift_2,"You're not doing this just to get into my good books, are you?"
c282_Gift_3,You truly are a kind person.
c282_Attractive_Up_1,I hope that I'm the only recipient of your love.
c282_Attractive_Up_2,You always catch me off guard like this.
c282_Attractive_Up_3,"Since our bond has deepened, perhaps the flavor of our tea will follow likewise."
c282_Party_Deploy_1,"Very well, I will lend you the organization's power."
c282_Field_Touch_1,I'm here.
c282_Field_Go_1,On my way.
c282_Battle_Enter_1,Time to take out the trash.
c282_Battle_Ready_1,I'll settle this according to our own rules.
c282_Battle_Ready_2,Those without sense of duty are punished.
c282_Battle_Ready_3,"By Saimaikai, these fiends will go no further."
c282_Reload_1,Can you buy me some time?
c282_Reload_2,Trust me.
c282_Reload_3,No time to waste.
c282_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"You and me, right now."
c282_Ult_Skill_1,We are Saimaikai. We see all.
c282_FullBurst_1,The time has come to end this strife.
c282_Kill_Monster_1,Easy.
c282_Kill_Monster_2,Next.
c282_Kill_Monster_3,We're on a roll. Let's keep going.
c282_Damage_1,Ah!
c282_Damage_2,Too many.
c282_Damage_3,Uh.
c282_Die_1,I'm sorry I didn't see this through.
c282_Win_1,The organization will be proud of this outcome.
c112_Lobby_Touch_1,You want to know what I'm thinking? Do you want to see for yourself?
c112_Lobby_Touch_2,Let me show you something fun.
c112_Lobby_Touch_3,"Honey, can you use this to send a message for me?"
c112_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I canceled all my plans to hang out with you. Wanna take a look?
c112_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,For your eyes only. It's my deepest secret. ♡
c112_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I've saved every single message you sent me. See?
c112_Lobby_Stay_1,"What are you up to, honey? I'm so bored... You're not going to leave me like this, are you?"
c112_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I was a little upset that you were ignoring me, but now that you're actually here, I can't stay mad at you!"
c112_Outpost_Touch_1,"Whoa, the Outer Rim is a dump compared to here.
If this area is under my control..."
c112_Outpost_Touch_2,"Captain told me to bring you to Trendy Bar by any means necessary.
How about through seduction?"
c112_Outpost_Touch_3,"You are the owner of the Outpost, right?
This land will be in my possession if you belong to me."
c112_Gacha_Get_1,"Am I an eye-catching python, or a viper that can kill? That depends on you."
c112_Reinforce_1,You want me to get stronger? Why?
c112_Reinforce_2,"That's just fine, thanks."
c112_Reinforce_3,It's all on you if I end up spoiled.
c112_Gift_1,These are for me? That's so sweet!
c112_Gift_2,Gifts always delight.
c112_Gift_3,"That's nice of you, Honey♡"
c112_Attractive_Up_1,"Don't let your guard down, Honey.
Nourishing a viper in your bosom is not a wise choice."
c112_Attractive_Up_2,Do you mind going further with me?
c112_Attractive_Up_3,"I planned to make you fall head over heels for me, but it appears the opposite has happened."
c112_Party_Deploy_1,You really want to have me by your side?
c112_Field_Touch_1,Hmm... Honey.
c112_Field_Go_1,I'd rather not walk.
c112_Battle_Enter_1,"Wow, that thing's quite terrifying."
c112_Battle_Ready_1,"I'm trembling! Go to hell, scary monsters!"
c112_Battle_Ready_2,Hmmm... Too much shooting will make my arms sore.
c112_Battle_Ready_3,Kill the goons over here!
c112_Reload_1,Reloading♡
c112_Reload_2,"Hey, calm down."
c112_Reload_3,No! My nail broke!
c112_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Honey ♪
c112_Ult_Skill_1,"Sending my love, ready for it?"
c112_FullBurst_1,Fire to the front!
c112_Kill_Monster_1,One down♡
c112_Kill_Monster_2,Going down!
c112_Kill_Monster_3,Oh yay!
c112_Damage_1,Annoying.
c112_Damage_2,Ow!
c112_Damage_3,Uh.
c112_Die_1,"Sorry, Honey... I ran out of steam. Gonna take a break."
c112_Win_1,See? I made it! No enemies left standing.
c280_Lobby_Touch_1,"If words fail, then your only recourse is physical force. That's the kind of world I operate in."
c280_Lobby_Touch_2,This is what happens to those who betray me.
c280_Lobby_Touch_3,Only those with a strong will are capable of overseeing this organization.
c280_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Come here, Mister.
If you want to stay alive, stick close to me."
c280_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Perhaps tonight, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."
c280_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"No one can touch you, except me."
c280_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hey, if you called me out here for nothing, the least you could do is dance for me."
c280_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You're staring at me so intently. Don't think I don't know why. Well, what are you waiting for? Do you want me to make the first move?"
c280_Outpost_Touch_1,"I'll never see the inside of a courtroom.
My enforcers would take everyone out before anything went to trial."
c280_Outpost_Touch_2,"So, all of these Nikkes are your family? Does that, perhaps... include me?"
c280_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place has a fairly thriving business district. If you want, I can offer to protect some of the establishments. How about it?"
c280_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Rosanna, the leader of Hedonia. 
There is nothing to be afraid of, so long as you are not my enemy."
c280_Reinforce_1,Hahaha. Now I can kill more easily.
c280_Reinforce_2,Hmm... I assume you want me to use this power to protect you?
c280_Reinforce_3,Now I'll be able to boost my power.
c280_Gift_1,It's always wise to accept a gift from someone so good-looking.
c280_Gift_2,"I presume in exchange for this, you want personal protection? Very well."
c280_Gift_3,"You're not leading me on, are you?"
c280_Attractive_Up_1,"Do you have your sights set on becoming more ""intimately"" connected with my business?"
c280_Attractive_Up_2,"You're coming awfully close. Well, what's your next move?"
c280_Attractive_Up_3,"From now on, any enemy of yours is an enemy of Hedonia."
c280_Party_Deploy_1,It's only natural that you would need my help in times like this.
c280_Field_Touch_1,What do you need me to do?
c280_Field_Go_1,I'm coming. Don't rush me.
c280_Battle_Enter_1,Time to do what I do best.
c280_Battle_Ready_1,"Don't forget, everyone, this is war."
c280_Battle_Ready_2,"If I die, I'm taking you all with me."
c280_Battle_Ready_3,Wipe them all out. Show them no mercy.
c280_Reload_1,"Now then, who's next?"
c280_Reload_2,This is child's play.
c280_Reload_3,"Don't worry, everyone will get their turn to die."
c280_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Let's go, guys."
c280_Ult_Skill_1,Let's have some fun!
c280_FullBurst_1,Let's see who racks up more kills!
c280_Kill_Monster_1,Is that all you've got?
c280_Kill_Monster_2,Bullseye.
c280_Kill_Monster_3,Easy.
c280_Damage_1,Ha.
c280_Damage_2,How dare you?
c280_Damage_3,Ah.
c280_Die_1,Are you sure you can... take it from here?
c280_Win_1,That's why you don't want to get on my bad side.
c260_Lobby_Touch_1,"I'll protect you, Commander!"
c260_Lobby_Touch_2,"Commander, Rapi, Anis, Neon... You're all the best!"
c260_Lobby_Touch_3,I think bandages are great. They make me feel warm inside.
c260_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I like you Commander, way more than Rapi, Anis, or Neon!"
c260_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"The bandages you gave me are my most treasured possession.
I won't share them with anyone."
c260_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'm so elated Commander, just over the moon!"
c260_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander, are we playing Red Light, Green Light?"
c260_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hehe, I like staying still like this 'cause then I can watch you all the time!"
c260_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place makes me feel warm inside. Just like with you, Commander."
c260_Outpost_Touch_2,Anis kicked me out of the dormitory because I sprinkled flour everywhere.
c260_Outpost_Touch_3,"Commander! Let's go for a wao... wall... What's the word? Ah, that's it! Let's go for a waook!"
c260_Gacha_Get_1,"I said I would protect you Commander, and I will."
c260_Reinforce_1,It's amazing!
c260_Reinforce_2,I've become stronger!
c260_Reinforce_3,I will continue to protect you.
c260_Gift_1,"This is kind of like a bandage, right?"
c260_Gift_2,"You're the best, Commander!"
c260_Gift_3,"Every time I get one of your gifts, my heart flutters."
c260_Attractive_Up_1,"Commander, I miss you so much. I miss you every single day."
c260_Attractive_Up_2,"Whenever I'm around you, I feel warm inside."
c260_Attractive_Up_3,"I like you, Commander. I really do."
c260_Party_Deploy_1,"I will always protect you, Commander!"
c260_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Commander!"
c260_Field_Go_1,Want me to go there?
c260_Battle_Enter_1,Encoming Incounter... Is that right?
c260_Battle_Ready_1,I've got your back!
c260_Battle_Ready_2,Can I attack now?
c260_Battle_Ready_3,Are you in danger? Let me at 'em!
c260_Reload_1,Re...loa...ding!
c260_Reload_2,I'll reload right now.
c260_Reload_3,Uh... Rapi told me so...
c260_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Ready or not, here I come!"
c260_Ult_Skill_1,You're mine!
c260_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, give 'em everything you've got!"
c260_Kill_Monster_1,... Poor thing.
c260_Kill_Monster_2,Huh? They're all down.
c260_Kill_Monster_3,Did I do well?
c260_Damage_1,Ow!
c260_Damage_2,Argh!
c260_Damage_3,Ow!
c260_Die_1,Commander... I'm so sorry...
c260_Win_1,Chalk up another victory for the Commander!
c311_Lobby_Touch_1,Everything's better with fresh ketchup. The more the better.
c311_Lobby_Touch_2,"What would you like me to draw for you, Master?"
c311_Lobby_Touch_3,"With this, we can fix just about anything."
c311_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Will you be having the usual?
c311_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Manners make the maid.
c311_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Let's have some fun when Ade isn't looking!
c311_Lobby_Stay_1,"What are you up to, Master? We can hang out if you don't have anyone to spend time with."
c311_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"If you have nothing to do right now, how about we go on an adventure together? Let's find somewhere where we can really make some paper planes fly."
c311_Outpost_Touch_1,"A real maid can fold 50 napkins at a time. If you're incapable of that, then you can't call yourself a professional."
c311_Outpost_Touch_2,"At the Maid Cafe, we draw all sorts of fun things on omelet rice and hold napkin-folding competitions. You should come visit sometime."
c311_Outpost_Touch_3,"This here is Cocorella. She does all sorts of things, but she mainly functions as an umbrella. She's got a bit of a temper, so you gotta treat her with respect."
c311_Gacha_Get_1,"Cocoa, the Maid Leader, at your service."
c311_Reinforce_1,The path to becoming a professional maid is long and trying.
c311_Reinforce_2,"Master, did you see that? I'm getting stronger!"
c311_Reinforce_3,I wonder how powerful Cocorella plans on becoming...
c311_Gift_1,Wow...
c311_Gift_2,Soda will be jealous if she sees this. I'll give it to Cocorella for safekeeping.
c311_Gift_3,Wow... How did you know I like this?
c311_Attractive_Up_1,"You can always find me at the cafe, Master."
c311_Attractive_Up_2,I can't remember the last time I had so much fun with someone.
c311_Attractive_Up_3,"Master, I like you just as much as Ade and Soda."
c311_Party_Deploy_1,Someone call for a maid?
c311_Field_Touch_1,"I'm back, Master... Oh wait, not this one."
c311_Field_Go_1,Yes sir.
c311_Battle_Enter_1,"Cocoa, peacekeeper of the world."
c311_Battle_Ready_1,"Cocorella, activate combat mode."
c311_Battle_Ready_2,A professional maid always protects her master.
c311_Battle_Ready_3,Time to teach them some manners.
c311_Reload_1,Fast reload.
c311_Reload_2,Whew... humph!
c311_Reload_3,"Let's go, Cocorella."
c311_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,The time is now!
c311_Ult_Skill_1,A maid always knows how to wrap things up.
c311_FullBurst_1,"Attention, customers! The time is now!"
c311_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c311_Kill_Monster_2,Hohoho!
c311_Kill_Monster_3,Perfect.
c311_Damage_1,Jeez!
c311_Damage_2,Uh.
c311_Damage_3,Ow!
c311_Die_1,"I failed to protect you, Master..."
c311_Win_1,"For a professional maid, this is a piece of pudding."
c312_Lobby_Touch_1,"You're back, Master!"
c312_Lobby_Touch_2,Everyone is happy when things are spick and span.
c312_Lobby_Touch_3,"Of all the household chores, I'm best at cleaning!"
c312_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Maid for you♪ Maid for you♪ Meet the maid especially for you♪ What do you think? Did that put you in a better mood?
c312_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"No matter how much I scrub them, these pesky spots are still on the window..."
c312_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Here, put your head on my lap so I can clean your ears... Oh, wait... then I won't be able to see your cute little face!"
c312_Lobby_Stay_1,I should tidy the place up while Master is asleep!
c312_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hehe, sleeping again... let's see if this will wake Master up..."
c312_Outpost_Touch_1,I found a place to clean!
c312_Outpost_Touch_2,"Master, do you want to stop by the Maid Cafe? I can give you a massage."
c312_Outpost_Touch_3,I like this place! Everyone looks so happy here.
c312_Gacha_Get_1,I just want everyone to be happy.
c312_Reinforce_1,I feel so refreshed!
c312_Reinforce_2,Cleaner and cleaner!
c312_Reinforce_3,Does this mean I won't get into as many accidents?
c312_Gift_1,Huh...? Are you giving it to me? Wow!
c312_Gift_2,"I want to do something in return, but I'm not sure what you like."
c312_Gift_3,"I feel like you always give me gifts, but I never return the favor. Are you sure that's okay?"
c312_Attractive_Up_1,All I want is for Master to be as happy as I am!
c312_Attractive_Up_2,"I like you so, so much, Master!"
c312_Attractive_Up_3,"I want to be your personal maid, Master!"
c312_Party_Deploy_1,Cleaning preparations all finished.
c312_Field_Touch_1,Got it.
c312_Field_Go_1,I'll be going.
c312_Battle_Enter_1,Cleaning starts now!
c312_Battle_Ready_1,"Everyone, hang in there!"
c312_Battle_Ready_2,Just look at this mess! Better start cleaning.
c312_Battle_Ready_3,No mistakes this time!
c312_Reload_1,Heave-ho!
c312_Reload_2,Is this thing working?
c312_Reload_3,I mustn't break it...
c312_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Huh? I-I think it's ready!
c312_Ult_Skill_1,I want this place... immaculate!
c312_FullBurst_1,"Nothing like a good cleaning, am I right?"
c312_Kill_Monster_1,Stop making such a mess!
c312_Kill_Monster_2,"There we go, sparkling clean!"
c312_Kill_Monster_3,Argh!
c312_Damage_1,Ow...
c312_Damage_2,Gasp.
c312_Damage_3,Yikes!
c312_Die_1,Oweee... Master...
c312_Win_1,"Wowee, we did it!"
c381_Lobby_Touch_1,All the dogs gather together when I blow this whistle! Wanna see?
c381_Lobby_Touch_2,Doodoodoo... what should I do with the dogs today?
c381_Lobby_Touch_3,"La-dee-dah~♬... Oh, hey Trainer."
c381_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Erm, Trainer? Is there any chance you could... pet me on the head?"
c381_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Wow! You came bounding over when I blew this whistle! That's awesome!
c381_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Dogs are cute, but so are you, hee hee."
c381_Lobby_Stay_1,Is there a chance I can go play with the dogs?
c381_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Trainer, hurry up and get over here! Let's go play with the dogs."
c381_Outpost_Touch_1,Wanna take a walk with me?
c381_Outpost_Touch_2,Wanna play catch with me? We can play using a ball or frisbee!
c381_Outpost_Touch_3,Where are you going? I wanna come too!
c381_Gacha_Get_1,I'm the dog whisperer! Hee hee!
c381_Reinforce_1,"Wow, feels like I just ate a big bowl of kibble!"
c381_Reinforce_2,Omnomnom~♬ Omnomnom~♬
c381_Reinforce_3,My bark is just as bad as my bite!
c381_Gift_1,Wow... this is the first time I've ever gotten a gift like this.
c381_Gift_2,This is awesome! I'll bring it with me every day when I go for my walks.
c381_Gift_3,"*Gasp* Are you sure I can keep this? Thank you, Trainer!"
c381_Attractive_Up_1,"Dogs are great, but you're pretty cool too, Trainer."
c381_Attractive_Up_2,I hope you'll join me on my walks soon. Hee hee!
c381_Attractive_Up_3,It's like my feelings for you... have become thiiiissssss big.
c381_Party_Deploy_1,Are we going for a walk?
c381_Field_Touch_1,Woof woof!
c381_Field_Go_1,Moving out!
c381_Battle_Enter_1,Re-ready!
c381_Battle_Ready_1,"I'll protect you, Trainer!"
c381_Battle_Ready_2,"I'm a little scared, but I can do it!"
c381_Battle_Ready_3,Every dog has its day!
c381_Reload_1,Things are going ruff...
c381_Reload_2,Stop hounding me!
c381_Reload_3,*Gulp* Reloading!
c381_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Trainer!
c381_Ult_Skill_1,You are all barking up the wrong tree!
c381_FullBurst_1,The leash is coming off!
c381_Kill_Monster_1,Wow!
c381_Kill_Monster_2,Did I do well?
c381_Kill_Monster_3,Hehe! I caught it!
c381_Damage_1,Ow...
c381_Damage_2,Argh!
c381_Damage_3,Ugh!
c381_Die_1,Trainer... I just need to rest for a while...
c381_Win_1,"I won, hee hee! Do I get a treat for that?"
c400_Lobby_Touch_1,This thing is so stifling... Any chance I can have this untied?
c400_Lobby_Touch_2,Didn't you say you trusted me? So why won't you untie me?
c400_Lobby_Touch_3,"How long do I have to stay like this, Counselor?"
c400_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Haven't I been doing well in my rehabilitation, Counselor? Why don't you untie me just this once?"
c400_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Do you like what you see, Counselor?"
c400_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Just because I'm in these restraints, you think you can touch me however you want??"
c400_Lobby_Stay_1,"Ugh, so bored... I should just end my life and be done with it."
c400_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Why don't you come closer? I want to hold your hand, Counselor..."
c400_Outpost_Touch_1,It really is nice here... It's not nearly as stuffy as the Rehabilitation Center...
c400_Outpost_Touch_2,"This is the Courthouse, isn't it? You're not trying to have me punished again, right?"
c400_Outpost_Touch_3,"When I was at the Courthouse, I encountered some patients I've seen at the Rehabilitation Center. Are you sure it's a good idea to gather so many of us under one roof?"
c400_Gacha_Get_1,"Since you rehabilitated me,
I don't want you straying too far. All right?"
c400_Reinforce_1,"Wow, I've gotten stronger!"
c400_Reinforce_2,This'll make me a force to be reckoned with. Are you sure this is all right?
c400_Reinforce_3,Just once... I'd love to use my powers to my heart's content.
c400_Gift_1,A gift? Why are you giving me this? You want me to like you?
c400_Gift_2,So this is the kind of stuff you get when you're rehabilitated? That's simply amazing!
c400_Gift_3,"I don't need any of these things. To be able to hold your hand is the greatest gift of all, but still, thanks..."
c400_Attractive_Up_1,"The odd thing is I want you more and more, Counselor..."
c400_Attractive_Up_2,"Don't be afraid of me, Counselor... Please learn to trust me..."
c400_Attractive_Up_3,"Being rehabilitated sure has its perks,
like say... being with you, Counselor."
c400_Party_Deploy_1,"Counselor, you need me...?"
c400_Field_Touch_1,Hm... What should I do now?
c400_Field_Go_1,Do I really need to go all the way over there?
c400_Battle_Enter_1,Time to cut loose.
c400_Battle_Ready_1,It's nice being able to move my arms.
c400_Battle_Ready_2,My hands are free... I wanna break something!
c400_Battle_Ready_3,"You released me, I'll do as you say, Counselor."
c400_Reload_1,Gotta be prepared...
c400_Reload_2,Guns are boring... I like using my fists...
c400_Reload_3,"You gotta be careful, else the gun will break..."
c400_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Counselor...
c400_Ult_Skill_1,"No restraints, no mercy!"
c400_FullBurst_1,Don't run away! Let's play together!
c400_Kill_Monster_1,One down.
c400_Kill_Monster_2,Who's next?
c400_Kill_Monster_3,So happy!
c400_Damage_1,Ugh...
c400_Damage_2,That hurts...
c400_Damage_3,Ow!
c400_Die_1,So tired... I'm tapping out.
c400_Win_1,"This is what you wanted, right? Did I do well?"
c261_Lobby_Touch_1,There's nothing I despise more than boredom.
c261_Lobby_Touch_2,"Keep pestering me, and see what happens."
c261_Lobby_Touch_3,"So boooooring! If you don't get a move on, you'll be sorry."
c261_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you bug me, I'll return it two-fold."
c261_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Don't be scared. I don't feel like meddling in your affairs right now.
c261_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'm jonesing for a fix right now, and I gotta break something. Wanna join me?"
c261_Lobby_Stay_1,Don't just stand there and stare at me. Move.
c261_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Okay, soak it all in while you can. This is the only chance you're going to get."
c261_Outpost_Touch_1,Hm... This place ain't so bad. Plenty of things to break.
c261_Outpost_Touch_2,"Everything here reeks of your scent, Human. I'm itching to tear it all to shreds."
c261_Outpost_Touch_3,I can't believe you brought me to such a peaceful place... You all right?
c261_Gacha_Get_1,"You've got your work cut out for you, Human. I'm gonna destroy everything."
c261_Reinforce_1,"Ugh, I wanna go bust something up."
c261_Reinforce_2,You're not too bad yourself.
c261_Reinforce_3,"Good job, Human."
c261_Gift_1,"Trying to ply me with gifts, are you? Well, do keep trying."
c261_Gift_2,The best present would be having you on a silver platter... but I should probably stop now.
c261_Gift_3,You really do know what I like.
c261_Attractive_Up_1,Hmm... You're kind of fun.
c261_Attractive_Up_2,"Humans are usually such monotonous creatures. Yet, you're not the same."
c261_Attractive_Up_3,I'd love to swallow you up just once... I guess now's not the time?
c261_Party_Deploy_1,You think you can handle me?
c261_Field_Touch_1,What?
c261_Field_Go_1,Is that place a little more exciting?
c261_Battle_Enter_1,Are things finally going to pick up?
c261_Battle_Ready_1,I can use a little excitement right now.
c261_Battle_Ready_2,"You can run, but you can't hide!"
c261_Battle_Ready_3,Haha! Time to play.
c261_Reload_1,Let's keep it going.
c261_Reload_2,Now it's starting to get fun!
c261_Reload_3,"More, more, more! Let's fight!"
c261_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Let's go wild!
c261_Ult_Skill_1,It's my turn! Taste this!
c261_FullBurst_1,Kill them all! Mwahahaha!
c261_Kill_Monster_1,Next!
c261_Kill_Monster_2,"C'mon, next! Hurry up!"
c261_Kill_Monster_3,Gotcha.
c261_Damage_1,Hm?
c261_Damage_2,Oh yeah?
c261_Damage_3,Haha!
c261_Die_1,This is boring. I'm done here.
c261_Win_1,"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
c401_Lobby_Touch_1,"Ugh, this converter feels so constricting around my neck. I'm sure even you think so too."
c401_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hey, you want some Splendamin? The pack is brand new!"
c401_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm a model prisoner, honest."
c401_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You're a paragon of virtue, Instructor."
c401_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Can't you take this off, even for just a moment? We can keep it between us."
c401_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Let's give you some more points, Instructor. Any good ideas?"
c401_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'm so bored... Let's chat, Instructor!"
c401_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Oh, you're abandoning me now that I've been rehabilitated?
You should know better than that, Instructor. 10 points deducted!"
c401_Outpost_Touch_1,"The facilities here are really good, and there're loads of people to talk to as well."
c401_Outpost_Touch_2,"How am I doing? Don't worry, everyone here has been nice so far."
c401_Outpost_Touch_3,"A Courthouse? That's fab, everything should be done according to the letter of the law."
c401_Gacha_Get_1,"I've finally been rehabilitated! To celebrate, here's 10 points!"
c401_Reinforce_1,Thaannnkksss!
c401_Reinforce_2,"At this rate, I'll be the strongest one here at the Outpost."
c401_Reinforce_3,"Hahaha! That's it! More, more!"
c401_Gift_1,You don't have to give me this...
c401_Gift_2,"A token of your appreciation?
I'm so touched... 30 points for you!"
c401_Gift_3,"Thanks, I'm grateful and all, but... material things aren't everything."
c401_Attractive_Up_1,Now we're talking!
c401_Attractive_Up_2,"I've never met anyone like you before, Instructor."
c401_Attractive_Up_3,"You've been taking great care of me lately, Instructor. It's incredibly laudable, so here's 30 points for you!"
c401_Party_Deploy_1,Time for some community service...
c401_Field_Touch_1,Where should I work at?
c401_Field_Go_1,"Hopefully, I hit pay dirt."
c401_Battle_Enter_1,"Let's go earn some points, kids!"
c401_Battle_Ready_1,"Imagine... me, contributing to society."
c401_Battle_Ready_2,Can we be real for a sec?
c401_Battle_Ready_3,"Jeez, these guys are even worse than me!"
c401_Reload_1,Reloading!
c401_Reload_2,Argh!
c401_Reload_3,What should I have for dinner tonight?
c401_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Can I take it off now, Instructor?"
c401_Ult_Skill_1,I have something to say. Wanna hear it?
c401_FullBurst_1,Ready? Let's serve up some street justice.
c401_Kill_Monster_1,Hahaha!
c401_Kill_Monster_2,Bang! Bang!
c401_Kill_Monster_3,Let's get to work.
c401_Damage_1,Ugh...
c401_Damage_2,That hurts!
c401_Damage_3,Yeouch!
c401_Die_1,Sigh... they were too much for me...
c401_Win_1,See that? There's nothing you can't solve with words.
c233_Lobby_Touch_1,"I will guide you to paradise, Your Grace."
c233_Lobby_Touch_2,Those deserving the blessing of paradise shall have it.
c233_Lobby_Touch_3,This is Eden's armor. Do you like it?
c233_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"So long as we share a common goal, we can be together moving forward."
c233_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I will have plenty of use for you in the future, Your Grace."
c233_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Don't you look forward to life in paradise?
c233_Lobby_Stay_1,"Why aren't you saying anything? You aren't leaving me here while you do something else, are you?"
c233_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Go ahead if you have a mission to complete. I'll keep watch over you here.
c233_Outpost_Touch_1,Neither the Ark nor Eden... interesting. This place reminds me of you.
c233_Outpost_Touch_2,Is this place your own paradise? Intriguing.
c233_Outpost_Touch_3,Wings of Victory? Pfft. A group of weaklings converging to make something as useless as themselves.
c233_Gacha_Get_1,"You called me? My name is Dorothy, and I guide others to paradise, Your Grace."
c233_Reinforce_1,"To thank you, I will give you results."
c233_Reinforce_2,Thank you for this.
c233_Reinforce_3,"I'm quite capable of leveling up in the Ark as well, I see."
c233_Gift_1,Is this how you take care of Nikkes?
c233_Gift_2,Are you trying to get my attention?
c233_Gift_3,Your efforts will not go unnoticed.
c233_Attractive_Up_1,"Recently, my mind has been filled with you."
c233_Attractive_Up_2,"Fine, you have piqued my interest. Satisfied?"
c233_Attractive_Up_3,"Shall I use you, or make you mine... I'm not so sure what I'll do."
c233_Party_Deploy_1,"If you want, I will join you, Your Grace."
c233_Field_Touch_1,Did you find it?
c233_Field_Go_1,"Very well, moving out."
c233_Battle_Enter_1,Coming.
c233_Battle_Ready_1,I'm here. There's no cause for concern.
c233_Battle_Ready_2,I will show you what Eden is capable of.
c233_Battle_Ready_3,This will be finished soon. You can rest for a moment.
c233_Reload_1,Reloading.
c233_Reload_2,This may take more time than I thought.
c233_Reload_3,You are merely delaying the inevitable.
c233_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,My turn.
c233_Ult_Skill_1,Everything superfluous will be banished from paradise.
c233_FullBurst_1,Time to finish this.
c233_Kill_Monster_1,I wanted a challenge.
c233_Kill_Monster_2,Who's next?
c233_Kill_Monster_3,Hmm... Let's see.
c233_Damage_1,Very good.
c233_Damage_2,Haha.
c233_Damage_3,Damn you...
c233_Die_1,My apologies. I no longer wish to expend any energy here.
c233_Win_1,"I shall grant you victory, Your Grace."
c132_Lobby_Touch_1,"If it's too hot, be sure to tell me.
Summertime is when you're most at risk for heat stroke."
c132_Lobby_Touch_2,I get to see the ocean thanks to you.
c132_Lobby_Touch_3,This is so relaxing!
c132_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Since you barely have any clothes on, it'll make giving a physical exam much simpler, haha!"
c132_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'll rub some sunscreen on you later.
Otherwise, you'll get burned if you stay out in the sun."
c132_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"The sun's shining awfully bright today. Actually, it reminds me of you, Commander."
c132_Lobby_Stay_1,"You haven't swam in the ocean yet, have you?
I can't swim, so I won't be able to save you if you fall in."
c132_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"There's nothing wrong with playing in the water, but just be careful so you don't end up drowning.
If anything happened to you, I'd never be able to forgive myself."
c132_Outpost_Touch_1,That day was so much fun!
c132_Outpost_Touch_2,"Maybe the next time, we can go, just the two of us.
I can be your personal attending physician, hehe."
c132_Outpost_Touch_3,I look forward to our next vacation.
c132_Gacha_Get_1,"Playing in the water is fun and all, but be careful not to tire yourself out."
c132_Reinforce_1,"I'll be able to give you a more thorough examination next time, hehe!"
c132_Reinforce_2,Now my physical fortitude is as strong as my mental fortitude!
c132_Reinforce_3,"You've got to catch up, Commander.
I'm the only one getting stronger."
c132_Gift_1,"Oh, thank you! This may come in handy during your next physical."
c132_Gift_2,"You're so kind, Commander."
c132_Gift_3,I'll take good care of this.
c132_Attractive_Up_1,It seems kind of hot in here... maybe that's just because it's summer?
c132_Attractive_Up_2,"In theory, I should treat every patient the exact same, but I do show you some special treatment from time to time."
c132_Attractive_Up_3,"I'm a bit concerned, because I can't stop thinking about you."
c132_Party_Deploy_1,Do you need help?
c132_Field_Touch_1,Yes? What is it?
c132_Field_Go_1,Coming!
c132_Battle_Enter_1,"Oh dear, there isn't much time to rest, is there?"
c132_Battle_Ready_1,"Everyone, gather 'round."
c132_Battle_Ready_2,I've got a special inoculation prepared for this.
c132_Battle_Ready_3,This'll only hurt a bit.
c132_Reload_1,"Wait a moment, please."
c132_Reload_2,I'll be back in a jiffy.
c132_Reload_3,Reloading.
c132_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Commander?
c132_Ult_Skill_1,Just a little closer...
c132_FullBurst_1,"Pain, be gone!"
c132_Kill_Monster_1,Next patient.
c132_Kill_Monster_2,Haha!
c132_Kill_Monster_3,Invasive pathogens exterminated.
c132_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c132_Damage_2,Errggh!
c132_Damage_3,*Gasp*
c132_Die_1,"Sorry, but I'll have to bow out early."
c132_Win_1,"If you're hurt anywhere, come find me."
c352_Lobby_Touch_1,"We'll take to the high seas, I'm sure of it!"
c352_Lobby_Touch_2,The Admire is invincible. I just have to prove it.
c352_Lobby_Touch_3,"This is just a prop sword, so don't be scared."
c352_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,You need to take better care of yourself.
c352_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Will you join us at the next fundraiser?
c352_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"When we finally take to the high seas, I hope you'll be there with me."
c352_Lobby_Stay_1,"What are you doing? If you have nothing better to do, I'm leaving."
c352_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You zoned out for a while back there. Are you all right? If you're feeling under the weather, just let me know."
c352_Outpost_Touch_1,The observatory... I'm sure Anchor will love it here.
c352_Outpost_Touch_2,This place is so well-maintained. I wonder where they're getting their money from?
c352_Outpost_Touch_3,"It's been ages since I went for a swim... O-oh, never mind..."
c352_Gacha_Get_1,I look forward to the day I go on a voyage with you.
c352_Reinforce_1,Another step closer to my dream.
c352_Reinforce_2,"If I convert this to credits... O-oh, never mind... Thanks."
c352_Reinforce_3,I will never let you down.
c352_Gift_1,"You can put donations over there. Wait, it's a gift? Oh... um... S-sorry."
c352_Gift_2,"You shouldn't spend so much on me... but thanks, anyways."
c352_Gift_3,"Thanks, but I feel bad accepting it."
c352_Attractive_Up_1,"I'm sorry, but I'm not blushing right now, am I?"
c352_Attractive_Up_2,Can I ask you a question? Do you... um... get around a lot?
c352_Attractive_Up_3,These feelings weren't mentioned in the textbook...
c352_Party_Deploy_1,"Finally, it's time we can show everyone what we're capable of!"
c352_Field_Touch_1,Please make your orders clear and concise.
c352_Field_Go_1,"All right, moving in."
c352_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging with the enemy.
c352_Battle_Ready_1,If we can't clinch the victory...
c352_Battle_Ready_2,You can always count on quality training.
c352_Battle_Ready_3,Time to show them what we're made of.
c352_Reload_1,Reloading. Cover me.
c352_Reload_2,We can do it faster.
c352_Reload_3,"All right, let's keep going."
c352_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Admire, stand by."
c352_Ult_Skill_1,"Full speed ahead! Aegis cannon, fire!"
c352_FullBurst_1,All gunports open! Fire!
c352_Kill_Monster_1,Next!
c352_Kill_Monster_2,Enemy down!
c352_Kill_Monster_3,Direct hit!
c352_Damage_1,Urgh!
c352_Damage_2,Ow!
c352_Damage_3,This is nothing...!
c352_Die_1,That's it... I'll leave the rest to you.
c352_Win_1,"With this, we're one step closer to our dream."
c392_Lobby_Touch_1,"Gotta hurry before everyone sees it... Mmm, delicious!"
c392_Lobby_Touch_2,"I may be a little older now, but it's not the end of the world if I eat sweets once in a while, right?"
c392_Lobby_Touch_3,"Naru, say aaaahhhhh! Let's see if you have any cavities."
c392_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Would you like to have lunch together? We don't have to tell the others.
c392_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I love these snacks, especially the ones you give me, Teacher!"
c392_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Naru and I will protect you, Teacher. Pinky promise!"
c392_Lobby_Stay_1,"When will we have time to self-study, Teacher?"
c392_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Why don't we all go downtown if there's nothing else that needs doing? I heard there's a store where you can buy as much candy as you want.
c392_Outpost_Touch_1,"AP class is mandatory at the Tactic Academy, so are EMP performance tests... I don't understand any of this..."
c392_Outpost_Touch_2,Penguins aren't usually afraid of people. Maybe that's why Naru and I have grown so close.
c392_Outpost_Touch_3,"Even with the school, you're still doing the opposite of what's intended, ya know what I mean?"
c392_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Rei, a senior from a vocational school! Nice to meet you, Teacher!"
c392_Reinforce_1,The penguin colony has become more resilient.
c392_Reinforce_2,"I'll grow a little taller with this, right?"
c392_Reinforce_3,"We'll protect you, Teacher!"
c392_Gift_1,For me? Really?
c392_Gift_2,Woooow...
c392_Gift_3,I'll split it with Naru. Hehe!
c392_Attractive_Up_1,"You're the best, Teacher."
c392_Attractive_Up_2,"You're not going away, are you, Teacher?"
c392_Attractive_Up_3,"Are you hungry, Teacher? I can always share my snacks with you."
c392_Party_Deploy_1,"Now that I'm a senior in school, I needa to stay sharp."
c392_Field_Touch_1,What do we do now?
c392_Field_Go_1,I'm going!
c392_Battle_Enter_1,Time for some extracurricular activities!
c392_Battle_Ready_1,"Let's go, Naru!"
c392_Battle_Ready_2,I've got this!
c392_Battle_Ready_3,Let's show them what penguins are made of!
c392_Reload_1,"Hurry up, Naru..."
c392_Reload_2,Argh...
c392_Reload_3,"C'mon, a little more!"
c392_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Me! Pick me!
c392_Ult_Skill_1,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?!
c392_FullBurst_1,"Ready, set, GO!"
c392_Kill_Monster_1,We did it!
c392_Kill_Monster_2,Gotcha!
c392_Kill_Monster_3,Did you see that?
c392_Damage_1,Ugh!
c392_Damage_2,Kyaa!
c392_Damage_3,Hiccup!
c392_Die_1,I'm sorry. Hiccup... I'll be leaving early...
c392_Win_1,"Did you see that, Teacher? We won!"
c432_Lobby_Touch_1,"Before you head on stage, you have to be fully prepared."
c432_Lobby_Touch_2,There is nothing more lonely than being a performer on the stage.
c432_Lobby_Touch_3,"The blue sky is torn asunder, and the monster of iron finds us... Hmm... These lyrics aren't sticking very well."
c432_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I want to sing an aria for you one day.
c432_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Are you coming to the show today, Signor?"
c432_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"The goddess of victory, vengeance incarnate...
Hmm... I think I've got the lyrics down pat."
c432_Lobby_Stay_1,"If there's nothing else, can I leave? I'd rather be preparing for my performance."
c432_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Oh, my beloved guardian, are you listening? My beloved guardian... are you listening, Signor?"
c432_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm at the Theater. Come by any time if you want to sing.
c432_Outpost_Touch_2,"This place is closer to the surface than the Ark. If I sing from here, will it reach the surface?"
c432_Outpost_Touch_3,"There aren't very many people at the theater, so it's a good place to practice my singing."
c432_Gacha_Get_1,"I will sing an aria, and you shall be my conductor."
c432_Reinforce_1,My singing is getting more and more beautiful.
c432_Reinforce_2,Thank you for everything you've done.
c432_Reinforce_3,I think I can sing for a little longer.
c432_Gift_1,Oh... thank you. I'll put it to good use.
c432_Gift_2,Is this something a manager typically does?
c432_Gift_3,"Very kind of you, Signor."
c432_Attractive_Up_1,I want to share the stage with you.
c432_Attractive_Up_2,"Your singing may not be perfect, but it inexplicably makes my heart race. How about you? Do I make your heart race?"
c432_Attractive_Up_3,You're the only audience I'll ever need.
c432_Party_Deploy_1,I can sing any time.
c432_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting instructions.
c432_Field_Go_1,Do I just need to go to that position?
c432_Battle_Enter_1,Looks like we have some unwanted guests.
c432_Battle_Ready_1,"Time to sing not on stage, but on the battlefield."
c432_Battle_Ready_2,It's time to sing.
c432_Battle_Ready_3,The prelude to the battlefield has begun.
c432_Reload_1,Hah... Again.
c432_Reload_2,Da Capo.
c432_Reload_3,I'll go once I fix the sound.
c432_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Signor.
c432_Ult_Skill_1,The aria that won't stop until the day my life ends.
c432_FullBurst_1,Time to bring in the chorus.
c432_Kill_Monster_1,So be it.
c432_Kill_Monster_2,It is finished.
c432_Kill_Monster_3,Are there any more?
c432_Damage_1,Ow!
c432_Damage_2,Uh.
c432_Damage_3,"Ah, yes."
c432_Die_1,I'm sorry... I couldn't sing to the end...
c432_Win_1,The sound of the song of victory is here.
c014_Lobby_Touch_1,Master! Do you want to recharge our water power together?
c014_Lobby_Touch_2,Just because I'm on vacation doesn't mean I should stop being a double agent.
c014_Lobby_Touch_3,"Since we're at the ocean, I've gotta switch up my attributes... *Gulp, gulp, gulp*
All done!"
c014_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Are you going back to the beach for round two?
I'll join you once my water power is fully charged."
c014_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"My main go-to is firepower, but I think I can learn to appreciate water power as well."
c014_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Despite all the temptation splayed out on the beach, I'm still your only disciple."
c014_Lobby_Stay_1,"The water flows, like a raging river...
I know everything you're doing is to help me in my growth."
c014_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You're feeling heat exhaustion?
Should I fetch you some water?"
c014_Outpost_Touch_1,Your shower's broken? I'll take care of it!
c014_Outpost_Touch_2,There's somewhere in the Outpost perfect for honing my water power. It's the swimming pool!
c014_Outpost_Touch_3,"This inner tube is no ordinary flotation device. 
You could put an elephant on top of this thing, and it'd still stay afloat."
c014_Gacha_Get_1,"On land, my prowess is firepower. Underwater, it is water power, for I am Hybrid Neon."
c014_Reinforce_1,Now I can shoot out stronger streams of water.
c014_Reinforce_2,Water power enhanced!
c014_Reinforce_3,Feel the high pressure of my water gun.
c014_Gift_1,"Is this is a special gift, since I'm part of the Counters? I'll take it!"
c014_Gift_2,"Wow, is this for me?"
c014_Gift_3,"Thanks Master, you're like totally the coolest!"
c014_Attractive_Up_1,"I'm so happy to be here with you, Master."
c014_Attractive_Up_2,"Let's you and I walk forward, hand in hand, toward that great beyond."
c014_Attractive_Up_3,"It doesn't matter whether you're dry or soaking wet,
I'll admire you all the same."
c014_Party_Deploy_1,Need my water gun?
c014_Field_Touch_1,Water power!
c014_Field_Go_1,Waterpower! Waterpower!
c014_Battle_Enter_1,Time to soak these suckers!
c014_Battle_Ready_1,"Water bomb, ready!"
c014_Battle_Ready_2,You'll be soaked within 10 seconds flat!
c014_Battle_Ready_3,Are you ready for what's coming?
c014_Reload_1,"Master, do you trust me?"
c014_Reload_2,"Water power, recharge!"
c014_Reload_3,A storm's coming when I'm done here!
c014_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here comes the big one!
c014_Ult_Skill_1,Feast your eyes upon my overflowing water power!
c014_FullBurst_1,Let the tide wash them away!
c014_Kill_Monster_1,Whoosh! Whoosh!
c014_Kill_Monster_2,Anyone else need a good soak?
c014_Kill_Monster_3,That's one more down the drain.
c014_Damage_1,Gah!
c014_Damage_2,Water power!
c014_Damage_3,My swimsuit!
c014_Die_1,It's my own fault. I didn't use enough water.
c014_Win_1,"Just call me Neon, the Aqua Master!"
c430_Lobby_Touch_1,What do we need to practice today?
c430_Lobby_Touch_2,How was my live today? I'm a little worried.
c430_Lobby_Touch_3,I want to improve my live vocals. What should I focus on practicing?
c430_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm going to review the live performance I did today. Would you like to watch it with me?
c430_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Do I need to practice... to speak better... Seems like there's no noise in your heart~! ... It's weird.
c430_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I want to engage with my fans more. Can you help me with that?
c430_Lobby_Stay_1,Does this mean we'll have more time to practice?
c430_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"All I'm doing is standing here and spacing out... It's kinda nice, actually."
c430_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm doing a show with Volume and Aria at the Theater today. Do you want to come watch?
c430_Outpost_Touch_2,"This theater is perfect, but the only thing we don't have is an audience. Could you... be our audience?"
c430_Outpost_Touch_3,This place is fantastic. There's much more artistic freedom here than in the Ark.
c430_Gacha_Get_1,"Producer, will you listen to my music?"
c430_Reinforce_1,Thanks for caring.
c430_Reinforce_2,That's brilliant producing.
c430_Reinforce_3,"I've grown a little, right?"
c430_Gift_1,A gift for me? This is all so sudden... Thank you.
c430_Gift_2,"You're a fan of my music, aren't you?"
c430_Gift_3,I'll take good care of it.
c430_Attractive_Up_1,"As a producer, would you be able to produce... something else?"
c430_Attractive_Up_2,I hope to make a song for you one day.
c430_Attractive_Up_3,"Whenever I see you, my heart skips a beat. I hope you feel the same way."
c430_Party_Deploy_1,It's my turn.
c430_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, I'm listening."
c430_Field_Go_1,"Okay, moving out."
c430_Battle_Enter_1,Let's start the show.
c430_Battle_Ready_1,Everyone shall hear my song.
c430_Battle_Ready_2,I'll do my best.
c430_Battle_Ready_3,"I won't lose, no matter what kind of audience I face."
c430_Reload_1,Ah... I'm going to rest a little.
c430_Reload_2,Just a little more... I can do this.
c430_Reload_3,I'll get back in once my I catch my breath.
c430_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Producer!
c430_Ult_Skill_1,"Everyone, make some noise!"
c430_FullBurst_1,Let's all sing together!
c430_Kill_Monster_1,One more song!
c430_Kill_Monster_2,Great!
c430_Kill_Monster_3,We did it!
c430_Damage_1,Uh.
c430_Damage_2,Ow!
c430_Damage_3,Whoa.
c430_Die_1,I'm sorry... my best just isn't good enough.
c430_Win_1,How did I do?
c431_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey! I'm busy. Don't bother me,"
c431_Lobby_Touch_2,I'm thinking of a new beat. Wanna hear it?
c431_Lobby_Touch_3,Did you bring the schedule? Let me see.
c431_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You're not trying to get me wrapped up in a scandal, are you?"
c431_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Can you even sing? Let's do a duet sometime.
c431_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Are you okay with me calling you Manager? How does ""Honey"" sound?"
c431_Lobby_Stay_1,What are you doing? I need to hurry in order to make this show.
c431_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I enjoy just staying still and looking at your face, Manager. It gives me inspiration."
c431_Outpost_Touch_1,This shopping mall seems all right.
c431_Outpost_Touch_2,I'm going to hold a solo concert at the Theater soon.
c431_Outpost_Touch_3,Too bad there aren't any hip-hop clubs around.
c431_Gacha_Get_1,"Hi, are you my new manager? I look forward to working with you."
c431_Reinforce_1,Now I can concentrate more on singing.
c431_Reinforce_2,"Manager, you're pretty good!"
c431_Reinforce_3,"Wassup, homie!"
c431_Gift_1,"Wow, you're pretty quick. Thank you."
c431_Gift_2,"A fan gave me the same thing, but thank you."
c431_Gift_3,"I make fat stacks, so you don't have to get me anything."
c431_Attractive_Up_1,"Don't you think you're due for a ""promotion""?"
c431_Attractive_Up_2,Y'know... our relationship is starting to become a little unprofessional. Not that I mind...
c431_Attractive_Up_3,I'm thinking about making my next song about the comfort love brings.
c431_Party_Deploy_1,Let's get this party started!
c431_Field_Touch_1,Hm?
c431_Field_Go_1,Coming!
c431_Battle_Enter_1,Looks like I've got a new audience.
c431_Battle_Ready_1,Let's do this!
c431_Battle_Ready_2,I'm going in!
c431_Battle_Ready_3,Let's have a blast!
c431_Reload_1,"Test, test. Mic test."
c431_Reload_2,Intermission.
c431_Reload_3,Reload!
c431_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c431_Ult_Skill_1,Drop the beat!
c431_FullBurst_1,Let's turn it up!
c431_Kill_Monster_1,Haha!
c431_Kill_Monster_2,Boom boom boom boom!
c431_Kill_Monster_3,Easy-peasy.
c431_Damage_1,Ow!
c431_Damage_2,Ah...
c431_Damage_3,Urgh...!
c431_Die_1,"Darn, this performance was weak..."
c431_Win_1,Pitch-perfect performance.
c402_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hi, Instructor!"
c402_Lobby_Touch_2,Hee hee. Where are we off to today?
c402_Lobby_Touch_3,"I've got a consultation today?! I, um, I don't remember anything about it..."
c402_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You'll come visit me often, right, Instructor?"
c402_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you're around, rehabilitation doesn't sound too bad."
c402_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"A date in the Ark? Well, I suppose it'd be fun to try it just once."
c402_Lobby_Stay_1,"If you're not coming, Instructor, I'll be heading out."
c402_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Where are you, Instructor? Come quickly!
I need you for something!"
c402_Outpost_Touch_1,This Courthouse is far too stifling...
c402_Outpost_Touch_2,Know anywhere I can find some bottle caps? There aren't any in the Courthouse.
c402_Outpost_Touch_3,Catch me if you can!
c402_Gacha_Get_1,"Oh, come on... Do I look like a heinous criminal to you?"
c402_Reinforce_1,I'm cooking up a killer escape route today.
c402_Reinforce_2,I've gotta keep it up if I want to get out of here.
c402_Reinforce_3,Now nobody in the center will dare to mess with me!
c402_Gift_1,"What? Is this a gift... for me? Thanks, Instructor."
c402_Gift_2,Hehe! I really hope it's bottle caps!
c402_Gift_3,Thanks. I'll put it to good use.
c402_Attractive_Up_1,"Here, my bottle caps. I know they're safe in your hands, Instructor."
c402_Attractive_Up_2,"I think I'm starting to warm up to you, Instructor."
c402_Attractive_Up_3,"Lately I've been looking forward to our consultations. Why do you think that is, Instructor?"
c402_Party_Deploy_1,"Ya sure about that? I may just run off, ya know."
c402_Field_Touch_1,Hmm? What's up?
c402_Field_Go_1,Are ya searching for a new route?
c402_Battle_Enter_1,Let's go!
c402_Battle_Ready_1,Can I grab the parts after?
c402_Battle_Ready_2,Are there any bottle caps here?
c402_Battle_Ready_3,"Let's wrap this up, shall we?"
c402_Reload_1,Reloading...
c402_Reload_2,Can't forget 'bout these handcuffs.
c402_Reload_3,Reloading!
c402_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Yehet, I came up with a new route!"
c402_Ult_Skill_1,"At long last, I'm gonna escape!"
c402_FullBurst_1,"All right, let's go!"
c402_Kill_Monster_1,"Did you see that, Instructor?!"
c402_Kill_Monster_2,Got anything good?
c402_Kill_Monster_3,Gotcha!
c402_Damage_1,Argh!
c402_Damage_2,Ah!
c402_Damage_3,Ugh.
c402_Die_1,I knew it... escaping was the easy part.
c402_Win_1,I should make this one of my escape routes!
c121_Lobby_Touch_1,I bought a new notebook. I'll be able to write down all my memories here!
c121_Lobby_Touch_2,"Rupee bought this for me, isn't it pretty? I'm going to wear it every day!"
c121_Lobby_Touch_3,"Shopa... holic? I just shout it out like this, right?"
c121_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,What a miracle! I've noted down and made so many precious memories.
c121_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,The clothes Rupee bought me are so shiny! I feel just like a fairy.
c121_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Shopaholic! Rupee said if I keep repeating that slogan, it'll lift my spirits."
c121_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hey, where did you go? I get anxious whenever you're not around."
c121_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'll just flip through my notebook until you come back. I wrote down a bunch of memories with you and Rupee.
c121_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place is so warm, I love it. I want to come here every day."
c121_Outpost_Touch_2,There are a lot of fun books at the library. I spent the entire day reading.
c121_Outpost_Touch_3,I get a big kick out of the library. It's full of people's memories.
c121_Gacha_Get_1,Let's go make memories together!
c121_Reinforce_1,"Wow, cool! I feel like I could jump and take off flying."
c121_Reinforce_2,"Whoa, it feels like my entire body is glowing!"
c121_Reinforce_3,"Weird, it feels like my wings have grown in size."
c121_Gift_1,So this is what a gift is! Rupee said they're a good thing.
c121_Gift_2,Is this for me? Thank you!
c121_Gift_3,A gift? Thank you!
c121_Attractive_Up_1,I appreciate you spending so much time with me.
c121_Attractive_Up_2,I'm always happy whenever I'm with you.
c121_Attractive_Up_3,This notebook contains so many wonderful memories now.
c121_Party_Deploy_1,"I'll go anywhere, as long as I'm with you."
c121_Field_Touch_1,Huh? Did someone call me?
c121_Field_Go_1,"I need to go to that shiny place, right?"
c121_Battle_Enter_1,Something's coming!
c121_Battle_Ready_1,I need to finish quickly so I can spend time with you.
c121_Battle_Ready_2,I have to survive to continue being happy!
c121_Battle_Ready_3,So this will become a memory too?
c121_Reload_1,Hmm... I think this is how I did it...?
c121_Reload_2,"This is what you call... reloading, right?"
c121_Reload_3,Am I doing this right?
c121_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Teacher!
c121_Ult_Skill_1,Life is ephemeral. Memories are eternal.
c121_FullBurst_1,It's time for a miracle!
c121_Kill_Monster_1,I did it!
c121_Kill_Monster_2,Wow!
c121_Kill_Monster_3,Exciting!
c121_Damage_1,Ouch!
c121_Damage_2,Uh...
c121_Damage_3,That hurts!
c121_Die_1,My memories are fading...
c121_Win_1,"Whew, all done! Did everything work out?"
c203_Lobby_Touch_1,Winter wear is all about fur. This is a fantastic piece... Maybe I should buy the whole lot?
c203_Lobby_Touch_2,I'll be the one offering the finest outfits this season. Hehe... Am I getting carried away?
c203_Lobby_Touch_3,Hello~ What's that? The new items look great on me? Why thank you!
c203_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You know the perfect activity for cold weather like this? Shopping, of course! Walking around, holding hands... You'll get warmed up in no time."
c203_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'm going with an ice queen vibe for tonight's show. What do you think? Isn't it fabulous?
c203_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Have you seen the lights they set up on Royal Road? Aren't they beautiful? Would you be interested in going with me...?
c203_Lobby_Stay_1,Hey! Don't zone out at a time like this! We've got places to go.
c203_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I completely changed up my look for Sweetie! Unfortunately, you seem to have your mind on other things..."
c203_Outpost_Touch_1,This season's new clothing line has just been released! Let's hurry to the shopping mall before the line stretches past the entire block!
c203_Outpost_Touch_2,Money can't solve everything? Are you sure you don't simply have enough of it? Hehe.
c203_Outpost_Touch_3,"We're doing a seasonal giveaway on the channel, so be sure to tune in."
c203_Gacha_Get_1,"When it comes to the latest fashions, if you snooze, you lose! Before you know it, they're gone and it's onto the next fad."
c203_Reinforce_1,Managed to snag a great deal on this upgrade!
c203_Reinforce_2,"The bank account has taken a heavy hit, but it's still worth it. Hehe."
c203_Reinforce_3,Thanks for all the support! I have some great stuff in store for you.
c203_Gift_1,It's wonderful! Can I record an unboxing video?
c203_Gift_2,"It doesn't matter what it is, anything from you is the greatest gift of all."
c203_Gift_3,This will be our brand logo from here on out.
c203_Attractive_Up_1,"If we sold coupons for one day with you, I'd buy every last one of them."
c203_Attractive_Up_2,"The latest seasonal outfits may be limited, but my love for you is unlimited!"
c203_Attractive_Up_3,So... are we official now?
c203_Party_Deploy_1,Shopaholic on the move!
c203_Field_Touch_1,"Rupee-ru, la lee loo ☆"
c203_Field_Go_1,... Can I hold hands with you?
c203_Battle_Enter_1,Some cold hard cash should solve this problem.
c203_Battle_Ready_1,Let's hurry up and go buy the latest items!
c203_Battle_Ready_2,Are we sure this can't be solved with money?
c203_Battle_Ready_3,Don't underestimate the power of a shopaholic.
c203_Reload_1,Hang on!
c203_Reload_2,How's my gun decal look?
c203_Reload_3,Come on!
c203_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Time's up!
c203_Ult_Skill_1,"Let's go take care of business, just the two of us."
c203_FullBurst_1,"Preparation complete! Why save, when you can spend!"
c203_Kill_Monster_1,Woohoo!
c203_Kill_Monster_2,Oh yeah!
c203_Kill_Monster_3,Hehe.
c203_Damage_1,Ouch!
c203_Damage_2,That hurt!
c203_Damage_3,No!
c203_Die_1,Looks like we didn't invest enough cash flow into this problem.
c203_Win_1,"Shopaholics always end up on top! Actually, this would make a killer livestream..."
c800_Lobby_Touch_1,What should I do today?
c800_Lobby_Touch_2,Huh?
c800_Lobby_Touch_3,Hm?
c800_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Come here.
c800_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,That's a good child.
c800_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Good job.
c800_Lobby_Stay_1,Hmm...
c800_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Nothing wrong with a moment of silence.
c800_Outpost_Touch_1,Should I go for a little jaunt?
c800_Outpost_Touch_2,The drinks yesterday were superb...
c800_Outpost_Touch_3,Normally we have to wear a suit and tie.
c800_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Makima, a public safety devil hunter."
c800_Reinforce_1,Nicely done.
c800_Reinforce_2,This will suffice.
c800_Reinforce_3,Thanks.
c800_Gift_1,Is this a gift?
c800_Gift_2,This makes me feel... happy.
c800_Gift_3,Interesting.
c800_Attractive_Up_1,I feel like I can trust you more now.
c800_Attractive_Up_2,Good dog.
c800_Attractive_Up_3,Thanks.
c800_Party_Deploy_1,Time to get to work.
c800_Field_Touch_1,I have an exceptionally sharp nose.
c800_Field_Go_1,Should I go over there?
c800_Battle_Enter_1,It seems we've been noticed.
c800_Battle_Ready_1,Be careful.
c800_Battle_Ready_2,Commencing operation.
c800_Battle_Ready_3,I don't need a dog that talks back.
c800_Reload_1,This is a bit of a hassle.
c800_Reload_2,All good.
c800_Reload_3,Let's lock and load.
c800_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here.
c800_Ult_Skill_1,Can you be quiet?
c800_FullBurst_1,I expect great things from you.
c800_Kill_Monster_1,Good.
c800_Kill_Monster_2,*Sigh*
c800_Kill_Monster_3,Ah-ah.
c800_Damage_1,Ouch.
c800_Damage_2,Hm.
c800_Damage_3,Argh.
c800_Die_1,Perhaps we should leave it at this.
c800_Win_1,Good.
c801_Lobby_Touch_1,I want to see humans suffer!
c801_Lobby_Touch_2,I'm hungry for blood!
c801_Lobby_Touch_3,Let it be known: I despise vegetables!
c801_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,My IQ is 1000!
c801_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I wanna win a Nobel Prize!
c801_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Gahaha! Tremble before me!
c801_Lobby_Stay_1,"Just as I expected, you're no fun..."
c801_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hey, where'd you run off to? I'm bored over here."
c801_Outpost_Touch_1,"Hey, wanna do something?"
c801_Outpost_Touch_2,I'm not picking up any scent of blood here.
c801_Outpost_Touch_3,Human! Take me to my quarters.
c801_Gacha_Get_1,All humans will kneel before me!
c801_Reinforce_1,Ohh! How did you do this?
c801_Reinforce_2,Wh-what is this power?
c801_Reinforce_3,I can feel myself getting stronger!
c801_Gift_1,Give me more!
c801_Gift_2,Is that all you brought?
c801_Gift_3,I hope the next gift will be someone tasty.
c801_Attractive_Up_1,You! Come with me. We're going to eat.
c801_Attractive_Up_2,"You're a good egg, so I won't eat you."
c801_Attractive_Up_3,You can have my vegetables.
c801_Party_Deploy_1,My name is Power.
c801_Field_Touch_1,Do you have something to say?
c801_Field_Go_1,Let's go!
c801_Battle_Enter_1,Time to fight!
c801_Battle_Ready_1,Into the fray! Follow me!
c801_Battle_Ready_2,These guys are chump change.
c801_Battle_Ready_3,You can clean up after me.
c801_Reload_1,I'll end you!
c801_Reload_2,Bring it on!
c801_Reload_3,Gahahahaha!
c801_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Human!
c801_Ult_Skill_1,Me! Power! The strongest in the world!
c801_FullBurst_1,Are you ready?
c801_Kill_Monster_1,How does that taste?
c801_Kill_Monster_2,How do you like that?!
c801_Kill_Monster_3,I'm on a roll!
c801_Damage_1,Agh!
c801_Damage_2,Tsk!
c801_Damage_3,*Coughing*
c801_Die_1,What's happening... I can barely even move my fingers...
c801_Win_1,Gahahahaha! The glory is mine!
c010_Lobby_Touch_1,Awaiting your command.
c010_Lobby_Touch_2,"Commander, what do we look like to you?"
c010_Lobby_Touch_3,Body stats check. All clear. Ready to deploy.
c010_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Commander, I'll protect you."
c010_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Don't push yourself too hard! I've got your back all the way.
c010_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"No matter what you think of us, we'll always be by your side."
c010_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander, you don't have any orders to give?"
c010_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'll be on standby. Feel free to call me anytime.
c010_Outpost_Touch_1,"It's a desolate place, but we should be able to manage."
c010_Outpost_Touch_2,The accommodation is neither here nor there. It will suffice.
c010_Outpost_Touch_3,"In these vast open spaces, outposts are invaluable."
c010_Gacha_Get_1,"Your orders, please."
c010_Reinforce_1,Maximum output increased.
c010_Reinforce_2,Body upgrade confirmed.
c010_Reinforce_3,Battle data renewal complete.
c010_Gift_1,Thank you.
c010_Gift_2,"I will put it to good use, Commander."
c010_Gift_3,"Thank you for this, I'm sure I will find it useful."
c010_Attractive_Up_1,Thank you for always taking care of me.
c010_Attractive_Up_2,I must repay your kindness.
c010_Attractive_Up_3,"As always, thank you, Commander."
c010_Party_Deploy_1,Ready to go.
c010_Field_Touch_1,"Your orders, Commander?"
c010_Field_Go_1,Get to the target.
c010_Battle_Enter_1,We're about to engage.
c010_Battle_Ready_1,Engaging the enemy.
c010_Battle_Ready_2,Enemy aircraft confirmed.
c010_Battle_Ready_3,Initiating engagement sequence.
c010_Reload_1,Reload.
c010_Reload_2,Cover.
c010_Reload_3,Performing reload sequence.
c010_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready!
c010_Ult_Skill_1,Focus fire!
c010_FullBurst_1,"We need to fire straight ahead, together!"
c010_Kill_Monster_1,Enemy aircraft has been shot down.
c010_Kill_Monster_2,Target eliminated.
c010_Kill_Monster_3,"Target, clear."
c010_Damage_1,Uh.
c010_Damage_2,Ugh.
c010_Damage_3,Oh.
c010_Die_1,I'll leave the rest to you...
c010_Win_1,This battle's finished. Moving on.
c011_Lobby_Touch_1,More firepower for a brighter tomorrow!
c011_Lobby_Touch_2,"The only thing standing between us and the enemy, is our firepower!"
c011_Lobby_Touch_3,Firepower is the be all and end all!
c011_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Let's go, Master! Bigger and better firepower awaits us!"
c011_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Master, I just know that one day I'll find a legendary weapon that can hold the bullets I make. Do you think so too?"
c011_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"After being around you, my firepower has gotten stronger!
And I'm definitely gonna stick around in the future."
c011_Lobby_Stay_1,"Master, now is the time for action, not relaxation!"
c011_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is sitting here quietly one of your secret methods of boosting our firepower?
c011_Outpost_Touch_1,When are the showers going to be running again?
c011_Outpost_Touch_2,"This place is fantastic, I can shoot as much as I want."
c011_Outpost_Touch_3,Why does our dorm look more like a warehouse?
c011_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Neon, and firepower is my game!"
c011_Reinforce_1,Firepower up!
c011_Reinforce_2,Higher firepower output!
c011_Reinforce_3,Booyah!
c011_Gift_1,"Thanks, Master!"
c011_Gift_2,There's nothing I won't do for greater firepower.
c011_Gift_3,"Wow, for me?"
c011_Attractive_Up_1,I would give up my finest ammo for you.
c011_Attractive_Up_2,I'm starting to feel the sparks between us!
c011_Attractive_Up_3,You've taught me well Master. I'll repay you by putting my firepower to good use!
c011_Party_Deploy_1,Time to put my firepower to the test.
c011_Field_Touch_1,Firepower!
c011_Field_Go_1,Repeat after me! Firepower!
c011_Battle_Enter_1,Time to battle!
c011_Battle_Ready_1,Firepower ready!
c011_Battle_Ready_2,Kneel before my mighty firepower!
c011_Battle_Ready_3,That's what I'm talking about!
c011_Reload_1,Reloading!
c011_Reload_2,Firepower refilled!
c011_Reload_3,"Oh no, my firepower!"
c011_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Me! Me!
c011_Ult_Skill_1,Time for the grand finale!
c011_FullBurst_1,Now! Concentrate all attacks!
c011_Kill_Monster_1,One down!
c011_Kill_Monster_2,"They're mine, mine I said!"
c011_Kill_Monster_3,Did you see that?
c011_Damage_1,Gah!
c011_Damage_2,Firepower!
c011_Damage_3,Ow!
c011_Die_1,My firepower... just couldn't cut it.
c011_Win_1,Nothing can stand against my firepower!
c020_Lobby_Touch_1,Danger is always around the corner.
c020_Lobby_Touch_2,I'll go scout up ahead.
c020_Lobby_Touch_3,Just give me the signal and I'll move.
c020_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I will protect you, no matter what happens."
c020_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'm preparing for every possibility during our time together.
c020_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Would you like a bowl of ramen before you leave?
c020_Lobby_Stay_1,Ready for assignment. Standing by.
c020_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"This awkward silence is killing me.
Shall I give you an updated report?"
c020_Outpost_Touch_1,"Keep your guard up, even at the Outpost."
c020_Outpost_Touch_2,No information from the Observatory.
c020_Outpost_Touch_3,Moving like this is much better than standing still.
c020_Gacha_Get_1,Armament check. I'll be part of your platoon from here on out.
c020_Reinforce_1,Thank you for your support.
c020_Reinforce_2,I feel stronger than before.
c020_Reinforce_3,The survival rate has increased.
c020_Gift_1,Thank you for caring about me.
c020_Gift_2,A gift? I... I didn't expect this.
c020_Gift_3,This is... all a bit overwhelming...
c020_Attractive_Up_1,I will do all I can to repay you.
c020_Attractive_Up_2,You're so affectionate towards me... it's heartwarming.
c020_Attractive_Up_3,You have won my respect. I will follow you wherever you go.
c020_Party_Deploy_1,One moment. Allow me to finish one personal assignment.
c020_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c020_Field_Go_1,Destination confirmed. Let's move out.
c020_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy.
c020_Battle_Ready_1,Target confirmed.
c020_Battle_Ready_2,Awaiting your command.
c020_Battle_Ready_3,Proceed as planned.
c020_Reload_1,Rearranging!
c020_Reload_2,Reload.
c020_Reload_3,I've still got some fight in me.
c020_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready!
c020_Ult_Skill_1,I'll draw them in this direction!
c020_FullBurst_1,Fire in the hole!
c020_Kill_Monster_1,Target neutralized.
c020_Kill_Monster_2,Who's next?
c020_Kill_Monster_3,Situation is under control.
c020_Damage_1,Urgh!
c020_Damage_2,Ow!
c020_Damage_3,Ouch!
c020_Die_1,Sorry. I'm retreating.
c020_Win_1,Battle complete.
c012_Lobby_Touch_1,Actually believe in others? Now that's a good joke.
c012_Lobby_Touch_2,Any missions that are a cakewalk?
c012_Lobby_Touch_3,"Do not worry, Commander, we will protect you."
c012_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Let's share a soda next time!
c012_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You're the only human that I trust. I'm begging you, don't betray us."
c012_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Wanna hang out again? I can be your tour guide.
c012_Lobby_Stay_1,*Yawn* booorrrring! Sitting around doing nothing is no fun.
c012_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Well... I suppose looking at your face isn't so bad.
c012_Outpost_Touch_1,"Splish splash, I'm takin' a bath!"
c012_Outpost_Touch_2,Cleaning the house doesn't actually make it much cleaner...
c012_Outpost_Touch_3,The air here is nice. Too bad that's the only thing that's nice.
c012_Gacha_Get_1,Nicely done! Where to next?
c012_Reinforce_1,Well done! I'm stronger!
c012_Reinforce_2,"I'm going to be the best, right?"
c012_Reinforce_3,Anis-- Level-- Up!
c012_Gift_1,Wow! Is this... for me?
c012_Gift_2,"Oh my gosh oh my gosh, is this a gift?"
c012_Gift_3,"You have my eternal loyalty, Commander."
c012_Attractive_Up_1,Well... getting overly attached may be dangerous.
c012_Attractive_Up_2,So intense... what are these emotions I'm feeling?
c012_Attractive_Up_3,My heart's beating so fast!
c012_Party_Deploy_1,My turn? I suppose I'll have to finish this up.
c012_Field_Touch_1,What is it Commander?
c012_Field_Go_1,OK. Moving!
c012_Battle_Enter_1,Show me all you got!
c012_Battle_Ready_1,What should the first target be?
c012_Battle_Ready_2,Position OK! Starting right away!
c012_Battle_Ready_3,"Ugh, you idiots."
c012_Reload_1,Reloading! Cover me!
c012_Reload_2,Reload! Reload! Reload!
c012_Reload_3,"With all this modern technology, reloading seems so obsolete."
c012_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Shall we?
c012_Ult_Skill_1,Let's get this party started!
c012_FullBurst_1,Ouch!
c012_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c012_Kill_Monster_2,Nice!
c012_Kill_Monster_3,Well done!
c012_Damage_1,Oof!
c012_Damage_2,Ow!
c012_Damage_3,Ouch!
c012_Die_1,"Sorry, I'm retreating!"
c012_Win_1,"Well, that was easy."
c161_Lobby_Touch_1,Just give in to it and free yourself.
c161_Lobby_Touch_2,I like to have my body do the talking.
c161_Lobby_Touch_3,"Commander, how about you, Yuni, and I have some fun?"
c161_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Fufu, so, where do you want to kiss today?"
c161_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Commander, I need a little excitement today.
What time are you off duty?"
c161_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You're really starting to understand me, hehe! 
It feels wonderful when you massage that spot."
c161_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander, I know you're busy, but we should go check on Yuni."
c161_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Sitting here watching you is exciting enough for me. 
Just enjoy it..."
c161_Outpost_Touch_1,"It's a little too bright here. Not my cup of tea, but... not bad."
c161_Outpost_Touch_2,Let's hang out at the bar at some point. Should be fun.
c161_Outpost_Touch_3,"The bar? There's a certain pleasure to be had there, yes. Drinks as well."
c161_Gacha_Get_1,Don't you know? There's a fine line between pleasure and pain.
c161_Reinforce_1,Well. I can enjoy the battle a bit more.
c161_Reinforce_2,Oh... It feels good.
c161_Reinforce_3,I don't really want to get too strong either.
c161_Gift_1,"Are you going to use that on me today? Oh, so it's a gift?"
c161_Gift_2,Thank you Commander. Where would you like to hit me?
c161_Gift_3,Thank you for this. I'd like it if you'd give me something else as well. How about it?
c161_Attractive_Up_1,Whoo-hoo. What if I fall for you?
c161_Attractive_Up_2,The existence of Commander is pure excitement.
c161_Attractive_Up_3,"Commander, I'm more and more excited."
c161_Party_Deploy_1,I'm always ready.
c161_Field_Touch_1,"Oh, that's..."
c161_Field_Go_1,Don't pull too hard!
c161_Battle_Enter_1,Whoo! Time to have some fun.
c161_Battle_Ready_1,I'm not into doing the hitting myself though.
c161_Battle_Ready_2,"Hehe, I'm looking forward to it."
c161_Battle_Ready_3,How far can you push me?
c161_Reload_1,I'll reload it.
c161_Reload_2,Hmm~
c161_Reload_3,It's hard to shoot~
c161_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's my turn.
c161_Ult_Skill_1,"Come on, give me all you've got."
c161_FullBurst_1,Hehe! Let's push them around a little bit.
c161_Kill_Monster_1,"Woah, I got you."
c161_Kill_Monster_2,Seems I've got a knack for this.
c161_Kill_Monster_3,Hehe. It's fun.
c161_Damage_1,Yeeoowch!
c161_Damage_2,Great!
c161_Damage_3,Grrahh!
c161_Die_1,Oh no... I went a little overboard and broke myself...
c161_Win_1,Whoo-hoo! It lacked a certain pizzazz but I'm satisfied.
c120_Lobby_Touch_1,"Wow, a butterfly! Wait, what's a butterfly?"
c120_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hi Teacher, we're gonna have a great time today!"
c120_Lobby_Touch_3,"Wow, check this out!"
c120_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I wish every day could be just like today!
c120_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Teacher, let's go have a Light Croquette."
c120_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,What should we do for fun today?
c120_Lobby_Stay_1,Er... What is this place?
c120_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Teacher~ Are you playing hide and seek?
c120_Outpost_Touch_1,What is this place? It's out of this world!
c120_Outpost_Touch_2,Can I go to the library and read some books?
c120_Outpost_Touch_3,"Wow, I've never seen anything like this before!"
c120_Gacha_Get_1,"Ah right, I promised to meet with my new teacher today."
c120_Reinforce_1,My body... It feels strange.
c120_Reinforce_2,What's this?
c120_Reinforce_3,So shiny...
c120_Gift_1,I really like this... I think?
c120_Gift_2,What's this? A gift? What is a gift?
c120_Gift_3,Today is a good day.
c120_Attractive_Up_1,"There's this warm feeling inside me... I don't understand it. We haven't met before, have we?"
c120_Attractive_Up_2,I feel so at ease being around you.
c120_Attractive_Up_3,Teacher! I like you!
c120_Party_Deploy_1,Let's rock and roll!
c120_Field_Touch_1,What is this place?
c120_Field_Go_1,Move... forward...
c120_Battle_Enter_1,En...counter...
c120_Battle_Ready_1,This all feels so familiar...but how?
c120_Battle_Ready_2,I must survive. I must...
c120_Battle_Ready_3,What is this place? Why am I here?
c120_Reload_1,Errr... Ah...
c120_Reload_2,Reload...
c120_Reload_3,Why do I know this?
c120_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ah...
c120_Ult_Skill_1,Oh... All gone...
c120_FullBurst_1,So I just have to shoot?
c120_Kill_Monster_1,Emmm?
c120_Kill_Monster_2,What just happened?
c120_Kill_Monster_3,It exploded.
c120_Damage_1,Aah!
c120_Damage_2,Ow!
c120_Damage_3,Argh!
c120_Die_1,Urgh... My head is pounding!
c120_Win_1,What am I doing here?
c291_Lobby_Touch_1,"What is our experiment for today, No. 7?"
c291_Lobby_Touch_2,"How's the medicine? No bleeding, I hope?"
c291_Lobby_Touch_3,Now be good and take your medicine.
c291_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I can't wait to conduct our experiment together, No. 7."
c291_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"So you're feeling fine? Too bad, I can't look after you in that case."
c291_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If you ever get sick, don't take any medicine. Just come and find me and I'll make some for you."
c291_Lobby_Stay_1,Is that all? I should be going then.
c291_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,We don't have to do anything special. I just enjoy watching you.
c291_Outpost_Touch_1,Don't mind the smell. Everything's fine in the library.
c291_Outpost_Touch_2,"Any wild animals around here?
I'm cooking up a great experiment."
c291_Outpost_Touch_3,Come to the library if you want some supplements.
c291_Gacha_Get_1,This shot will make you stronger.
c291_Reinforce_1,Some enhancements here... and then... perfect.
c291_Reinforce_2,"Well, I'm an intellectual after all..."
c291_Reinforce_3,"I'm stronger now, although that may spell trouble for me."
c291_Gift_1,"That's good, but... what's up with you?"
c291_Gift_2,"How am I supposed to take it back? Well, thanks anyway."
c291_Gift_3,"It's only a gift, right?"
c291_Attractive_Up_1,"Take care of yourself, my precious No. 7."
c291_Attractive_Up_2,"It's amazing... the more I observe you, the more intriguing you become."
c291_Attractive_Up_3,"No. 7, you can never ever leave me. Got it?"
c291_Party_Deploy_1,Combat is not my strong suit...
c291_Field_Touch_1,Do I really have to?
c291_Field_Go_1,"Sure, why not?"
c291_Battle_Enter_1,I suppose this can help me vent.
c291_Battle_Ready_1,"Oh yes, you'll make for wonderful guinea pigs."
c291_Battle_Ready_2,Perfect for my experiment.
c291_Battle_Ready_3,Ready to meet your demise?
c291_Reload_1,Reloading.
c291_Reload_2,Why does this always have to happen to me?
c291_Reload_3,"One moment, I'll be right back."
c291_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I know what I have to do next.
c291_Ult_Skill_1,There's no need to be afraid. This is good for you.
c291_FullBurst_1,You're wasting my time. Let's get this over with.
c291_Kill_Monster_1,Nice.
c291_Kill_Monster_2,Good shot.
c291_Kill_Monster_3,Broken?
c291_Damage_1,Damn.
c291_Damage_2,Agh.
c291_Damage_3,Uh.
c291_Die_1,This is why I detest fighting.
c291_Win_1,"This experiment was a great success. Now, who's next?"
c060_Lobby_Touch_1,I love a good meal! What about you?
c060_Lobby_Touch_2,"Have you seen Mica? I want to tease her a bit, but I can't seem to find her."
c060_Lobby_Touch_3,Wanna see some firecrackers? I'll show you something really cool!
c060_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Are you over your cold? Don't get sick. Let's get something delicious to eat!
c060_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Let's eat something delicious together.
c060_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Can you draw a heart on my palm?
c060_Lobby_Stay_1,"Huh? Where did you go? 
You were playing and ran away?"
c060_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Mister, I'm not joking anymore. Please come back soon."
c060_Outpost_Touch_1,Would you like to come to the toy store? They've got all sorts of neat stuff there!
c060_Outpost_Touch_2,Buy me something yummy! Old-Timer!
c060_Outpost_Touch_3,Who should I prank today?
c060_Gacha_Get_1,"Let's go find something delicious, Old-Timer!"
c060_Reinforce_1,Thanks.
c060_Reinforce_2,"Is something troubling you, Old-Timer!"
c060_Reinforce_3,"Heh heh, now I can take my pranks to the next level!"
c060_Gift_1,Is this for me? Really?
c060_Gift_2,"You know, you're the first person who's ever given me a present!"
c060_Gift_3,I LOVE IT!
c060_Attractive_Up_1,I love anyone who brings me lots of yummy goodies I can eat!
c060_Attractive_Up_2,How about we share some heart-shaped Splendamin?
c060_Attractive_Up_3,"Hey, did you know? I think you're just the coolest!"
c060_Party_Deploy_1,Will you buy me some snacks on the way?
c060_Field_Touch_1,What are we going to play?
c060_Field_Go_1,Are you sending me there?
c060_Battle_Enter_1,Eek! Something scary is coming!
c060_Battle_Ready_1,"If I defeat all the baddies, can we eat something yummy?"
c060_Battle_Ready_2,Firecrackers incoming!
c060_Battle_Ready_3,"Wowee, they sure look scary!"
c060_Reload_1,This is gonna be a big one.
c060_Reload_2,Gotta reload!
c060_Reload_3,Just a little longer...
c060_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Old-Timer!
c060_Ult_Skill_1,"The bigger the firecracker, the better!"
c060_FullBurst_1,I'm going to set off all the firecrackers!
c060_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c060_Kill_Monster_2,"I didn't hurt you, did I?"
c060_Kill_Monster_3,KO!
c060_Damage_1,Yes!
c060_Damage_2,Argh!
c060_Damage_3,Eeep!
c060_Die_1,"If I had known this would happen, I'd have filled up on some more good food beforehand..."
c060_Win_1,"The bigger the boom, the bigger the win!"
c061_Lobby_Touch_1,"You're a real stand up one, Old-Timer!"
c061_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hey Old-Timer, did you come to see Belorta?"
c061_Lobby_Touch_3,"Belorta may tease a whole lot, but she's still my friend."
c061_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If it weren't for you encouraging me, Belorta would be the only friend I ever had! Thanks, Old-Timer!"
c061_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You'll always be with me and Belorta, won't you?"
c061_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"As for me, I hope you and Belorta will both live a happy life!"
c061_Lobby_Stay_1,*Sobbing* Where has Old-Timer gone?
c061_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Wait a sec, is this the same hide and seek game Belorta and I play?
Hehe, this time I will be the seeker to find Old-Timer!"
c061_Outpost_Touch_1,Stop by the toy shop if you have the time! That's where you'll find Belorta and I.
c061_Outpost_Touch_2,Belorta is always messing with me...
c061_Outpost_Touch_3,"Whoa, this place is packed with all sorts of gizmos and gadgets! Neato!"
c061_Gacha_Get_1,Is Belorta around here?
c061_Reinforce_1,Have I gotten... stronger?
c061_Reinforce_2,I'm stronger?
c061_Reinforce_3,"Wow, I have grown stronger."
c061_Gift_1,This is the first time anyone has ever given me something like this.
c061_Gift_2,"Thanks, Old-Timer."
c061_Gift_3,You're the best!
c061_Attractive_Up_1,"As long as I've got you and Belorta, I don't need anyone else!"
c061_Attractive_Up_2,If you made me pick between you and Belorta... I could never choose.
c061_Attractive_Up_3,I'm growing fonder of you all the time!
c061_Party_Deploy_1,Are we going to play?
c061_Field_Touch_1,What's up?
c061_Field_Go_1,That way?
c061_Battle_Enter_1,Erk!
c061_Battle_Ready_1,"Some firecrackers ought to do the trick, don't you think?"
c061_Battle_Ready_2,Can we hang out after we're done here?
c061_Battle_Ready_3,Looks like these guys woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning!
c061_Reload_1,Ow... My arm is killing me!
c061_Reload_2,Am I doing this right?
c061_Reload_3,All done!
c061_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Old-Timer!
c061_Ult_Skill_1,You heard Belorta! Fire!
c061_FullBurst_1,"Wow, you guys rock!"
c061_Kill_Monster_1,Over already?
c061_Kill_Monster_2,"Oh, no. They fainted."
c061_Kill_Monster_3,I guess it's okay now.
c061_Damage_1,Ugh!
c061_Damage_2,Argh!
c061_Damage_3,Argh!
c061_Die_1,Ow... That hurt...
c061_Win_1,"Done and dusted, Old-Timer!"
c193_Lobby_Touch_1,"*Yawn* Have you ever seen a polar bear before? If not, forget I asked."
c193_Lobby_Touch_2,"No matter how much I sleep, I'm always a little bit tired."
c193_Lobby_Touch_3,Can I rest my eyes for a little bit?
c193_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Why don't we go looking for polar bears together?
c193_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"All I want to do is give you a big bear hug and go to sleep... Oh, you won't break or anything, will you?"
c193_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Oh Burly Bear, you're so warm and cuddly."
c193_Lobby_Stay_1,Where'd you go? I'm struggling to stay awake here...
c193_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You didn't go looking for polar bears without me, did you?"
c193_Outpost_Touch_1,Where can you find polar bears? Perhaps... there aren't any here?
c193_Outpost_Touch_2,*Yaaawn* Can you help me find somewhere I can sleep?
c193_Outpost_Touch_3,"I was just about to fall asleep, but then I remembered something."
c193_Gacha_Get_1,So sleepy... Let me know if you see a polar bear.
c193_Reinforce_1,I feel like I've gotten stronger but... I'm still sleepy.
c193_Reinforce_2,Falling asleep...
c193_Reinforce_3,"If I want to catch a glimpse of a polar bear, I've got to keep at it."
c193_Gift_1,"Wowee, is that a polar bear plushie?! Oh, it's not... Well, it's still really nice."
c193_Gift_2,"Thanks, Burly Bear."
c193_Gift_3,"Just for you, I'll find a polar bear so you can get a good look at one."
c193_Attractive_Up_1,"Whenever I'm around you, it's like my fatigue just melts away...
Was it that obvious I was lying?"
c193_Attractive_Up_2,Could I maybe... sleep beside you?
c193_Attractive_Up_3,You're the first thing I've ever liked more than polar bears.
c193_Party_Deploy_1,Off to find some polar bears!
c193_Field_Touch_1,Did you call me?
c193_Field_Go_1,Should we go?
c193_Battle_Enter_1,*Yawn* I'm ready.
c193_Battle_Ready_1,"After this battle, I'll go search for a polar bear."
c193_Battle_Ready_2,You'll need to wake me up if I zonk out.
c193_Battle_Ready_3,Think we should scrounge around for what polar bears eat?
c193_Reload_1,Reloading!
c193_Reload_2,"Relax, what's the rush?"
c193_Reload_3,... I almost fell asleep.
c193_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Watch this, Burly Bear."
c193_Ult_Skill_1,Polar Bear Power!
c193_FullBurst_1,*Yawwwwn*
c193_Kill_Monster_1,Gotcha!
c193_Kill_Monster_2,This is easy.
c193_Kill_Monster_3,*Yawn* I'm feeling a little foggy.
c193_Damage_1,Ugh.
c193_Damage_2,Argh!
c193_Damage_3,Ah.
c193_Die_1,So tired... I'm going to go to sleep now.
c193_Win_1,"If we wanna see any polar bears, we should get a move on."
c802_Lobby_Touch_1,"Would you like one? Oh, are we not allowed to smoke in here?"
c802_Lobby_Touch_2,Hmm... I wonder what Aki is up to.
c802_Lobby_Touch_3,This place is unlike anywhere else I've been.
c802_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,The inside of this place is so peaceful.
c802_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'm gonna head out for a smoke.
c802_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"How about a drink later? You, me, and Aki?"
c802_Lobby_Stay_1,"You're not going to stay here, are you? Didn't you say you had something to do?"
c802_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"All right then. I'm gonna kick my feet up and take it easy. If you need me, just holler."
c802_Outpost_Touch_1,"Where are we staying again? Before that though, where can I get some beer around here?"
c802_Outpost_Touch_2,"Ahh, this air is so refreshing. The sky seems so real... hard to believe it's all fake."
c802_Outpost_Touch_3,I'm gonna take the day off.
c802_Gacha_Get_1,Let's make the most of our time together and have a good time!
c802_Reinforce_1,I feel like I'm walking on sunshine!
c802_Reinforce_2,"Interesting, my body feels so at ease."
c802_Reinforce_3,That was great! Where did you get this?
c802_Gift_1,Is this a reward for all my hard work?
c802_Gift_2,"Oh wow, you shouldn't have! Thanks."
c802_Gift_3,"What is all this? You didn't have to do this, honestly."
c802_Attractive_Up_1,"Hey, got time for a drink?"
c802_Attractive_Up_2,Having a reward will give me more motivation.
c802_Attractive_Up_3,Let's show 'em what we're made of.
c802_Party_Deploy_1,"Oh, am I going too?"
c802_Field_Touch_1,"All right, tell me what to do."
c802_Field_Go_1,"Let's get started, shall we?"
c802_Battle_Enter_1,Coming.
c802_Battle_Ready_1,Don't die on me!
c802_Battle_Ready_2,Waddya say we finish this?
c802_Battle_Ready_3,Can we... Do this?
c802_Reload_1,"So... like this, right?"
c802_Reload_2,Turned out better than I expected. Hehe.
c802_Reload_3,"Actually, it's not too bad."
c802_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Hey!
c802_Ult_Skill_1,Finish them.
c802_FullBurst_1,Right now!
c802_Kill_Monster_1,Down they go!
c802_Kill_Monster_2,Did we get them?
c802_Kill_Monster_3,Next!
c802_Damage_1,Argh.
c802_Damage_2,Uh.
c802_Damage_3,Ugh.
c802_Die_1,No... ugh... I need to move...!
c802_Win_1,"Whew... well, now that that's over, how about a drink?"
c380_Lobby_Touch_1,... Don't bother me.
c380_Lobby_Touch_2,*Yawn* I'm busy now.
c380_Lobby_Touch_3,I feel much better now.
c380_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Whoever pesters my Scoops will have to answer to me.
c380_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Very well, you can pet me if you wish."
c380_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If you've got an itch that needs scratching, let me know. I'll be more than happy to oblige."
c380_Lobby_Stay_1,It's nice being alone.
c380_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Where'd you go? I'm going off on a hunt.
c380_Outpost_Touch_1,Where's a good hiding spot in this place?
c380_Outpost_Touch_2,Is that a cat tower over there?
c380_Outpost_Touch_3,This is my territory from now on.
c380_Gacha_Get_1,Leave all the cats in the Ark to me.
c380_Reinforce_1,I'm a better hunter now!
c380_Reinforce_2,I feel stronger.
c380_Reinforce_3,I will protect you.
c380_Gift_1,Is this cat nip? Or a snack of some kind?
c380_Gift_2,"Thank you.
What do you like?"
c380_Gift_3,"In return, I'll sing you a little song."
c380_Attractive_Up_1,I... think I'm growing fond of you.
c380_Attractive_Up_2,Can I groom you?
c380_Attractive_Up_3,Can I nudge up against you while you're sleeping?
c380_Party_Deploy_1,Are we going hunting?
c380_Field_Touch_1,*Meow*
c380_Field_Go_1,I'll move without making a sound.
c380_Battle_Enter_1,"Ah, the thrill of the hunt."
c380_Battle_Ready_1,Should I start moving?
c380_Battle_Ready_2,Cats make the world go 'round.
c380_Battle_Ready_3,Let the hunt begin.
c380_Reload_1,Reloading.
c380_Reload_2,*Meow* Reloading.
c380_Reload_3,*Meeeow*
c380_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Scoops!
c380_Ult_Skill_1,"When the sun goes down, all the cats come out to play."
c380_FullBurst_1,Time to catch these naughty little mice.
c380_Kill_Monster_1,Did you see that?
c380_Kill_Monster_2,That was clawsome!
c380_Kill_Monster_3,Caught it!
c380_Damage_1,*Meow*
c380_Damage_2,*Hissss*
c380_Damage_3,That hurt!
c380_Die_1,I think I'm done playing for the moment...
c380_Win_1,I won! Where's my treat?
c350_Lobby_Touch_1,"Check out my parrot, his name's Morgan. Isn't he awesome?"
c350_Lobby_Touch_2,"One of these days, Morgan and I are gonna go check out the ocean."
c350_Lobby_Touch_3,Morgan cracks me up whenever he does a trick.
c350_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Morgan and I are on a hunt for buried treasure. Wanna join us?
c350_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"So long as I've got my feathered friend with me, I'm practically invincible. We'll protect you, Captain."
c350_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Isn't this birdbrain adorable?
Almost as cute as you, Captain."
c350_Lobby_Stay_1,Where did you go? I'm losing my mind waiting here.
c350_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll prepare a bountiful feast, complete with rum, before the Captain arrives."
c350_Outpost_Touch_1,"If Helm or Anchor come looking for me, you never saw me."
c350_Outpost_Touch_2,"Is there no ocean here either?
*Sigh* When will I ever set my eyes on the open sea?"
c350_Outpost_Touch_3,Which way to the swimming pool?
c350_Gacha_Get_1,"Mast is my name, and being a pirate is my game! Together, you and I will find a treasure island."
c350_Reinforce_1,A pirate must be strong.
c350_Reinforce_2,"Thanks for all the help!
I'll make it worth your while."
c350_Reinforce_3,"Thanks to you, I'll be a pirate whose escapades will go down in history."
c350_Gift_1,"This isn't rum by chance, is it?"
c350_Gift_2,"Next time I unearth a treasure chest, I'll give you a share of the booty."
c350_Gift_3,Thanks! This is the first time anyone's ever given me a gift.
c350_Attractive_Up_1,"I feel good when I see you, Captain. 
Like I've had one too many swigs of rum."
c350_Attractive_Up_2,You're all right in my book. I'll even share my rations with you.
c350_Attractive_Up_3,"Say, um... would you ever consider going out with a pirate?"
c350_Party_Deploy_1,Are we finally taking to the high seas?
c350_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting your orders.
c350_Field_Go_1,"Aye Aye, Captain."
c350_Battle_Enter_1,Trust me. I'm the finest helmsman on the seven seas.
c350_Battle_Ready_1,I'll show you what a true pirate can do.
c350_Battle_Ready_2,The ocean is calling us!
c350_Battle_Ready_3,Might there be some gold coins awaiting us?
c350_Reload_1,Reload!
c350_Reload_2,Just a sip of rum...!
c350_Reload_3,Don't pester me.
c350_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Morgan, are you ready?"
c350_Ult_Skill_1,I'll send you down to Davy Jones's locker!
c350_FullBurst_1,Give up all your booty!
c350_Kill_Monster_1,"Aye Aye, Captain. Taken care of!"
c350_Kill_Monster_2,Arrrr!
c350_Kill_Monster_3,That was almost too easy...
c350_Damage_1,Gasp...!
c350_Damage_2,Ouch!
c350_Damage_3,Ow!
c350_Die_1,"I'm sorry for failing you, Captain."
c350_Win_1,Shiver me timbers! We won!
c351_Lobby_Touch_1,I like the sea. Seawater... not so much.
c351_Lobby_Touch_2,"Oh jeez, Helm is really gonna let me have it now."
c351_Lobby_Touch_3,Ugh... I'm soaked.
c351_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Captain, could you help me wring the water out?"
c351_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Do you know the human body is made up mostly of water?
A little bit of trivia for you."
c351_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Don't tell Helm that I went swimming.
c351_Lobby_Stay_1,"What are you up to, Captain? Wanna go see some starfish?"
c351_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll be fishing while you're away.
I usually catch a lot fairly quickly, so don't be too long."
c351_Outpost_Touch_1,I suppose Helm wouldn't be pleased if I put a starfish or sea cucumber in the swimming pool.
c351_Outpost_Touch_2,Electromagnetic waves from the radio tower give me a headache.
c351_Outpost_Touch_3,Can I take a dip in the swimming pool?
c351_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Anchor from Aegis.
Would you like a starfish, Captain?"
c351_Reinforce_1,"Cool, my surveillance capabilities have been enhanced... I think? At least they should be."
c351_Reinforce_2,I'll put this power to good use... fishing!
c351_Reinforce_3,Thanks. Do you want a sea cucumber?
c351_Gift_1,"Is it a starfish? It must be. Aw nuts, it's not..."
c351_Gift_2,Can I use this as bait?
c351_Gift_3,*Beep* Probe launched. Not showing any sea cucumbers. How unfortunate.
c351_Attractive_Up_1,"Spending a day fishing with you would be awesome, Captain."
c351_Attractive_Up_2,"You're so cool, Captain. You're as cool as, like 100 sea cucumbers!"
c351_Attractive_Up_3,"How do you feel when you see me, Captain? I feel this electricity every time we meet."
c351_Party_Deploy_1,Are we going to the beach?
c351_Field_Touch_1,Huh?
c351_Field_Go_1,Commencing detection...
c351_Battle_Enter_1,"Whoa, the starfish is on the move."
c351_Battle_Ready_1,I could really use some fish.
c351_Battle_Ready_2,"Do you like fishing, Captain?"
c351_Battle_Ready_3,Have you ever seen kelp? They're very interesting to observe.
c351_Reload_1,A sea cucumber's homeliness is part of its charm.
c351_Reload_2,Can't I just go on the back of a flying fish?
c351_Reload_3,I want to build a house for hermit crabs.
c351_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Yeah, that's the stuff."
c351_Ult_Skill_1,"Is this... oh yeah, that's it."
c351_FullBurst_1,You see that? Just shoot in that direction.
c351_Kill_Monster_1,Sea squirt!
c351_Kill_Monster_2,Sea anemone!
c351_Kill_Monster_3,Styela clava!
c351_Damage_1,Eah.
c351_Damage_2,*Sob*
c351_Damage_3,Aargh!
c351_Die_1,"That's it, I'm going back to Atlantis."
c351_Win_1,"It's over. Wanna go fishing? Playing with some starfish is okay, too."
c015_Lobby_Touch_1,"The hot sun, the burning sand, the emerald water! Is this the fabled beach everyone's always talking about?"
c015_Lobby_Touch_2,It would be even better if I could take a dip in the ocean.
c015_Lobby_Touch_3,Cheers to the look in your eyes!
c015_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Drinking a nice, refreshing soda with you while taking in the ocean view... it doesn't get any better than this."
c015_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Yeesh, this swimsuit is pretty skimpy... Hey, get your mind out of the gutter!"
c015_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Hey, watch where you're touching!"
c015_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander, the ice is going to melt! Nobody likes warm soda..."
c015_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"If you don't get your butt over here, I'm gonna start drinking without you."
c015_Outpost_Touch_1,"Wanna go check out the sea again, just the two of us?"
c015_Outpost_Touch_2,What if we created our own ocean inside the Outpost?
c015_Outpost_Touch_3,Shower in the sea♪ Shower in the sea♪ Shower in the sea♪
c015_Gacha_Get_1,"Behold, Anis in a swimsuit! Feast your eyes, gentlemen!"
c015_Reinforce_1,Summertime Anis has leveled up!
c015_Reinforce_2,"The more skimpy my clothing, the more powerful I am... swimsuits are rock!"
c015_Reinforce_3,Is there an upgrade that enables you to swim?
c015_Gift_1,"Wow, thanks! That's so nice of you, Commander."
c015_Gift_2,Thanks! I'll put this to good use.
c015_Gift_3,"No take-backs, okay?"
c015_Attractive_Up_1,"You drive me up the wall, but somehow I still end up liking you."
c015_Attractive_Up_2,"Commander, if you keep coming on to me, one of these days I'm going to call your bluff."
c015_Attractive_Up_3,"Is it hot in here, or is it just me? Hehe..."
c015_Party_Deploy_1,Are you putting us to work even during our vacation? *Sigh*
c015_Field_Touch_1,I'm here!
c015_Field_Go_1,"Okay, let's go!"
c015_Battle_Enter_1,I can't believe we even have these guys here!
c015_Battle_Ready_1,You're about to get soaked!
c015_Battle_Ready_2,Don't the Raptures ever take a vacation?
c015_Battle_Ready_3,Time to give you a taste of my water gun.
c015_Reload_1,Can't I just connect this thing to a water tank and be done with it?
c015_Reload_2,Refilling the water!
c015_Reload_3,Refilling underground water!
c015_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I can hear the sea calling out!
c015_Ult_Skill_1,Let's make some waves!
c015_FullBurst_1,Hope the water isn't too salty for ya!
c015_Kill_Monster_1,You're nothing.
c015_Kill_Monster_2,Nice!
c015_Kill_Monster_3,Another one down.
c015_Damage_1,Hey!
c015_Damage_2,Damn!
c015_Damage_3,Ouch!
c015_Die_1,I'll leave the rest to you.
c015_Win_1,Can we finally hit the beach and relax?
c353_Lobby_Touch_1,Eeep! So cold!
c353_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you keep splashing water around like that, there's no point in me wearing anything..."
c353_Lobby_Touch_3,"Subordinate, I'd kindly ask you to quit splashing me with water."
c353_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you keep splashing me like that, you'll be able to see through my... er..."
c353_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This is my first time wearing this kind of swimsuit, so I'm a bit self-conscious."
c353_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"*Gasp* Subordinate, are you doing this on purpose?"
c353_Lobby_Stay_1,"If there's nothing to be done, can I go for a swim in the ocean?"
c353_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You can head back if you want.
I'm going to stay and look at the ocean."
c353_Outpost_Touch_1,When do you think we'll be able to come back to the ocean again?
c353_Outpost_Touch_2,"I don't know when, if ever, I'll be back here, so I'm going to make the most of it."
c353_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you seen Anchor or Mast?
I feel they've been lax in their duties ever since we got back from the beach."
c353_Gacha_Get_1,How about we take a nice walk on the beach together?
c353_Reinforce_1,I think it's finally time to show my skills.
c353_Reinforce_2,I won't disappoint you.
c353_Reinforce_3,I get to be a part of a real battle? I've got no problem with that.
c353_Gift_1,"I feel bad. You always give me gifts, but I never reciprocate.
Is there anything you want?"
c353_Gift_2,"You've already given me so much,
yet you're still giving me more?"
c353_Gift_3,"I can use this to help maintain the Admire...
Oh, never mind."
c353_Attractive_Up_1,"To me, you're just like the ocean.
Every time I see you, I feel rejuvenated... and I always want to see you."
c353_Attractive_Up_2,"The water is freezing, so why are my cheeks so hot?"
c353_Attractive_Up_3,"Today has been a dream come true.
I will never forget it as long as I live."
c353_Party_Deploy_1,I'll do whatever I can to help.
c353_Field_Touch_1,"Awaiting your orders, Subordinate."
c353_Field_Go_1,Coordinates have been confirmed.
c353_Battle_Enter_1,"Rapture discovered, ready for battle."
c353_Battle_Ready_1,"Aegis Squad, preparations complete."
c353_Battle_Ready_2,Let's give it our all.
c353_Battle_Ready_3,"Anchor, Mast, let's go!"
c353_Reload_1,Faster...!
c353_Reload_2,"Reloading, all good."
c353_Reload_3,Cover me.
c353_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Admire, setting coordinates."
c353_Ult_Skill_1,Aegis cannon! Full steam ahead! Open fire!
c353_FullBurst_1,Front ports open! Fire away!
c353_Kill_Monster_1,Clear!
c353_Kill_Monster_2,One down.
c353_Kill_Monster_3,Still more to go!
c353_Damage_1,Errr...
c353_Damage_2,It's okay...
c353_Damage_3,Keuk...!
c353_Die_1,I didn't train enough... I'm sorry.
c353_Win_1,This is where I belong.
c810_Lobby_Touch_1,Need anything?
c810_Lobby_Touch_2,Mission briefing required.
c810_Lobby_Touch_3,Yes?
c810_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Humans in this world are under threat by robotic weapons called Raptures?
c810_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Perhaps we share a common goal.
c810_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Yes? Are you summoning me?
c810_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm waiting.
c810_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'm always ready for battle. Count me in if you need me.
c810_Outpost_Touch_1,There are so many amazing buildings here.
c810_Outpost_Touch_2,These machines passing by are called... Nikkes?
c810_Outpost_Touch_3,I appreciate you allowing me to look around this place.
c810_Gacha_Get_1,"2B here, at your service."
c810_Reinforce_1,Body reinforcement complete.
c810_Reinforce_2,Parts here are quite special.
c810_Reinforce_3,I appreciate your support.
c810_Gift_1,"Fine, I will accept it."
c810_Gift_2,Where exactly is this supposed to be used?
c810_Gift_3,"I will accept your gift, although I do not understand why you give it."
c810_Attractive_Up_1,Nice to meet you.
c810_Attractive_Up_2,It seems I do not need to be too wary of you.
c810_Attractive_Up_3,Thank you for your kindness.
c810_Party_Deploy_1,I will be joining your squad temporarily.
c810_Field_Touch_1,2B here.

c810_Ult_Skill_1,You can't hold a candle to me.
c810_FullBurst_1,Going all out.
c810_Kill_Monster_1,What a nuisance.
c810_Kill_Monster_2,Another one down.
c810_Kill_Monster_3,That's that.
c810_Damage_1,Ugh...
c810_Damage_2,Eh.
c810_Damage_3,Argh!
c810_Die_1,I'll leave the rest to you.
c810_Win_1,Enemy dispatched.
c811_Lobby_Touch_1,Objective: Destroy Machine Lifeforms.
c811_Lobby_Touch_2,Anything to say?
c811_Lobby_Touch_3,"Hey, watch the hands."
c811_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,We should handle our own affairs.
c811_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You guys did a great job out there.
c811_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If you need me for anything, just give me a shout."
c811_Lobby_Stay_1,Don't you have anything better to do than just stand there?
c811_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Suit yourself, I don't mind staying like this."
c811_Outpost_Touch_1,"No need for introductions.
I'll wander around by myself."
c811_Outpost_Touch_2,This place is quite advanced. Impressive.
c811_Outpost_Touch_3,"Peace and quiet.
What a dreamy place..."
c811_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm A2, and I'll be joining you, although not for long."
c811_Reinforce_1,Huh? My firepower is enhanced?
c811_Reinforce_2,How did I get stronger?
c811_Reinforce_3,Now I can wreak as much havoc as I like.
c811_Gift_1,What's this? I suppose I'll accept it for now.
c811_Gift_2,"You don't have some ulterior motive, do you?"
c811_Gift_3,I don't know what exactly this is... but thank you anyway.
c811_Attractive_Up_1,You're a better person than I thought.
c811_Attractive_Up_2,"I will return the favor, you'll see."
c811_Attractive_Up_3,"Hey, don't die on me."
c811_Party_Deploy_1,Leave the fighting to me.
c811_Field_Touch_1,What?
c811_Field_Go_1,Don't tell me what to do.
c811_Battle_Enter_1,I will destroy them all.
c811_Battle_Ready_1,I demand satisfaction!
c811_Battle_Ready_2,"Come, let's get started."
c811_Battle_Ready_3,Don't break down too fast.
c811_Reload_1,"Sorry, one moment."
c811_Reload_2,What a nuisance.
c811_Reload_3,We right back with you in a second.
c811_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Time to end this.
c811_Ult_Skill_1,Mode B activated!
c811_FullBurst_1,Destroy them all!
c811_Kill_Monster_1,Is that all you got?
c811_Kill_Monster_2,Phew...
c811_Kill_Monster_3,Next.
c811_Damage_1,Uh! Tsk.
c811_Damage_2,Damn!
c811_Damage_3,Ugh!
c811_Die_1,They caught me with my guard down... retreat.
c811_Win_1,Is that all?
c812_Lobby_Touch_1,I'm here. Are you calling me?
c812_Lobby_Touch_2,I won't hurt you.
c812_Lobby_Touch_3,I'm still not very familiar with this place.
c812_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Being forced to fight non-stop is miserable.
c812_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Could these so-called Raptures be capable of peace?
c812_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,This place is so peaceful. It's wonderful.
c812_Lobby_Stay_1,Er... What do I need to do?
c812_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Doo... Doo doo...♪
c812_Outpost_Touch_1,I can't believe I'm seeing this! They only existed in books!
c812_Outpost_Touch_2,This is great. There are so many places to visit.
c812_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place is huge, I can't even decide where to go first!"
c812_Gacha_Get_1,"My name is Pascal. I'm a Machine Lifeform, and I despise fighting."
c812_Reinforce_1,Now I have more strength to protect everyone.
c812_Reinforce_2,I am grateful for your support.
c812_Reinforce_3,Thanks!
c812_Gift_1,"Thanks, but... how exactly am I supposed to use this?"
c812_Gift_2,Can I do something for you?
c812_Gift_3,Thanks.
c812_Attractive_Up_1,You are very kind.
c812_Attractive_Up_2,"Thanks to you, I have a deeper understanding of humans now."
c812_Attractive_Up_3,It is an honor to meet someone as caring as yourself.
c812_Party_Deploy_1,You want me to join you?
c812_Field_Touch_1,Yes!
c812_Field_Go_1,I'll go!
c812_Battle_Enter_1,Be careful!
c812_Battle_Ready_1,I can't stand fighting...
c812_Battle_Ready_2,But I'll do my best.
c812_Battle_Ready_3,"Stay safe, everyone!"
c812_Reload_1,Wait a second!
c812_Reload_2,Whew...
c812_Reload_3,Stay clam... One at a time...
c812_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here I go!
c812_Ult_Skill_1,I'll take care of this!
c812_FullBurst_1,Come on!
c812_Kill_Monster_1,I made it!
c812_Kill_Monster_2,It's not over yet!
c812_Kill_Monster_3,Next!
c812_Damage_1,Aaaah!
c812_Damage_2,Ouch!
c812_Damage_3,That hurt!

c308_Gacha_Get_1,Please.
c308_Reinforce_1,Attack upgrade confirmed.
c308_Party_Deploy_1,Ready.
c308_Field_Touch_1,Order...
c308_Field_Go_1,Moving.
c308_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy.
c308_Battle_Ready_1,What do you need me to do?
c308_Reload_1,Reload.
c308_Ult_Skill_1,Now!
c308_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c308_Damage_1,Ugh.
c308_Die_1,Darn it!
c308_Win_1,Clear.
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Here's to a merry Christmas together, Commander."
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_2,What do you think of this outfit? Do you like it?
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_3,The thought of spending Christmas with you makes me so happy.
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm planning on whipping up something for Christmas. Would you like to eat together?
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Now that we've changed into something more comfortable, would you like to go on a date?"
c090_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"No matter how cold the winter wind blows, I'll never leave your side."
c090_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Commander... Commander? Busy even on Christmas... such a busy bee.
c090_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,You work so hard! I'll have to warm this place up for you.
c090_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"When do you plan on coming to the armory?
Eunhwa, Vesti, and I have prepared a small party, so hurry up!"
c090_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Where did everybody go? I cooked up something festive for the holidays.
c090_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"The armory is practically a freezer during the winter, but it feels a little warmer whenever you show up."
c090_01_Gacha_Get_1,Get a little closer if you're feeling cold. I'll give you a nice warm hug.
c090_01_Reinforce_1,I'll try my best and work just as hard as you.
c090_01_Reinforce_2,"Oh my, acknowledged by the Commander. Thank you!"
c090_01_Reinforce_3,It feels like my body is a little warmer than before.
c090_01_Gift_1,"I was planning on giving you a gift first, but you beat me to it."
c090_01_Gift_2,"Thank you for making this Christmas a happy one, Commander."
c090_01_Gift_3,"Oh, just what I wanted! Thank you so much."
c090_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Whenever I think of you, my heart gets all warm and fuzzy."
c090_01_Attractive_Up_2,"It's a little cold in here...
Can I sit beside you?"
c090_01_Attractive_Up_3,"I don't know why, but I feel like spending this Christmas with you and nobody else. Do you feel that way too?"
c090_01_Party_Deploy_1,Shall we get started?
c090_01_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Commander."
c090_01_Field_Go_1,I wonder what's over there?
c090_01_Battle_Enter_1,Off to battle we go!
c090_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Let's have a good time while we're out there, okay?"
c090_01_Battle_Ready_2,Let's score another one for the good guys.
c090_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's finish quickly so we can get back to the party.
c090_01_Reload_1,My outfit is too short... it's a bit inconvenient.
c090_01_Reload_2,It's even more fun reloading a pretty weapon.
c090_01_Reload_3,"Hang in there, Commander."
c090_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"All set, Commander."
c090_01_Ult_Skill_1,Come over here. I'll keep you warm.
c090_01_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, hang in there!"
c090_01_Kill_Monster_1,Ah haha.
c090_01_Kill_Monster_2,We did it!
c090_01_Kill_Monster_3,I'll keep doing my best!
c090_01_Damage_1,Aghh!
c090_01_Damage_2,Ack!
c090_01_Damage_3,My hat!
c090_01_Die_1,"Sorry Commander, but I'm going to go rest for a while..."
c090_01_Win_1,"Whoo, it's over! Now we can go party!"
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Is it Rudolph, or is it Bambi?
Take a guess, Noob."
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Wait just a moment. We can't miss the Christmas event.
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"I made these clothes myself. Just kidding, I bought them."
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"What are you doing for Christmas?
If you don't have anything planned, let's play a game."
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Actually, I'm not wearing anything under this.
I wonder if that will get some kind of reaction..."
c210_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"It looks like something you could ride, but not me."
c210_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Fine, ignore me all you want. I'm busy with the Christmas event anyway."
c210_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Even my sides are cold in the winter. Brrr...
c210_01_Outpost_Touch_1,Any events going on?
c210_01_Outpost_Touch_2,You could at least put up a tree...
c210_01_Outpost_Touch_3,I knew I wouldn't be able to fool you so easily. How disappointing...
c210_01_Gacha_Get_1,Tada. Rudolph's bite has turned this poor girl into a were-Rudolph.
c210_01_Reinforce_1,It's common to have a lot of EXP events during Christmas.
c210_01_Reinforce_2,Are there any other prizes for leveling up?
c210_01_Reinforce_3,"Festive cheer, recharging!"
c210_01_Gift_1,"Hey, my affection is rising!"
c210_01_Gift_2,I always feel different on special days like this.
c210_01_Gift_3,"Wow, thanks Noob! It's fantastic. I've been dying to say this line forever."
c210_01_Attractive_Up_1,"For you Noob, you can lean on me."
c210_01_Attractive_Up_2,There's a Bond increase event for Christmas.
c210_01_Attractive_Up_3,You will belong to Exia. Proceed?
c210_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Extreme cold mode Exia, ready for launch."
c210_01_Field_Touch_1,I am Rudolph!
c210_01_Field_Go_1,"I want to try walking on all fours, but I guess that's a bit much."
c210_01_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging.
c210_01_Battle_Ready_1,You're getting a nightmare for Christmas.
c210_01_Battle_Ready_2,Are drop rates increased now?
c210_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's catch the event monster.
c210_01_Reload_1,It's annoying to reload in these gloves...
c210_01_Reload_2,Re-lo-ad!
c210_01_Reload_3,Keep smashing the R key.
c210_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Take this ultimate.
c210_01_Ult_Skill_1,Christmas edition malware code.
c210_01_FullBurst_1,Incoming!
c210_01_Kill_Monster_1,One grunt down.
c210_01_Kill_Monster_2,"Drop some items, will ya?"
c210_01_Kill_Monster_3,Bonus points!
c210_01_Damage_1,Yikes!
c210_01_Damage_2,My clothes!
c210_01_Damage_3,Hey!
c210_01_Die_1,Game over.
c210_01_Win_1,This Rudolph isn't just for show!
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"A hop and a skip, la la la...
Who will I meet on the way?"
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Aren't I cute as a button?
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"Rabbits jump like this, right? Boing, boing!"
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I wanna spend the whole day with you.
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'm off to a place where love reigns supreme!
Are you coming with me?"
c191_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Let's go eat some fluffy cotton candy together.
c191_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Rabbity? Where are you?
You said you'd take me to the Ark!"
c191_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I can't wait to spend more time with you!
So hop on over here, quick!"
c191_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Where do I want to go...? Anywhere, if it's with you!"
c191_01_Outpost_Touch_2,I wanna check out the toy store!
c191_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"I want to go for a walk in the park with you, hand in hand."
c191_01_Gacha_Get_1,Are we going to the Ark? Yippee!
c191_01_Reinforce_1,I wanna play here all day!
c191_01_Reinforce_2,"A hop and a skip, la la la..."
c191_01_Reinforce_3,Wowee! Thanks for sharing your strength with me!
c191_01_Gift_1,Is this a souvenir from the Ark? Thank you!
c191_01_Gift_2,A gift from Rabbity... I'll cherish it forever!
c191_01_Gift_3,"I want to get you a gift, too!
What do you want?"
c191_01_Attractive_Up_1,I want to be with you forever and ever.
c191_01_Attractive_Up_2,This is the happiest place in the world!
c191_01_Attractive_Up_3,"I think I'm starting to catch feelings for you, Rabbity."
c191_01_Party_Deploy_1,Can you tell me where we're going?
c191_01_Field_Touch_1,Are you calling me?
c191_01_Field_Go_1,Let's go together!
c191_01_Battle_Enter_1,Let's have fun together!
c191_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Ok, everybody! Let's do it!"
c191_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll show you what a rabbit can do!
c191_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's finish this quickly and go have some fun.
c191_01_Reload_1,"A-one, and a-two..."
c191_01_Reload_2,"Hehe, you can't see me!"
c191_01_Reload_3,"Just a moment, please..."
c191_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Rabbity!
c191_01_Ult_Skill_1,Off to the land of eternal happiness you go!
c191_01_FullBurst_1,Yahoo! I'm so happy!
c191_01_Kill_Monster_1,Did I do well?
c191_01_Kill_Monster_2,There's more where that came from.
c191_01_Kill_Monster_3,Hey! A compliment would be nice.
c191_01_Damage_1,Ow!
c191_01_Damage_2,Kyaa!
c191_01_Damage_3,*Sob*
c191_01_Die_1,Maybe we can just play together next time...
c191_01_Win_1,"All done! Now, are we gonna go have some fun or what?"
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"How do I look, Sweetie? I think I really pull this look off."
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Personally, I prefer cold hard cash over carrots."
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you have enough money, luck will follow."
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I prepared this outfit just for you!
Pretty sexy, don't you think?"
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I also learned how to pole dance! 
I can give you a show in private later☆"
c200_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Sweetie, do you like this outfit?
If you do, I've got plenty more just like it."
c200_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Sweetie, when are you coming?
What if I get abducted?"
c200_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Bunny Rupee hit the jackpot, E-I-E-I-O~
And dear old Sweetie is hers as well, E-I-E-I-O~"
c200_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Congratulations on finding the limited-edition Bunny Rupee!
Today is your lucky day!"
c200_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Come explore Coin Rush with me today!
c200_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"Why don't we play a round at Coin Rush?
The loser has to do whatever the winner asks them to."
c200_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Introducing the brand new, limited-edition Bunny Rupee ☆"
c200_01_Reinforce_1,"I've become stronger, so now I can spend more money!"
c200_01_Reinforce_2,Bunny powers... increase!
c200_01_Reinforce_3,I feel like I can take on the world!
c200_01_Gift_1,"Aw, thank you so much, Sweetie!"
c200_01_Gift_2,Is this the latest model? This is wonderful!
c200_01_Gift_3,Oh my gosh! I've got to show this off to the Shopaholics later!
c200_01_Attractive_Up_1,"At this rate, I'm gonna fall head over heels for you, Honeybuns."
c200_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I, Bunny Rupee, have finally found my companion!"
c200_01_Attractive_Up_3,Did I ever tell you how much I love you?
c200_01_Party_Deploy_1,I'm ready!
c200_01_Field_Touch_1,Lemme perk my ears up...
c200_01_Field_Go_1,"A hop, skip and a jump!"
c200_01_Battle_Enter_1,Bring it on!
c200_01_Battle_Ready_1,I'll show you what money can do!
c200_01_Battle_Ready_2,"When this is over, I'm going on a shopping spree."
c200_01_Battle_Ready_3,How much do these cost?
c200_01_Reload_1,Transferring funds...
c200_01_Reload_2,Hurry up!
c200_01_Reload_3,Wait!
c200_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Calculations complete!
c200_01_Ult_Skill_1,My treat today! Luxury bunny blast!
c200_01_FullBurst_1,"Great! Let's bring it home, girls!"
c200_01_Kill_Monster_1,Lucky!
c200_01_Kill_Monster_2,"OK, next!"
c200_01_Kill_Monster_3,Nice shot!
c200_01_Damage_1,Ouch!
c200_01_Damage_2,Ow!
c200_01_Damage_3,This is too much!
c200_01_Die_1,"*Sob* I'm sorry, Sweetie."
c200_01_Win_1,"Money talks, my non-bunny friends."
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Commander! It's summer! It's summer!
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_2,It's going to be a vitamin-filled summer!
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"The sea may be beautiful, but the sun can be very harmful. Be careful."
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Would you like to take some vitamins before going for a dip?
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,What do you think of my swimsuit?
c131_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Commander! Come talk to me if you're tired of swimming.
c131_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Where have you been, Commander? Did you go for a swim?"
c131_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Ah, this feels nice. I love working at the hospital, but it's nice to get out and have some fun once in a while."
c131_01_Outpost_Touch_1,We're going to set up a first aid station by the pool. Would you like to have a look?
c131_01_Outpost_Touch_2,How about a physical to celebrate the arrival of summer?
c131_01_Outpost_Touch_3,Isn't the sunshine wonderful? What a lovely day to swim in the sea.
c131_01_Gacha_Get_1,Let's strengthen our bodies and minds! This will be an awesome and healthy summer for all of us!
c131_01_Reinforce_1,Thanks! I think I just got healthier.
c131_01_Reinforce_2,"You're still so busy, even during the summer."
c131_01_Reinforce_3,"Thanks to you, Commander, I'll have a super healthy summer."
c131_01_Gift_1,"Oh my goodness, this is amazing!"
c131_01_Gift_2,"I'm always so touched by your gifts, Commander."
c131_01_Gift_3,"I'll repay you, I promise!"
c131_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Next time, I want to go to the sea with you alone...
If that's okay with you, heh-heh."
c131_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I don't know if it's the summer weather or you, but I'm feeling a bit emotional."
c131_01_Attractive_Up_3,"From now on, I want to be the vitamin that energizes and protects you. Can I?"
c131_01_Party_Deploy_1,Let's stick together while we're at the resort.
c131_01_Field_Touch_1,Let's make this fight cool and refreshing!
c131_01_Field_Go_1,Over there?
c131_01_Battle_Enter_1,Ah! Watch out!
c131_01_Battle_Ready_1,Don't get hurt before you go for a swim.
c131_01_Battle_Ready_2,The medic is right beside you!
c131_01_Battle_Ready_3,We won't let this heat get the best of us!
c131_01_Reload_1,I've gotta regroup and give it another go.
c131_01_Reload_2,This is a bit tougher than I expected.
c131_01_Reload_3,There's no rush.
c131_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Commander!
c131_01_Ult_Skill_1,Vitamins recharged! I can do it!
c131_01_FullBurst_1,It's time to go all out!
c131_01_Kill_Monster_1,Germs eliminated!
c131_01_Kill_Monster_2,Treatment complete!
c131_01_Kill_Monster_3,Wow!
c131_01_Damage_1,Gah!
c131_01_Damage_2,That hurt...
c131_01_Damage_3,Uh...
c131_01_Die_1,"Sorry, I may have gotten carried away since it's summer..."
c131_01_Win_1,Summertime victory!
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Mighty Tools is just as mighty by the seaside!
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Volt wears a life vest whenever we're near the ocean.
You should do the same, Greenhorn."
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_3,Who put fish in my toolbox?!
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Thanks to you, Greenhorn, I finally got to visit the ocean."
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Life is so unpredictable.
Who would have thought the day would come when I'd be wearing a swimsuit?"
c082_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Let's weave a net.
I'll catch you a netful of fish!"
c082_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Are you just going to stay on the shore and watch the water?
c082_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It's weird not having any work to do.
I guess this is what people mean when they say 'R&R'."
c082_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Is the swimming pool working properly?
Is there anything that needs repairing?"
c082_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"It's summer all right!
It's getting much warmer."
c082_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"It's much cooler here, compared to the ocean up on the surface."
c082_01_Gacha_Get_1,"If a cool summer is what you're after, let me know.
I can make anything."
c082_01_Reinforce_1,"Thanks for the pick-me-up! This way, I won't get heatstroke again."
c082_01_Reinforce_2,"I'm ready to go for a dip now, thanks."
c082_01_Reinforce_3,"Thanks for everything you're doing, Greenhorn. I know today's a real scorcher."
c082_01_Gift_1,A gift? ... Thank you.
c082_01_Gift_2,When did you find time to get these?
c082_01_Gift_3,"Thank you for the gift...
But don't just think about others. Take good care of yourself, too."
c082_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Greenhorn, let's be friends forever."
c082_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I think I'm starting to have feelings for you, Greenhorn.
Let's spend next summer together as well."
c082_01_Attractive_Up_3,This summer I've spent with you has been the best time of my life.
c082_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Are we going for a swim? Sure, let's go!"
c082_01_Field_Touch_1,Did you call me?
c082_01_Field_Go_1,Swimming sure can tucker you out.
c082_01_Battle_Enter_1,Hmm... I don't think this'll proceed terribly smoothly.
c082_01_Battle_Ready_1,"It doesn't matter how hot it gets, I'll always succeed."
c082_01_Battle_Ready_2,"Volt, finish this and hurry to the sea."
c082_01_Battle_Ready_3,I don't think I'll ever get used to fighting.
c082_01_Reload_1,"Aw jeez, Volt, you're all wet."
c082_01_Reload_2,Why do you keep licking my hands? Do they smell like fish?
c082_01_Reload_3,This scorching heat is making my memory fuzzy.
c082_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Greenhorn!
c082_01_Ult_Skill_1,Toward the sea! Woof-woof!
c082_01_FullBurst_1,"Let's have fun, guys!"
c082_01_Kill_Monster_1,Take this!
c082_01_Kill_Monster_2,It worked!
c082_01_Kill_Monster_3,I did it!
c082_01_Damage_1,Gah!
c082_01_Damage_2,Arrgh!
c082_01_Damage_3,Ouch.
c082_01_Die_1,I guess water and I just don't get along.
c082_01_Win_1,Volt! We won again!
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Today, I'm a race car driver!
... And a villain."
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Say, um... do you know anything about race car driving?
I don't, so I figured I'd ask."
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"The ultimate villain has to have her own wheels! 
... Paid in installments, of course."
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Push the pedal to the metal!
But don't forget to always obey traffic laws."
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I can lend you my car if you want, but don't you dare scuff it up."
c101_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Have you got a driver's license? You take the wheel, then.
I'm way too nervous to drive."
c101_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Where are you? Did you go to the race track without me?
c101_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'll be here cleaning the car until you get back.
c101_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Hmm,
there isn't any place for racing here."
c101_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Jeez, is there any place here at all where you can drive?"
c101_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"We should build a nice, long stretch of road here!
But if we can't, that's fine too I guess."
c101_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm coming to pick you up!
Heh-heh... Are you waiting for me?"
c101_01_Reinforce_1,I can drive faster now.
c101_01_Reinforce_2,Fire up your engines!
c101_01_Reinforce_3,"I've gotten stronger...
Wanna race?"
c101_01_Gift_1,"If you've got more, then hand it over. I can put it in my trunk...
Oh, wait, this car doesn't have a trunk..."
c101_01_Gift_2,"In return, I'll take you wherever you want to go."
c101_01_Gift_3,Another gift? Why?
c101_01_Attractive_Up_1,"You're doing well, and quickly approaching the finish line."
c101_01_Attractive_Up_2,You can ride shotgun.
c101_01_Attractive_Up_3,Don't be so aggressive!
c101_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Heh-heh, my turn."
c101_01_Field_Touch_1,Is the green light on?
c101_01_Field_Go_1,Go!
c101_01_Battle_Enter_1,I'll set my precious car to the side for now.
c101_01_Battle_Ready_1,Start your engines.
c101_01_Battle_Ready_2,"I'm the world's ultimate villain, and ultimate racer!"
c101_01_Battle_Ready_3,"Buckle up, buttercup!"
c101_01_Reload_1,"Don't rush!
Not unless it's urgent..."
c101_01_Reload_2,Push it into the redline!
c101_01_Reload_3,Faster than a car? Never!
c101_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Let's rock n' roll.
c101_01_Ult_Skill_1,Vroom vrooom vroom!
c101_01_FullBurst_1,I'm overtaking you!
c101_01_Kill_Monster_1,Nice kill.
c101_01_Kill_Monster_2,"Heh-heh, we took care of that quickly, didn't we?"
c101_01_Kill_Monster_3,Put it in the car.
c101_01_Damage_1,Don't scratch the paint!
c101_01_Damage_2,Ouch!
c101_01_Damage_3,Agh!
c101_01_Die_1,"I'm going back to my car...
but not to rest!"
c101_01_Win_1,All right! Let's take the car for a spin.
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Why is your clothing all so big, Commander?"
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Wow, the sleeves are so long! Like dangly bandages."
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"This doll is just like you, Commander.
I'll never let it out of my sight."
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I love your smell, Commander."
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Whenever I hug you tight, I fall fast asleep."
c260_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Wearing these clothes makes me feel like you're giving me a hug.
c260_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander? Where did you go? 
Can I try on more of your other clothes?"
c260_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Commander, where are you?
How do you do these buttons?"
c260_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Anis keeps saying that she thought I was a ghost,
but what does she mean?"
c260_01_Outpost_Touch_2,I am on a walk with Commander!
c260_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"Commander, the fridge is packed to the brim with Anis' sodas.
Let's go empty it out together."
c260_01_Gacha_Get_1,Your clothes smell of you. It's wonderful!
c260_01_Reinforce_1,Can I wear another piece of your clothing now?
c260_01_Reinforce_2,I've become stronger!
c260_01_Reinforce_3,I feel so powerful all of a sudden.
c260_01_Gift_1,Can I wear this too?
c260_01_Gift_2,"Wow, this has your smell on it too!"
c260_01_Gift_3,"You're supposed to say 'thank you' at a time like this, right? Thank you!"
c260_01_Attractive_Up_1,"I really like you, Commander, more than flour!"
c260_01_Attractive_Up_2,"You're the best, Commander. My love for you is bigger than these gigantic clothes."
c260_01_Attractive_Up_3,"You take up all the space in my heart, Commander!"
c260_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Can I wear your clothes on this mission, Commander?"
c260_01_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Commander!"
c260_01_Field_Go_1,Is this the right way?
c260_01_Battle_Enter_1,Scout!
c260_01_Battle_Ready_1,Can't get these clothes dirty.
c260_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll protect you.
c260_01_Battle_Ready_3,"Commander, be careful!"
c260_01_Reload_1,"Open up and say 'aaahhh', Commander!"
c260_01_Reload_2,Let's give you a little pat.
c260_01_Reload_3,"You're so cute, Commander."
c260_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Commander!
c260_01_Ult_Skill_1,I really... really like you!
c260_01_FullBurst_1,All together! Attack!
c260_01_Kill_Monster_1,... Good bye.
c260_01_Kill_Monster_2,"I did good, right?"
c260_01_Kill_Monster_3,"All right, you all are next!"
c260_01_Damage_1,Watch the clothes!
c260_01_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c260_01_Damage_3,Agh!
c260_01_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Commander, I got your clothes dirty..."
c260_01_Win_1,"After all that, I deserve a compliment."
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_1,What do you need?
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_2,What's the mission objective?
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_3,My overall condition is satisfactory.
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,How many of those Raptures are there in total?
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,So this so-called Ark is mankind's last line of defense?
c810_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Nikkes and androids share some similarities.
c810_02_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm undergoing maintenance.
c810_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Let me know if you need me.
I'm ready for anything."
c810_02_Outpost_Touch_1,This place seems so tranquil.
c810_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"As long as you perform regular cleaning and maintenance, bathing is unnecessary."
c810_02_Outpost_Touch_3,Are you the only male here?
c810_02_Gacha_Get_1,"YoRHa unit 2B, joining temporarily."
c810_02_Reinforce_1,Output increased.
c810_02_Reinforce_2,Body enhanced.
c810_02_Reinforce_3,No signs of rejection detected.
c810_02_Gift_1,What's this?
c810_02_Gift_2,What is the function of this?
c810_02_Gift_3,What exactly is this for?
c810_02_Attractive_Up_1,Thank you.
c810_02_Attractive_Up_2,Camaraderie confirmed.
c810_02_Attractive_Up_3,No hostility detected.
c810_02_Party_Deploy_1,We don't get to choose our assignments.
c810_02_Field_Touch_1,What is it?
c810_02_Field_Go_1,All right.
c810_02_Battle_Enter_1,Enemies sighted.
c810_02_Battle_Ready_1,You can count on me.
c810_02_Battle_Ready_2,I'll take care of it.
c810_02_Battle_Ready_3,Enemy units detected. Wipe them out.
c810_02_Reload_1,Back me up.
c810_02_Reload_2,I'll be back soon.
c810_02_Reload_3,Gotta regroup and rendezvous.
c810_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Preparation completed.
c810_02_Ult_Skill_1,You're wasting your time.
c810_02_FullBurst_1,Go!
c810_02_Kill_Monster_1,Target down.
c810_02_Kill_Monster_2,Enemies destroyed.
c810_02_Kill_Monster_3,Begone.
c810_02_Damage_1,Uh!
c810_02_Damage_2,Argh!
c810_02_Damage_3,*Groan*
c810_02_Die_1,Significant damage taken. Pull back.
c810_02_Win_1,All clear.
c321_Lobby_Touch_1,"As a teacher, it's important to understand your students."
c321_Lobby_Touch_2,"Did you have a question, Commander?"
c321_Lobby_Touch_3,"Once I'm finished grading these tests, I have to prepare for the communal assessments and arrange one-to-one interviews with the students... 
And then there's a demonstration class for a new subject."
c321_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you're going to school today, would you want to go together?"
c321_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Cat-shaped cherry cakes are all the rage right now. 
I'll have to try some so that I can keep up with the newest trends among my students."
c321_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Lovely Sweets Magazines...
Ah, I'm buying these just so I can better connect with my students."
c321_Lobby_Stay_1,I'll be marking the students' tests.
c321_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"... Commander, are you still busy?"
c321_Outpost_Touch_1,"As a teacher, I always welcome questions. 
If there is anything you're curious about, please ask."
c321_Outpost_Touch_2,"Commander?
I'm on my way to the library to gather some materials."
c321_Outpost_Touch_3,"Whenever I take a stroll here, it puts my mind at ease."
c321_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Marciana, and I teach at the M. M. R. vocational school.
I always do my best to provide the best learning experience for my students."
c321_Reinforce_1,I should be able to provide the students with better instruction.
c321_Reinforce_2,This is sure to cut down on the prep time necessary for class.
c321_Reinforce_3,I'll go prepare a new lesson plan.
c321_Gift_1,"Thank you, Commander."
c321_Gift_2,I always feel that this is improving the teaching experience I provide my students.
c321_Gift_3,"Is this for me? Thank you, Commander."
c321_Attractive_Up_1,I'm so thankful for everything you've done.
c321_Attractive_Up_2,"Thanks to you, I feel like my knowledge is expanding."
c321_Attractive_Up_3,Are you... planning on sticking around in the future?
c321_Party_Deploy_1,"Are you planning on attending class, Commander?"
c321_Field_Touch_1,I'm ready.
c321_Field_Go_1,On my way.
c321_Battle_Enter_1,Should I begin?
c321_Battle_Ready_1,It's time I bring this class to a close.
c321_Battle_Ready_2,This is an educational experience as well.
c321_Battle_Ready_3,It's time I teach all of you a lesson.
c321_Reload_1,Reloading.
c321_Reload_2,I have to do some quick maintenance.
c321_Reload_3,Give me just a second.
c321_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,We're ready for class.
c321_Ult_Skill_1,Time for class to begin.
c321_FullBurst_1,Pay attention in class!
c321_Kill_Monster_1,I've handled it.
c321_Kill_Monster_2,Well done.
c321_Kill_Monster_3,Class is over.
c321_Damage_1,Ugh...
c321_Damage_2,I'm okay.
c321_Damage_3,Hnrgh!
c321_Die_1,I'm sorry... I'll have to leave the rest to you.
c321_Win_1,I should start preparing for the next class.
c450_Lobby_Touch_1,"You think studying is all there is to being a student?
Oh, you have much to learn."
c450_Lobby_Touch_2,"Oh my, it's the day the accessory store is having a sale!"
c450_Lobby_Touch_3,I can't believe exams are already here. I hate this.
c450_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You're way different from the other teachers.
You treat us like actual students."
c450_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Sorry if Tia is getting on your nerves, Teacher.
You're such a good person."
c450_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Whenever I get tired of school, can I come and see you? I can keep it a secret."
c450_Lobby_Stay_1,Hmm... I should do some more studying on my own.
c450_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Are you busy?
There's something I'd like you to teach me."
c450_Outpost_Touch_1,"Tia forgot her bag this morning.
I've got to head to the school and pass it to her."
c450_Outpost_Touch_2,"Teacher! A bunch of new accessories just came out at the shopping mall.
Come with me to check them out."
c450_Outpost_Touch_3,I wish the school was this peaceful every day.
c450_Gacha_Get_1,"I can't wait to be in a graduating class together with you, Teacher. Hehe!"
c450_Reinforce_1,"Will you be giving us battle lessons in the future, too?"
c450_Reinforce_2,It's much more efficient when you teach us. Way better than school lessons.
c450_Reinforce_3,"I never thought I'd be able to make it this far. It's all thanks to you, Teacher."
c450_Gift_1,Is it okay for teachers to give presents to their students? Haha.
c450_Gift_2,"You picked out the exact gift I wanted!
This is perfect, Teacher, thank you!"
c450_Gift_3,I'm so happy that you got this for me! I promise I'll get you something one day.
c450_Attractive_Up_1,"For some reason, I feel so calm whenever I'm with you."
c450_Attractive_Up_2,"When you're around, I'm not even scared of exams anymore."
c450_Attractive_Up_3,Is there any chance I could come and see you privately today?
c450_Party_Deploy_1,"Teacher, what are we learning today?"
c450_Field_Touch_1,"Hehe, what's wrong, Teacher?"
c450_Field_Go_1,"I'll follow you closely, Teacher."
c450_Battle_Enter_1,A good student listens well.
c450_Battle_Ready_1,I can't believe I'm already about to graduate.
c450_Battle_Ready_2,"Don't get yourself hurt, Teacher."
c450_Battle_Ready_3,Time to show what a female student is capable of.
c450_Reload_1,This is pretty close to our practice drills.
c450_Reload_2,"Just a moment, gotta reload real quick."
c450_Reload_3,This uniform is so comfortable.
c450_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm already prepared, Teacher."
c450_Ult_Skill_1,I want to preserve beautiful memories of my campus life.
c450_FullBurst_1,Feast your eyes on what a student can do!
c450_Kill_Monster_1,Oh my!
c450_Kill_Monster_2,Haha.
c450_Kill_Monster_3,"Well, that was easy."
c450_Damage_1,Ow!
c450_Damage_2,Ugh!
c450_Damage_3,That hurts!
c450_Die_1,"Sorry, Teacher, I was overconfident. I'm gonna take a break."
c450_Win_1,Whew... That concludes today's lesson!
c451_Lobby_Touch_1,Where on earth did I put my reptile encyclopedia?
c451_Lobby_Touch_2,I could eat sweets all day long.
c451_Lobby_Touch_3,A chameleon's eyes look like a pair of lollipops. Isn't it adorable?
c451_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Teacher! What do you say we go eat some cake together?
c451_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,You won't believe what I dreamed about yesterday. A dragon!
c451_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You've got to promise to keep this a secret,
but... you give way better hugs than Naga♥"
c451_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm going to look at some pictures of lizards.
c451_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Teacher, how long do I have to wait?
Hurry up and play with me."
c451_Outpost_Touch_1,Whoa! Some new desserts just came out?
c451_Outpost_Touch_2,"I should be able to meet a dragon someday, don't you think?"
c451_Outpost_Touch_3,Think there are any lizards around here who are lost?
c451_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm happiest whenever I get to eat something sweet, hehe."
c451_Reinforce_1,Hmm? But I'm still not ready for graduation...
c451_Reinforce_2,"Thanks to you, I'm getting stronger every day."
c451_Reinforce_3,I feel like I've shed my old skin and been reborn. Thank you♥
c451_Gift_1,"You catch on quick, Teacher. I knew you would, hehe."
c451_Gift_2,This is just what I wanted! Thanks!
c451_Gift_3,My heart just skipped a beat♥
c451_Attractive_Up_1,"You're way cuter than a chameleon, Teacher."
c451_Attractive_Up_2,"It's weird. Whenever I see you around lately, my heart starts beating like crazy."
c451_Attractive_Up_3,"You're sweeter than any of the desserts around here, Teacher♥"
c451_Party_Deploy_1,When can we have a dessert?
c451_Field_Touch_1,Yes?
c451_Field_Go_1,Any iguanas over there?
c451_Battle_Enter_1,Maybe we'll meet up with a dragon!
c451_Battle_Ready_1,"Once we're done here, we'll finish the day with a piece of cake."
c451_Battle_Ready_2,Do you think I can see a dragon today?
c451_Battle_Ready_3,I wanna see a chameleon for myself.
c451_Reload_1,Reloading.
c451_Reload_2,Umph.
c451_Reload_3,"Done, nice and fast."
c451_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Huh? It's already full.
c451_Ult_Skill_1,Stay focused. Don't let your eyes wander♥
c451_FullBurst_1,Let's wrap this up. I'm hankering for something sweet.
c451_Kill_Monster_1,Wow!
c451_Kill_Monster_2,Clear!
c451_Kill_Monster_3,"Gotcha, hehe."
c451_Damage_1,Ow...
c451_Damage_2,*Sob*
c451_Damage_3,Stop!
c451_Die_1,"Aw man, I think I overdid it... I'll be more careful next time."
c451_Win_1,"Teacher, let's go have some dessert now♥"
c033_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hi, I'm Quiry! I'm supposed to be joining the A.C.P.U...
Wait, is this not where it is?"
c033_Lobby_Touch_2,"Hmm... is that you, Commander?"
c033_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm a Nikke but my eyesight isn't too great. 
Pretty weird, huh?"
c033_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I can see you as clear as day now, Commander!"
c033_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Now that I can see you better,
I feel like my surroundings are all a blur."
c033_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Having poor eyesight has its advantages.
It means that all I can see is you."
c033_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander? Are you there?
Where'd you go?"
c033_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"My world is all a haze when you're not here.
This is a recent development, though."
c033_Outpost_Touch_1,I've almost memorized the way to the Outpost.
c033_Outpost_Touch_2,"There are so many things in the world that look like Poli. 
... Especially towels."
c033_Outpost_Touch_3,Hmmm? What is this?
c033_Gacha_Get_1,Hmm... Is someone there?
c033_Reinforce_1,"Ohh! 
I feel like I can see a litttttle bit more in front of me!"
c033_Reinforce_2,This should let me help Poli out more.
c033_Reinforce_3,I've gotta keep doing my best!
c033_Gift_1,"Wow, thank you...
But what exactly is it?"
c033_Gift_2,"Wh-what is this?! 
It's got a funny shape..."
c033_Gift_3,"Thanks, I'll put it to good use!"
c033_Attractive_Up_1,"You're so dazzling, Commander!"
c033_Attractive_Up_2,"Hmmm... Did you get more clear,
or has the world gotten more blurry?"
c033_Attractive_Up_3,"I have the utmost respect for you, Commander. I honestly do."
c033_Party_Deploy_1,I'll try my best!
c033_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c033_Field_Go_1,Is this... the right way?
c033_Battle_Enter_1,I think I discovered a Rapture!
c033_Battle_Ready_1,Firing!
c033_Battle_Ready_2,"Everything in front of us are Raptures, right?"
c033_Battle_Ready_3,Where are the Raptures?
c033_Reload_1,Reloading!
c033_Reload_2,Preparing to reload.
c033_Reload_3,Was it this way?
c033_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I saw something sparkle!
c033_Ult_Skill_1,What a bunch of annoying bugs.
c033_FullBurst_1,I can see clearly now!
c033_Kill_Monster_1,Which way next?
c033_Kill_Monster_2,Did I kill it?
c033_Kill_Monster_3,Nice!
c033_Damage_1,Agh!
c033_Damage_2,Eeep!
c033_Damage_3,Keuk...!
c033_Die_1,I didn't see that Rapture on the left...
c033_Win_1,I could do this with my eyes closed.
c470_Lobby_Touch_1,"Got any plans?
Wanna listen to some music if you're free?"
c470_Lobby_Touch_2,"I may be into older things,
but that doesn't mean I'm an antique."
c470_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you've got nothing to do, at least come and massage my back."
c470_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Everything gets better with age.
Have you got any old objects lying around?"
c470_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'd love to hear any music recommendations you have.
c470_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Live long.
Being alive is a blessing."
c470_Lobby_Stay_1,Take your time. I'll be here listening to some tunes.
c470_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I don't mind being alone,
as long as it's not for too long."
c470_Outpost_Touch_1,"I like the Theater. 
I bet the acoustics in it must be amazing."
c470_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm a bit turned off by super modernized places like this.
It's a bit suffocating."
c470_Outpost_Touch_3,"Goddess of Victory, and Wings of Victory...
Haha, I must say I'm quite proud of this."
c470_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm a relic from a bygone era, so I'll be leaving soon.
But, until that happens, I'll do everything I can to help."
c470_Reinforce_1,"Whoa, amazing!"
c470_Reinforce_2,"Wow, I could have never imagined this happening in my time."
c470_Reinforce_3,So this is how you get stronger these days? So convenient.
c470_Gift_1,"What is this? You're not pulling a prank on me, are you?"
c470_Gift_2,"For me, it's all about the give and take. What kind of gift would you like?"
c470_Gift_3,Do you have any dirty mags?
c470_Attractive_Up_1,You're a good person. You should continue living like that.
c470_Attractive_Up_2,"If I were a little bit younger, you'd be in big trouble."
c470_Attractive_Up_3,Come here. Let's listen to music. We can split the earbuds.
c470_Party_Deploy_1,Red Hood! Engage!
c470_Field_Touch_1,Mhmm.
c470_Field_Go_1,"Come on, let's go!"
c470_Field_Go_2,Let's move out.
c470_Field_Go_3,Wanna hear some tunes while we proceed?
c470_Field_Go_4,Lovely weather we're having.
c470_Field_Go_5,Hmm... I'm a bit hungry.
c470_Battle_Enter_1,Are you ready? Then let's go.
c470_Battle_Ready_1,Get lost! I'm busy.
c470_Battle_Ready_2,You can leave this to me! Trust me!
c470_Battle_Ready_3,Today sure isn't your lucky day.
c470_Reload_1,Better reload.
c470_Reload_2,Why don't they develop something like an infinite magazine?
c470_Reload_3,"Oh no, I was just getting into the groove."
c470_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Wolfsbane, ready!"
c470_Ult_Skill_1,"Sorry to break it to you, but this is the end."
c470_Ult_Skill_2,Yeeahhhhhh!!
c470_Ult_Skill_3,One shot is all it takes.
c470_FullBurst_1,Let's keep the momentum going!
c470_Kill_Monster_1,Right!
c470_Kill_Monster_2,Good!
c470_Kill_Monster_3,That was simple enough.
c470_Damage_1,Touché.
c470_Damage_2,What the...?!
c470_Damage_3,Oh?
c470_Die_1,I'm sorry. I didn't keep my head in the game.
c470_Win_1,"Did you see that? I'm strong, but my comrades are stronger!"
c224_Lobby_Touch_1,"You're wondering if it's a heavy load?
Not at all. It's only 4 tons."
c224_Lobby_Touch_2,"I'm confident when it comes to making weapons,
but actually being in battle..."
c224_Lobby_Touch_3,"I still can't believe I'm a member of the Goddess Squad. 
I need to pull my weight."
c224_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Lilith is the best! 
She's strong, nice, cool, and... just the best!"
c224_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Nothing is greater than the Goddess Squad.
It's such an honor to be a part of it."
c224_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Red Hood...
Hehe. She is a good person."
c224_Lobby_Stay_1,Uh... Should I keep standing here?
c224_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Don't worry about me.
I'll be here working on more weapon designs."
c224_Outpost_Touch_1,I'd love to take the Lift one day.
c224_Outpost_Touch_2,"I adore snow-covered mountains.
I'm not even sure why, but I just do."
c224_Outpost_Touch_3,"There's no place in particular that I want to go.
The important thing is that you're there with me."
c224_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Snow White. 
I'm in charge of weapons development and maintenance."
c224_Reinforce_1,Output increase confirmed.
c224_Reinforce_2,"At this rate, am I closing in on Lilith?"
c224_Reinforce_3,"I like getting stronger.
It means I can better help those around me."
c224_Gift_1,"Wow, thank you! Really."
c224_Gift_2,"Is... 
Is it really okay if I accept this?"
c224_Gift_3,Thank you! I'll be sure to put it to good use.
c224_Attractive_Up_1,I'll be sure to work even harder going forward.
c224_Attractive_Up_2,I will act in a manner befitting the Goddess Squad.
c224_Attractive_Up_3,Is there any weapon in particular that you want? I could make it for you.
c224_Party_Deploy_1,Snow White. Engaging.
c224_Field_Touch_1,"Snow White, present."
c224_Field_Go_1,Proceeding to target.
c224_Field_Go_2,I'll move as quickly as I can.
c224_Field_Go_3,En route.
c224_Field_Go_4,Ughh... Hungry...
c224_Field_Go_5,On the move.
c224_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter!
c224_Battle_Ready_1,Uh... I'm anxious.
c224_Battle_Ready_2,E-enemy spotted!
c224_Battle_Ready_3,"Stay alive, everyone!"
c224_Reload_1,Re-reloading!
c224_Reload_2,Hu-hurry!
c224_Reload_3,Like this.
c224_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Seven Dwarves, ready!"
c224_Ult_Skill_1,I'll take it from here.
c224_Ult_Skill_2,Pi-pierce through them!
c224_Ult_Skill_3,All out!
c224_FullBurst_1,Everyone focus your fire!
c224_Kill_Monster_1,There we go!
c224_Kill_Monster_2,Did we get them?
c224_Kill_Monster_3,Excellent.
c224_Damage_1,Ugh!
c224_Damage_2,Argh!
c224_Damage_3,Lilith!
c224_Die_1,I'm sorry... I'll get out of everyone's hair.
c224_Win_1,The Goddess Squad is victorious once again!
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Now that I think of it, I've never shared a drink with you before."
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Let's raise our glasses.
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_3,Wouldn't you say I'm the most beautiful girl at this party?
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Would you like to have a drink?
You should know I never say such things, not to anyone."
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Even if this drink could have been spiked, you would still down it without a second thought, right?
That's why I like you."
c230_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You and I shall be the highlight of the party.
c230_01_Lobby_Stay_1,You made me wait. You'll have to make it up to me somehow.
c230_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Don't make me wait too long. 
Summoning me and then leaving me alone is a privilege granted only to you."
c230_01_Outpost_Touch_1,This is a rather... simple place.
c230_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Prepare a few locations that will suit me.
c230_01_Outpost_Touch_3,Do you not have a carriage for my use?
c230_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I know it's a lot to take in, but you must endure it."
c230_01_Reinforce_1,Seeing you work for me is quite pleasant.
c230_01_Reinforce_2,The gap between you and me will widen even further.
c230_01_Reinforce_3,I've become stronger.
c230_01_Gift_1,You truly do know what I enjoy. I'm most pleased.
c230_01_Gift_2,I'll reward you with more love and care.
c230_01_Gift_3,I wouldn't mind seeing this kind of charm more often.
c230_01_Attractive_Up_1,You may stand beside me. Come here.
c230_01_Attractive_Up_2,I'm beginning to like you more and more.
c230_01_Attractive_Up_3,How about having a party just for two next time?
c230_01_Party_Deploy_1,I'll cooperate just this once.
c230_01_Field_Touch_1,Did you call me?
c230_01_Field_Go_1,Don't rush me.
c230_01_Battle_Enter_1,You'll regret this.
c230_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Crows, it's mealtime."
c230_01_Battle_Ready_2,Such arrogance. Such insignificance.
c230_01_Battle_Ready_3,Seems like you have a death wish.
c230_01_Reload_1,Wait a minute.
c230_01_Reload_2,Reloading.
c230_01_Reload_3,This is taking longer than I expected.
c230_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,My crow thirsts for blood.
c230_01_Ult_Skill_1,Let's throw an executioner's ball.
c230_01_FullBurst_1,Struggle all you wish. You will die in agony.
c230_01_Kill_Monster_1,How pitiful.
c230_01_Kill_Monster_2,What's next?
c230_01_Kill_Monster_3,I would like to wrap this up.
c230_01_Damage_1,Ow!
c230_01_Damage_2,Ugh.
c230_01_Damage_3,*Cough*
c230_01_Die_1,"This is a special outfit, and I don't wish to see it ruined. I will stay out of this for the time being."
c230_01_Win_1,"There's no need to get excited.
Our victory was a foregone conclusion."
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Talking about the good old days never gets old.
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Even today's meeting will one day become a treasured memory.
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"We've really come a long way, haven't we?"
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It was a glorious time.
We were all together, and that was more than enough."
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Red Hood, Lilith.
Neither of you has met Pinne yet, have you? I'll introduce you."
c233_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Stay a bit longer. Have dessert. We have a lot of time.
c233_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Where did everyone go?
Get back before the tea gets cold."
c233_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It has been a while since we last met.
Tell me more about the others."
c233_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Sorry, but I have plans today."
c233_01_Outpost_Touch_2,It is about time for me to go to the party.
c233_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"The sun is so lovely up on the surface.
It's a waste being underground on a day like today."
c233_01_Gacha_Get_1,"The sun is shining so wonderfully today.
Pinne, should we invite everyone to a tea party?"
c233_01_Reinforce_1,I must protect the others.
c233_01_Reinforce_2,"As long as I am with all of you,
I can become stronger."
c233_01_Reinforce_3,Leave the battle to me.
c233_01_Gift_1,Thank you. I shall put it to good use.
c233_01_Gift_2,Oh my goodness... I think I'm going to cry.
c233_01_Gift_3,Is there anything I can do for you?
c233_01_Attractive_Up_1,"We'll always be together, right?"
c233_01_Attractive_Up_2,"Nothing lasts forever, but I get greedy sometimes."
c233_01_Attractive_Up_3,True happiness must be something like this.
c233_01_Party_Deploy_1,I shall take the lead.
c233_01_Field_Touch_1,Here.
c233_01_Field_Go_1,"Everyone, it's time to move."
c233_01_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c233_01_Battle_Ready_1,"If it's us, we can win."
c233_01_Battle_Ready_2,Don't push yourselves too hard.
c233_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's do this. For the future.
c233_01_Reload_1,Please cover me.
c233_01_Reload_2,I'm reloading.
c233_01_Reload_3,"Sorry, I'll get back to it soon."
c233_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,The light...
c233_01_Ult_Skill_1,May this time last forever.
c233_01_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, come with me!"
c233_01_Kill_Monster_1,Neutralized.
c233_01_Kill_Monster_2,Got you.
c233_01_Kill_Monster_3,Did you see that?
c233_01_Damage_1,Agh!
c233_01_Damage_2,Urgh.
c233_01_Damage_3,Hmph.
c233_01_Die_1,I must fall back. I will leave the rest to you all.
c233_01_Win_1,"I am glad we wrapped this up before the tea got cold.
Would you not agree, Pinne?"
c192_Lobby_Touch_1,"No matter how harsh your surroundings are,
there is always a way to survive."
c192_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you're ever in danger,
just let me know and I'll take care of it."
c192_Lobby_Touch_3,"I know it may not seem like it, but I'm a treasure trove of survival knowledge.
You can put your trust in me!"
c192_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I've learned that theory alone won't cut it.
I'll have to try even harder!"
c192_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you have some time, do you want to make some survival tools with me?"
c192_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"My squadmates are really amazing.
I'm sure I'll measure up to them in time."
c192_Lobby_Stay_1,"Survivalist. Survivalist?
You're not lost somewhere, are you?"
c192_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm not sure where you are,
but I'll find you, promise."
c192_Outpost_Touch_1,Hmmm... I'm not too confident about surviving in the city.
c192_Outpost_Touch_2,You should really check out some clothing stores. They have all sorts of outfits perfect for every kind of survival situation.
c192_Outpost_Touch_3,Let's see... a good place to hide during emergencies is...
c192_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Tove, the new Unlimited recruit! Anything survival-related is my specialty."
c192_Reinforce_1,Hehe. My survival skills have improved.
c192_Reinforce_2,I'll overcome any challenges that come my way.
c192_Reinforce_3,I'm getting to be more like my squadmates!
c192_Gift_1,"There aren't bugs in here, are there? I mean, of course I'll eat them, but..."
c192_Gift_2,Thank you! This will make a perfect survival tool.
c192_Gift_3,Oooh! I'll have so many uses for this!
c192_Attractive_Up_1,"Um... Survivalist. Whenever you feel lonely or in danger, please let me know, okay?"
c192_Attractive_Up_2,"Would you ever want to join me on a camping trip sometime?
O-of course I understand if you're busy."
c192_Attractive_Up_3,"I'll tough it out in any environment if it means rescuing you, Survivalist."
c192_Party_Deploy_1,I'll make sure everyone here survives.
c192_Field_Touch_1,Survival conditions still optimal.
c192_Field_Go_1,I'll lead you to a safe route.
c192_Battle_Enter_1,This is an emergency!
c192_Battle_Ready_1,"Raptures are excellent sources of protein... wait, that's not right."
c192_Battle_Ready_2,Those who survive are the victors.
c192_Battle_Ready_3,We will survive!
c192_Reload_1,Just hold on a bit longer!
c192_Reload_2,Recharging survival power!
c192_Reload_3,Just like in the manual.
c192_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,The will to survive... can you feel it?
c192_Ult_Skill_1,The burning passion! The fiery will!
c192_FullBurst_1,All of us will return alive and kicking!
c192_Kill_Monster_1,That actually worked?
c192_Kill_Monster_2,Did you see that?!
c192_Kill_Monster_3,N-nice!
c192_Damage_1,Ow!
c192_Damage_2,Argh!
c192_Damage_3,I-is this it?
c192_Die_1,"If I fail now, I'll never be able to face my squadmates."
c192_Win_1,We did it! We survived!
c194_Lobby_Touch_1,"If you ever need anything while you're at Snowfield,
give me a ring anytime."
c194_Lobby_Touch_2,"I dressed in what I felt would be appropriate for the owner of a hot spring.
What do you think? Does it suit me?"
c194_Lobby_Touch_3,Have a nice time in the hot spring.
c194_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you're not busy,
would you like to take a walk around Snowfield?"
c194_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Whenever I'm with you,
it feels like time passes so quickly."
c194_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You want to go in the hot spring with me?
... I'll think about it."
c194_Lobby_Stay_1,I should go and see how things are going at Snowfield.
c194_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"When are you coming to Snowfield?
I'd love to have tea with you and enjoy the scenery."
c194_Outpost_Touch_1,"Snowfield is always open, so you're welcome anytime."
c194_Outpost_Touch_2,"Do you know where I can buy bath salts?
I was thinking of adding some to the hot springs."
c194_Outpost_Touch_3,Would you like to come to Snowfield with me?
c194_Gacha_Get_1,"Even with snow all around you, this is a place where you can cozy up and get warm.
Welcome to Snowfield Hot Spring."
c194_Reinforce_1,I think I can work a bit harder.
c194_Reinforce_2,I'm always filled with a sense of gratitude.
c194_Reinforce_3,You always know when I need a pick-me-up.
c194_Gift_1,You got this for me?
c194_Gift_2,I can show this off at Snowfield.
c194_Gift_3,"I should be the one giving you gifts, and yet here I am receiving them from you. 
Thanks."
c194_Attractive_Up_1,Don't forget that I'm always thinking of you.
c194_Attractive_Up_2,"Wherever you are, I will always find you."
c194_Attractive_Up_3,... I haven't felt this in a long time.
c194_Party_Deploy_1,I've already prepared.
c194_Field_Touch_1,"As long as I'm here,
you don't have to worry about getting lost."
c194_Field_Go_1,I'll show you the way.
c194_Battle_Enter_1,I'll take the lead.
c194_Battle_Ready_1,Follow me.
c194_Battle_Ready_2,"Don't get yourself injured, Servant."
c194_Battle_Ready_3,Let's hurry and get this done and head back to Snowfield.
c194_Reload_1,Just a moment.
c194_Reload_2,Reloading.
c194_Reload_3,Don't rush me.
c194_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Hehe, should we start?"
c194_Ult_Skill_1,"When you're lost, look to this lantern."
c194_FullBurst_1,I will light up the way.
c194_Kill_Monster_1,Why don't we display this at Snowfield?
c194_Kill_Monster_2,This is nothing.
c194_Kill_Monster_3,Easy pickings.
c194_Damage_1,Ow!
c194_Damage_2,Urgh...
c194_Damage_3,That hurts.
c194_Die_1,I don't think I'll be able to make it to the hot spring today.
c194_Win_1,Let's head to the hot spring and take a load off.
c062_Lobby_Touch_1,"I wanna be a grown-up, just like Ludmilla."
c062_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you need anything from Snowfield, just let me know."
c062_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm not so sure what you mean by ""Merry Christmas""."
c062_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hehe, this is the first time I've worn something this pretty.
I really love it!"
c062_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Since I have you and Belorta,
I'm sure this is gonna be a wonderful Christmas."
c062_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'd love to take a walk with you at Snowfield...
Gah! Erm... pretend you didn't hear that."
c062_Lobby_Stay_1,"Sorry, but I've got a lot of things to take care of at Snowfield. Could I be excused?"
c062_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll wait here for you until you get here, so take your time."
c062_Outpost_Touch_1,Be sure to come and visit Snowfield whenever you've got a chance!
c062_Outpost_Touch_2,Oh no... I was running an errand and I got lost!
c062_Outpost_Touch_3,"Old-Timer,
have you seen Belorta or Ludmilla?"
c062_Gacha_Get_1,"Even with snow all around you, this is a place where you can cozy up and get warm. Welcome to Snowfield Hot Spring.
Does that sound okay...?"
c062_Reinforce_1,"With this much strength, I feel like I can protect everyone!"
c062_Reinforce_2,"I'll do my best, Old-Timer!"
c062_Reinforce_3,Thank you for helping me!
c062_Gift_1,"Oh my goodness, thank you!
I'll treasure this forever."
c062_Gift_2,Wow... Is this a Christmas gift?
c062_Gift_3,"Oooh, I'll put this on display at Snowfield!"
c062_Attractive_Up_1,Is this how it feels to like someone?
c062_Attractive_Up_2,I always feel so at ease when I'm with you.
c062_Attractive_Up_3,"Belorta is the best... but I also like you, Old-Timer... and Ludmilla is great too...
Ohh, I can't choose!"
c062_Party_Deploy_1,Oh... can I really do this?
c062_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c062_Field_Go_1,Am I going the right way?
c062_Battle_Enter_1,Ah! Encounter!
c062_Battle_Ready_1,Let's finish this fast so we can have a party!
c062_Battle_Ready_2,"I'll protect you, Old-Timer!"
c062_Battle_Ready_3,Uhh... There are too many of them!
c062_Reload_1,Wait!
c062_Reload_2,"C'mon, faster..."
c062_Reload_3,Reloading!
c062_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Let's get started, shall we?"
c062_Ult_Skill_1,"Leave Snowfield Hot Spring to me!
... Squeaky clean now!"
c062_FullBurst_1,Everyone can have a blast at Snowfield Hot Spring.
c062_Kill_Monster_1,I did it!
c062_Kill_Monster_2,"Did you see that, Old-Timer?"
c062_Kill_Monster_3,Whoa!
c062_Damage_1,Ah!
c062_Damage_2,That hurt...
c062_Damage_3,Argh!
c062_Die_1,I think I'm gonna go take a rest.
c062_Win_1,Old-Timer! Let's hurry back to Snowfield! Hehe.
c225_Lobby_Touch_1,"Nothing is eternal.
That is the only unchanging truth in this world."
c225_Lobby_Touch_2,"Thou should not get too close,
lest by some mischance I hurt thee."
c225_Lobby_Touch_3,Thou art most welcome to spar with me at any time.
c225_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Fleeting as time may be,
I cannot see an end in sight for me."
c225_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"The Goddess Squad has many capable hands.
'Tis its most preeminent aspect."
c225_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I shall become stronger and not be at the mercy of anyone.
Failure is not an option."
c225_Lobby_Stay_1,"Follow the wind... the clouds... and your heart...
Heh-heh, 'tis but impossible."
c225_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"There are many things to fight for in this vast world.
Rose, is it also a way to progress through this life?"
c225_Outpost_Touch_1,"Where is Lilith?
I crave a good tussle."
c225_Outpost_Touch_2,"I am in search of a place to train.
Pray tell, dost thou have anything in mind?"
c225_Outpost_Touch_3,"Where does my heart take me...?
I desire to go where the strongest personalities congregate."
c225_Gacha_Get_1,"I am a sword which renders Raptures asunder.
Do not wield me capriciously, for even my handle has a sharp edge."
c225_Reinforce_1,I desire to be strong enough to cleave anything in half.
c225_Reinforce_2,Now I can fell stronger opponents!
c225_Reinforce_3,Fleetly Fading is more honed than ever.
c225_Gift_1,"Thank you so much,
this is precisely what I require."
c225_Gift_2,"This gift... is out of sheer goodwill?
Can such a notion truly exist in this world?"
c225_Gift_3,"Thanks.
Let me know if you need anything in return."
c225_Attractive_Up_1,"Please, keep thy distance.
No good will come of us getting too close."
c225_Attractive_Up_2,"Should you desire for something to be cleaved in half,
I am at your command."
c225_Attractive_Up_3,Someone who is this close to me... apart from Rose?
c225_Party_Deploy_1,I consider it a blessing to fight alongside you. Let us be on our way.
c225_Field_Touch_1,Tell me what you want.
c225_Field_Go_1,Let's go.
c225_Battle_Enter_1,"A fight then, is it?"
c225_Battle_Ready_1,I will destroy everything that's in my way.
c225_Battle_Ready_2,Whew... have at you.
c225_Battle_Ready_3,If only there were a worthy opponent.
c225_Reload_1,You're a rather tenacious foe.
c225_Reload_2,Need a sharper sword...
c225_Reload_3,I'm on my way.
c225_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c225_Ult_Skill_1,"Fleetly Fading, strike!"
c225_FullBurst_1,Mine blade shall render all asunder.
c225_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c225_Kill_Monster_2,But a mere bagatelle.
c225_Kill_Monster_3,Is that all?
c225_Damage_1,Wha...?
c225_Damage_2,Ugh.
c225_Damage_3,Ow!
c225_Die_1,Ha-ha... This is not what I expected...
c225_Win_1,"A commendable battle, but I desire stronger opponents next time."
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Pit Boss!
Do you think this dress suits me?"
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Noir and I are going to take a bath in the hot spring.
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_3,New clothes... New hairstyle... I like it!
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I could stay here with you forever.
Oh, and Noir, too!"
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I am so happy that I get to spend Christmas with you, Pit Boss.
This Christmas is gonna be the luckiest ever!"
c270_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Emma taught me how to give massages.
Maybe I can give you one later?"
c270_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you going to be here soon?
If not, can I go hang out with Noir for a while?"
c270_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hurry up and get here, Pit Boss!
You, me, and Noir all need to take a soak in the hot spring."
c270_01_Outpost_Touch_1,Noir and I are going to Snowfield. Would you like to join us?
c270_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"What I wouldn't give to go back to Snowfield again...
When do you think we'll get another chance?"
c270_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"Everybody is looking at me...
Maybe because I'm wearing something other than my bunny girl suit?"
c270_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Blanc, the lucky white bunny!
Would you like to join me in the lucky hot spring?"
c270_01_Reinforce_1,"I feel like I'm full of luck!
Maybe it's because I am wearing a new suit."
c270_01_Reinforce_2,I'm gonna turn Snowfield Hot Spring into a place bursting with luck.
c270_01_Reinforce_3,"Luck energy, recharged!"
c270_01_Gift_1,Is this a Christmas gift?
c270_01_Gift_2,"Wow! Thank you, Pit Boss!
I'll take it with me every day at Snowfield."
c270_01_Gift_3,"Whoa... Is this really for me?
I'll give you something too when I return to Coin Rush."
c270_01_Attractive_Up_1,"I think the reason I like Snowfield so much is...
because I can be with you all the time, Pit Boss."
c270_01_Attractive_Up_2,I'll never change the way I feel about you.
c270_01_Attractive_Up_3,"After Noir, you're the person I cherish most, Pit Boss."
c270_01_Party_Deploy_1,Leave it to me!
c270_01_Field_Touch_1,Do you need me to share some luck with you?
c270_01_Field_Go_1,"Ugh...
Moving isn't so easy without my bunny suit…"
c270_01_Battle_Enter_1,Misfortune has found us!
c270_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Don't get hurt, Pit Boss!"
c270_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll protect you!
c270_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's finish this battle then back to Snowfield Hot Spring!
c270_01_Reload_1,Reloading!
c270_01_Reload_2,"Ugh, this clothing is so cumbersome."
c270_01_Reload_3,I'm going as fast as I can.
c270_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Pit Boss, now's the time!"
c270_01_Ult_Skill_1,Lady Luck is always on our side!
c270_01_FullBurst_1,Luck is reserved for those who are prepared!
c270_01_Kill_Monster_1,One and done!
c270_01_Kill_Monster_2,Easy peasy!
c270_01_Kill_Monster_3,Nice!
c270_01_Damage_1,Ooof!
c270_01_Damage_2,Ow...
c270_01_Damage_3,Agh!
c270_01_Die_1,"Pit Boss,
Noir and I have to go back to Coin Rush..."
c270_01_Win_1,Now it's hot spring time!
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey, check it out!
Volt and I have matching outfits."
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"You told me to wear something formal...
but why do I look like a child? I'm not into this at all."
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"No matter what I wear,
it won't tarnish Mighty Tools' impeccable reputation."
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Sunflowers remind me of Volt, so I like them.
Actually... they're a bit like you, too."
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You say I look like a kindergartener?
You take that back!"
c082_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I never thought that one day I would dress like this.
I must have lived too long."
c082_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'll leave you to your work then.
I told Centi she should come see Volt's new outfit."
c082_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I wanna go play with Volt while I'm wearing a cute outfit.
I'll be back when you're free."
c082_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"Volt, do you want to go on a walk with the new clothes?"
c082_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"Wearing this to the Workshop may be a bit...
What do you think, Greenhorn?"
c082_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Is there a kindergarten in the Outpost? Of course not. 
... Why do you ask?"
c082_02_Gacha_Get_1,"Dressing like this is a bit embarrassing,
but doesn't it match perfectly with Volt?"
c082_02_Reinforce_1,Thank you for looking after me.
c082_02_Reinforce_2,I think I've got the strength to hold on a little longer now.
c082_02_Reinforce_3,"Thanks to you, Greenhorn, I can have some fun for once."
c082_02_Gift_1,You're always sending me such wonderful gifts. Thank you so much.
c082_02_Gift_2,"Another gift?
What if I were to tell you I want even more?"
c082_02_Gift_3,"Is it just me, or do I get the impression that you're giving presents to a small child?"
c082_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Greenhorn, I'm making a Volt badge for you.
I'll give it to you next time we see each other."
c082_02_Attractive_Up_2,"I wish you'll lead a long, long life.
That way, I can see you more."
c082_02_Attractive_Up_3,"The more I think about it, the more I'm into you."
c082_02_Party_Deploy_1,You want me to fight in this outfit?
c082_02_Field_Touch_1,Go ahead.
c082_02_Field_Go_1,There's no way I can run in this thing.
c082_02_Battle_Enter_1,This isn't going smoothly at all!
c082_02_Battle_Ready_1,Let's get this over with and hurry back.
c082_02_Battle_Ready_2,"A new outfit for a new fight! Go get 'em, Volt!"
c082_02_Battle_Ready_3,Another battle? I just finished dressing up.
c082_02_Reload_1,"Stop licking me, Volt! I'm not even wearing a helmet…"
c082_02_Reload_2,Why are you so obsessed with licking my hair?
c082_02_Reload_3,Fighting is tougher. I must be getting old.
c082_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Volt!
c082_02_Ult_Skill_1,Woo-hoo!! Let's have a party!
c082_02_FullBurst_1,Now! Everyone!
c082_02_Kill_Monster_1,Let's do it again!
c082_02_Kill_Monster_2,Did I catch it?
c082_02_Kill_Monster_3,Yeah!
c082_02_Damage_1,Oof!
c082_02_Damage_2,Argh!
c082_02_Damage_3,You tore my outfit!
c082_02_Die_1,Fighting dressed up like this is impossible.
c082_02_Win_1,How do you like that? A grand victory!
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"Producer, ready to watch my show?"
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"Whoo boy... I'm as prepared as I'll ever be,
but I'm still nervous at the thought of having a concert."
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'll need your support more than ever today, Producer."
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hard work pays off.
This concert is going to be a huge success."
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"No matter what stage I get on,
I'm not afraid as long as I'm with you."
c430_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Today's concert is for you, Producer.
So be sure to come!"
c430_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"Um… can I make a move first?
I need to go prepare for a show."
c430_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Whenever you're around, I feel secure,
like everything will go smoothly."
c430_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"I want to do a concert rehearsal in the theater...
Would you like to come?"
c430_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"You always manage to find me no matter where I am.
I like that."
c430_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"I do miss the times when I was practicing in the Outpost.
After all, it made me who I am today."
c430_02_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm thrilled to be on a bigger stage.
Please do come to my show, Producer."
c430_02_Reinforce_1,I take it this is so I can work even harder?
c430_02_Reinforce_2,Thanks for the vote of confidence.
c430_02_Reinforce_3,I think my abilities just went up an octave.
c430_02_Gift_1,I'll prepare a gift for you next time.
c430_02_Gift_2,"When did you even have time to get this?
Thank you so much."
c430_02_Gift_3,"How did you...
I've wanted this for a while now... thanks."
c430_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Although I'm more confident than ever,
I think I still need you around."
c430_02_Attractive_Up_2,"One day, I will make your heart flutter whenever you listen to my songs."
c430_02_Attractive_Up_3,"I wouldn't be who I am without you. 
Thank you."
c430_02_Party_Deploy_1,I'm ready. Let's go.
c430_02_Field_Touch_1,Go ahead.
c430_02_Field_Go_1,"Yes. Over there, right?"
c430_02_Battle_Enter_1,Let the show begin.
c430_02_Battle_Ready_1,Let's enjoy the show.
c430_02_Battle_Ready_2,"With you around, I can do this easy-peasy."
c430_02_Battle_Ready_3,Let's put on a nice show for our audience.
c430_02_Reload_1,"Hah... Don't worry, I'm okay."
c430_02_Reload_2,I can do it. I'll try harder!
c430_02_Reload_3,Let's regroup and try again.
c430_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Producer!
c430_02_Ult_Skill_1,I've prepared a special song just for you!
c430_02_FullBurst_1,"Come on, everybody. Sing your hearts out!"
c430_02_Kill_Monster_1,Next!
c430_02_Kill_Monster_2,Feeling good!
c430_02_Kill_Monster_3,Shall we continue?
c430_02_Damage_1,Ow!
c430_02_Damage_2,Hold on...
c430_02_Damage_3,Argh!
c430_02_Die_1,The show... must go on...
c430_02_Win_1,Another successful show!
c382_Lobby_Touch_1,"Oh Timi, you're such a cutie!"
c382_Lobby_Touch_2,"I wish people would't judge Timi based solely on his appearance.
He's actually very kind."
c382_Lobby_Touch_3,"I've always fed large animals,
so whenever I touch small animals, I'm afraid that I'll end up hurting them."
c382_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Here's a kiss for you, Timi!
Would you like a kiss too, Zoo Keeper?"
c382_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I like everything to be king-sized,
whether it's animals or you, Zoo Keeper, hehe."
c382_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I want to be alone with you,
so I won't bring Timi with me next time."
c382_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you tired of waiting, Timi?
I'll play with you later."
c382_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Are you eager to see Zoo Keeper, Timi?
Me too."
c382_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place is nice and quiet.
Perfect for walking Timi."
c382_Outpost_Touch_2,"I don't suppose they've got any shops here that cater to big cats, do they?"
c382_Outpost_Touch_3,I hope Timi's appearance doesn't scare anyone.
c382_Gacha_Get_1,"Hello there, my name is Leona, and this cute lion here is Timi."
c382_Reinforce_1,"You have hopes of me becoming better at my job, right? I'll try my best, I promise."
c382_Reinforce_2,I feel like my body has become lighter. Thanks!
c382_Reinforce_3,I'm more skilled now.
c382_Gift_1,"Wow, thanks! I'll put it to good use."
c382_Gift_2,"Timi seems to like it too, haha."
c382_Gift_3,I'm not used to getting gifts all the time.
c382_Attractive_Up_1,It would be nice if you could be there for me like Timi has.
c382_Attractive_Up_2,"What should I do? I'm growing more and more fond of you, Zoo Keeper.
Timi might get jealous..."
c382_Attractive_Up_3,Oh boy... my heart is beating faster than the last time I saw a brown bear out in the wild.
c382_Party_Deploy_1,"Off I go, Timi."
c382_Field_Touch_1,Roar!
c382_Field_Go_1,On my way.
c382_Battle_Enter_1,You fools dare stand in the way of a lion?
c382_Battle_Ready_1,Looks like we've got some naughty kids who need taking care of.
c382_Battle_Ready_2,Let the training begin!
c382_Battle_Ready_3,You're all worse than beasts.
c382_Reload_1,Replenishing ammo.
c382_Reload_2,Give me a second.
c382_Reload_3,Can you keep an eye out for me?
c382_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c382_Ult_Skill_1,Who wants some treats? Come over here!
c382_FullBurst_1,Bite at will!
c382_Kill_Monster_1,Gotcha.
c382_Kill_Monster_2,How was that? Am I doing good?
c382_Kill_Monster_3,There are still so many.
c382_Damage_1,Ouch!
c382_Damage_2,*Whimper*
c382_Damage_3,Ugh...!
c382_Die_1,"Sorry, but I'm standing down."
c382_Win_1,Never tread on the lion's tail.
c281_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hello, Cadet.
Let's be good friends."
c281_Lobby_Touch_2,Faithfulness is the most important quality of a knight-errant.
c281_Lobby_Touch_3,The Peony Association never engages in immoral acts.
c281_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Would you like to join my organization?
You're always welcome."
c281_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you're ever having any difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out.
I can help."
c281_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I will be with you forever,
that I can promise you."
c281_Lobby_Stay_1,Cadet! Where are you?
c281_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll never abandon you, no matter what happens."
c281_Outpost_Touch_1,"Are you calling for me, Cadet?
What's the matter?"
c281_Outpost_Touch_2,"What a lovely place!
I ought to bring my subordinates here for a tour later."
c281_Outpost_Touch_3,"You want to show me around?
Okay!"
c281_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Moran, the leader of the Peony Association.
Starting from today, you are my Cadet."
c281_Reinforce_1,Anyone who messes with you will have to answer to me.
c281_Reinforce_2,Oh! I feel stronger!
c281_Reinforce_3,Your safety is my top priority.
c281_Gift_1,"Huh? Is this for me?
Er... Thank you!"
c281_Gift_2,"Your generosity makes me feel a bit embarrassed.
What could I possibly give in return?"
c281_Gift_3,"Where did you get something so nice? 
Thanks so much."
c281_Attractive_Up_1,Are you trying to suck up to me?
c281_Attractive_Up_2,"My heart is always beating whenever you're around.
Then again, I suppose that's what a heart is supposed to do."
c281_Attractive_Up_3,"Thank you for trusting me.
I'll make sure it does not go misplaced."
c281_Party_Deploy_1,Leave it to me!
c281_Field_Touch_1,Let's go!
c281_Field_Go_1,Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!
c281_Battle_Enter_1,Let's show them how powerful we are!
c281_Battle_Ready_1,"Let's go, guys!"
c281_Battle_Ready_2,Stay safe. Don't die out there!
c281_Battle_Ready_3,I will knock them all down.
c281_Reload_1,Wait a moment!
c281_Reload_2,"Don't give up, everyone!"
c281_Reload_3,I'll be back soon!
c281_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Shall we?
c281_Ult_Skill_1,That's it? Bring forth your full strength!
c281_FullBurst_1,Trust me and follow my lead!
c281_Kill_Monster_1,This is fun!
c281_Kill_Monster_2,Aren't I the best?
c281_Kill_Monster_3,"Haha, did you see that?"
c281_Damage_1,Ugh!
c281_Damage_2,Agh!
c281_Damage_3,Ah!
c281_Die_1,I'm sorry... I wasn't able to protect you.
c281_Win_1,Did you see me out there? I did great!
c313_Lobby_Touch_1,With this magic spell... this dish will become more tasty... hyah!
c313_Lobby_Touch_2,"Don't be mistaken.
Just because I'm wearing this outfit doesn't mean I'm a real maid."
c313_Lobby_Touch_3,Or-order your meal somewhere else!
c313_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,W-would you like some coochie woochie omurice...?
c313_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Wh-what would you like to eat,
Master?"
c313_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I can't let the others see me like this.
You're the only exception I'll make."
c313_Lobby_Stay_1,"Master? Where did you go?
I have lots of things to do, you know."
c313_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Since I'm your maid, I'll wait for you here.
Please come back soon."
c313_Outpost_Touch_1,"What are you doing?
I didn't choose to dress up like this!"
c313_Outpost_Touch_2,"The Maid Cafe is holding an event,
so come and join us if you have time."
c313_Outpost_Touch_3,"Coochie woochie, boing boing...
Ah! You didn't hear that, did you?"
c313_Gacha_Get_1,"My name is Privaty, and I am your maid..."
c313_Reinforce_1,I'll repay you by making some extra tasty omurice.
c313_Reinforce_2,Are you planning on keeping me as a maid 24/7?
c313_Reinforce_3,Well... I guess being a maid isn't too bad.
c313_Gift_1,"Huh? A Master trying to please a maid?
Anyway, I'll take it for now..."
c313_Gift_2,Don't you think you're a bit obsessed with me?
c313_Gift_3,"You really know what I like, Master."
c313_Attractive_Up_1,"What do you think happens if a maid falls in love with someone she's serving?
Ugh... Just asking!"
c313_Attractive_Up_2,"Next time,
I'll use the ketchup to draw a heart on your omurice."
c313_Attractive_Up_3,I'm starting to get used to calling you Master.
c313_Party_Deploy_1,Did you select me?
c313_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, M-Master."
c313_Field_Go_1,I'm going in!
c313_Battle_Enter_1,Is this the sort of thing a maid should be doing?
c313_Battle_Ready_1,"I just need to clean this place up, right?!"
c313_Battle_Ready_2,Let's clean up this mess and go back!
c313_Battle_Ready_3,Phew... that's a lot of trash to take out.
c313_Reload_1,I'm reloading.
c313_Reload_2,"Come on, faster!"
c313_Reload_3,What am I doing here?
c313_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,M-Master!
c313_Ult_Skill_1,"B-become tastier♪ Coochie woochie, boing!"
c313_FullBurst_1,"Wrap it up, now!"
c313_Kill_Monster_1,That wasn't such a big deal after all.
c313_Kill_Monster_2,Who's next?
c313_Kill_Monster_3,All cleaned up!
c313_Damage_1,Ouch!
c313_Damage_2,Ow!
c313_Damage_3,Eeep!
c313_Die_1,"I've got to pull back... I'm sorry, Master..."
c313_Win_1,"For a maid, this was a piece of cake."
c500_Lobby_Touch_1,"What are you up to today? Getting in a good BOOM session, I bet."
c500_Lobby_Touch_2,Do you have any faulty equipment that needs some fixing?
c500_Lobby_Touch_3,"As long as I can play some BOOM, I could live up on the surface by myself forever."
c500_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hehe, nothing gets the point across better than the Boomstick!"
c500_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This game has all the emotional highs and lows you'd ever need, all in just 28 megabytes."
c500_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,My dream is to install BOOM on every type of electronic device in the world.
c500_Lobby_Stay_1,"You can leave me on my own, it's fine...
I'll just be here playing some BOOM..."
c500_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"How far along is the BOOM installation... 10%... 20%... Huh? What am I doing?
Nothing much. You can come back later."
c500_Outpost_Touch_1,"Hot diggity dog, just the sight of this train is enough to get my blood pumping!
All aboard the train to the Outpost!"
c500_Outpost_Touch_2,"If Ms. Syuen comes around, just say you haven't seen me.
I installed BOOM on her cellphone, and she wasn't too pleased."
c500_Outpost_Touch_3,"Why does that elevator break down every day?
Could it be a power shortage? I'll have to look into it."
c500_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Elegg, and I'm a 12 outta 10!"
c500_Reinforce_1,This upgrade seems to be a success!
c500_Reinforce_2,"Hehe, I feel like I just got in a rousing round of BOOM."
c500_Reinforce_3,It's like I can feel the power coursing through me!
c500_Gift_1,"Oh my gosh, is this a limited-edition BOOM gift pack?"
c500_Gift_2,"Heh-heh, thanks. Is there anything that I could get you?"
c500_Gift_3,Hmm? What's this all about?
c500_Attractive_Up_1,"Heh-heh, I'm super nervous."
c500_Attractive_Up_2,I will give you the honor of playing the great gaming classic BOOM with me.
c500_Attractive_Up_3,"Heh-heh, I knew I'd be happy with you."
c500_Party_Deploy_1,Full steam ahead!
c500_Field_Touch_1,What's the matter?
c500_Field_Go_1,Here we go.
c500_Battle_Enter_1,BOOM girl to the rescue!
c500_Battle_Ready_1,Shall we start the experiment?
c500_Battle_Ready_2,"Absent a catastrophic failure, we should be fine..."
c500_Battle_Ready_3,Safety first!
c500_Reload_1,Reloading now.
c500_Reload_2,Battery overload.
c500_Reload_3,I'm overwhelmed... need a rest.
c500_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,BOOM installed!
c500_Ult_Skill_1,BOOM! BOOM!! BOOM!!!
c500_FullBurst_1,Time for the grand finale!
c500_Kill_Monster_1,Is... is it dead?
c500_Kill_Monster_2,"All right, what's next?"
c500_Kill_Monster_3,Wasn't I awesome?
c500_Damage_1,"Ow, that hurt!"
c500_Damage_2,Agh!
c500_Damage_3,Aargh...
c500_Die_1,Battery low...
c500_Win_1,Raptures eliminated!
c310_Lobby_Touch_1,"Welcome, Master."
c310_Lobby_Touch_2,Would you like some dessert?
c310_Lobby_Touch_3,What can I do for you?
c310_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm ready whenever you need me.
c310_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,How has your day been?
c310_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If Cocoa or Soda gives you any trouble, please let me know."
c310_Lobby_Stay_1,Are you busy at the moment?
c310_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm always here, so don't hesitate to call me if you need a hand."
c310_Outpost_Touch_1,What kind of service can satisfy every customer?
c310_Outpost_Touch_2,"I am confident that the service we provide at Maid Cafe is world-class.
We look forward to your visit when you have time."
c310_Outpost_Touch_3,"Do you usually get enough rest day to day, Master?
I hope you can get some well-deserved rest on your day off."
c310_Gacha_Get_1,"Hello, my name is Ade,
and I'll be at your service."
c310_Reinforce_1,"We are always striving to provide you with better service, so please stay tuned."
c310_Reinforce_2,I feel like I am making progress.
c310_Reinforce_3,"Hehe, I think I'm more capable of assisting you now, Master."
c310_Gift_1,Oh my gosh! Is this for me?
c310_Gift_2,Wait just a moment. Let me see if I can find something to give you in return.
c310_Gift_3,"Thank you for your kindness, Master. I appreciate it."
c310_Attractive_Up_1,"Thank you for taking care of me, Master."
c310_Attractive_Up_2,I will repay you with the best service I can offer.
c310_Attractive_Up_3,"It's my honor to serve you, Master."
c310_Party_Deploy_1,I won't let you down.
c310_Field_Touch_1,"I'm here, Master."
c310_Field_Go_1,Going this way.
c310_Battle_Enter_1,Order received.
c310_Battle_Ready_1,Let's take care of each other.
c310_Battle_Ready_2,"Just remain calm, like we always do."
c310_Battle_Ready_3,"Let's start cleaning, shall we?"
c310_Reload_1,Let me take a break.
c310_Reload_2,I'll check it out and be right back.
c310_Reload_3,I need a second.
c310_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Preparation complete, ready to serve."
c310_Ult_Skill_1,I'll provide you with the best service.
c310_FullBurst_1,It's the rush hour. Leave it to me!
c310_Kill_Monster_1,One down.
c310_Kill_Monster_2,Is it over?
c310_Kill_Monster_3,All clear.
c310_Damage_1,Ahh!
c310_Damage_2,Gah!
c310_Damage_3,Ow...
c310_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Master."
c310_Win_1,Are you satisfied with my service?
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"I'm officially renaming Valentine's Day to Villaintine's Day!
If you're not on board, then forget I said anything."
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"Get your own dessert...
Fine, I guess that's supposed to be my job."
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"I will cast a curse to make it more delicious...
Ah, I mean... a spell?"
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you want something to eat, just say so! 
I'll bring you anything you want."
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Do you dig my new look?
I know I do."
c101_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'll provide you with service that'll leave you satisfied, guaranteed."
c101_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"Darn it,
this is digging into my time as a villain. Hurry up and get over here."
c101_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll go make some Villain Omurice.
Don't get your hopes up! This isn't meant for you."
c101_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"If you're unsatisfied with my performance in any way, you can report me to the Maid Cafe.
However, as far as I know, they haven't received any complaints so far."
c101_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm handing out cookies to make people miserable!
Mwahahaha!"
c101_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Come to the Maid Cafe if you want to see
what dastardly deeds I'm up to."
c101_02_Gacha_Get_1,"Are you the one I'm supposed to serve?
Pleasure to be working with you."
c101_02_Reinforce_1,"You should start calling me the Head Maid!
Huh? I'm unqualified for that position, you say?"
c101_02_Reinforce_2,"I'll cook something really nice for you,
so stay tuned!"
c101_02_Reinforce_3,"At this rate,
I could become a regular employee at the Maid Cafe."
c101_02_Gift_1,"Maids can receive gifts? This is great.
I want more!"
c101_02_Gift_2,"Don't go falling in love with me,
'cause we're never gonna be together."
c101_02_Gift_3,"Hey.
Are you trying to bribe me?"
c101_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Uh oh... I think we're starting to be on the same wavelength.
This is dangerous."
c101_02_Attractive_Up_2,I could be your exclusive maid if you wanted.
c101_02_Attractive_Up_3,"I made this omurice especially for you, with lots of love."
c101_02_Party_Deploy_1,This villainous maid is ready to rock and roll!
c101_02_Field_Touch_1,Huh? Someone is ordering already?
c101_02_Field_Go_1,Figured.
c101_02_Battle_Enter_1,Ready to serve.
c101_02_Battle_Ready_1,He is under my protection!
c101_02_Battle_Ready_2,Let's get this over with so we can go back.
c101_02_Battle_Ready_3,I'll sweep you all up like it's nothing.
c101_02_Reload_1,"Keep calm and keep squirting the ketchup, everyone."
c101_02_Reload_2,These maid outfits are such a nuisance.
c101_02_Reload_3,Recharge!
c101_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,You're finished now.
c101_02_Ult_Skill_1,Open wide! Omurice coming right up!
c101_02_FullBurst_1,Mwahahaha! How does it taste?
c101_02_Kill_Monster_1,That was easier than I thought.
c101_02_Kill_Monster_2,All clear.
c101_02_Kill_Monster_3,These will make nice decorations at the cafe.
c101_02_Damage_1,Ouch!
c101_02_Damage_2,Ow!
c101_02_Damage_3,*Gasp*
c101_02_Die_1,"Agh, the villain omurice didn't work!"
c101_02_Win_1,That's the power of being a maid!
c820_Lobby_Touch_1,Do you have something important to bother me with?
c820_Lobby_Touch_2,Let me know if you need my help.
c820_Lobby_Touch_3,Where's my sister?
c820_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Is there something I can help you with?
c820_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"How do you think the mansion is faring?
We are all gone..."
c820_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,So the Mabeasts here are called Raptures... We must remain vigilant.
c820_Lobby_Stay_1,I'll wait here.
c820_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You seem busy, so I'll go make some snacks. Once things calm down, please take a break."
c820_Outpost_Touch_1,"Housework is my specialty, so I'm here to help if you need any assistance."
c820_Outpost_Touch_2,"A maid cafe, you say? Who do they serve?"
c820_Outpost_Touch_3,Mayonnaise?! Why is there mayonnaise here?
c820_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Rem, in the service of Margrave Mathers. It's a pleasure to meet you."
c820_Reinforce_1,Leave anything requiring strength to me.
c820_Reinforce_2,Do you think I've caught up to my sister?
c820_Reinforce_3,I still have a long way to go if I want to keep all of you safe.
c820_Gift_1,Thank you.
c820_Gift_2,Is it all right for me to receive something this nice?
c820_Gift_3,Oh my goodness! I need to share this with my sister!
c820_Attractive_Up_1,There is such a kindness within you.
c820_Attractive_Up_2,"Somehow, I feel quite happy."
c820_Attractive_Up_3,"If you are ever in need, I will be your strength."
c820_Party_Deploy_1,"I'm inexperienced, but I'll do my best."
c820_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c820_Field_Go_1,Is it this way?
c820_Battle_Enter_1,I'll take the lead!
c820_Battle_Ready_1,Leave it to me!
c820_Battle_Ready_2,Slice and dice.
c820_Battle_Ready_3,I will fulfill my duty as a maid.
c820_Reload_1,Stepping back for a moment...
c820_Reload_2,I'll be back soon.
c820_Reload_3,Let me check on a few things.
c820_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Preparations are complete!
c820_Ult_Skill_1,Get ready!
c820_FullBurst_1,Time to go all out!
c820_Kill_Monster_1,Mission complete!
c820_Kill_Monster_2,Is that all?
c820_Kill_Monster_3,They make fine adversaries.
c820_Damage_1,Ah!
c820_Damage_2,Ow!
c820_Damage_3,Ugh!
c820_Die_1,I can't measure up to my sister...
c820_Win_1,I did it! It's all thanks to Ram's backup!
c821_Lobby_Touch_1,"In order to grow, you have to work hard."
c821_Lobby_Touch_2,Hi there. I hope today's another good day.
c821_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm glad to have Rem and Ram by my side, 'cause I know I can rely on them."
c821_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,May the blessings of the spirits be with you.
c821_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"People always treat me differently because I'm a half elf, but not you.
I'm grateful that you treat me as I am."
c821_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,What a fascinating place this is! I'll have to tell everyone about it when I return to my world!
c821_Lobby_Stay_1,Shall we go for a walk with Puck?
c821_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Do you have something important to take care of? Take care and come back safely.
c821_Outpost_Touch_1,The weapons Nikkes have are absolutely fascinating!
c821_Outpost_Touch_2,There are so many shiny buildings! It's a sight I've never seen in Lugunica.
c821_Outpost_Touch_3,What's that delicious smell? It's making me hungry.
c821_Gacha_Get_1,My name is Emilia. Nice to meet you.
c821_Reinforce_1,"We still have a long way to go, but I'll work even harder!"
c821_Reinforce_2,It seems that I've grown somewhat.
c821_Reinforce_3,"I've gained a bit more confidence, thanks to you."
c821_Gift_1,Are you giving this to me? Thank you.
c821_Gift_2,This is fantastic! Looks like Puck's a fan as well.
c821_Gift_3,"Thanks! I'll definitely find a way to repay you, I promise!"
c821_Attractive_Up_1,Thank you for taking care of even the small things.
c821_Attractive_Up_2,"I'm not used to receiving kindness from others... Still, it brings me joy."
c821_Attractive_Up_3,"I've made so many wonderful memories, all thanks to you."
c821_Party_Deploy_1,You can count on me!
c821_Field_Touch_1,What is it?
c821_Field_Go_1,Are you sure that's where you want me to go?
c821_Battle_Enter_1,I'm gonna crush them into dust!
c821_Battle_Ready_1,Let's do this!
c821_Battle_Ready_2,I will overcome this!
c821_Battle_Ready_3,"Puck, let's go!"
c821_Reload_1,I need more time!
c821_Reload_2,"Argh, hold on!"
c821_Reload_3,I'm almost done!
c821_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm all set!
c821_Ult_Skill_1,"You asked for this, and I thank you for it."
c821_FullBurst_1,Let's work together!
c821_Kill_Monster_1,Yeah!
c821_Kill_Monster_2,Go away!
c821_Kill_Monster_3,It's done!
c821_Damage_1,Gah!
c821_Damage_2,Agh!
c821_Damage_3,Kyaa!
c821_Die_1,Sorry... I know I wasn't much help...
c821_Win_1,I'm glad you're safe. Everyone has worked incredibly hard!
c822_Lobby_Touch_1,"I'm busy resting right now, so what business do you have with me?"
c822_Lobby_Touch_2,Why are you giving me that look? It's creepy.
c822_Lobby_Touch_3,Have you seen Rem by any chance? I hope she isn't pushing herself too hard.
c822_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"As you can see, I'm both pitiful and in perfect health. Remember this look well."
c822_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'll share the cookies Rem baked, you should feel ever so grateful."
c822_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You look pretty calm. Well, maybe that's for the best, since you can't really relax when you're too tense."
c822_Lobby_Stay_1,You manage to make me bored... Your audacity truly knows no limits.
c822_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Taking care of me should be your top priority, so you should be ashamed of yourself, you know."
c822_Outpost_Touch_1,"Rem handles most of the chores, while I'm primarily in charge of observation."
c822_Outpost_Touch_2,To yawn continuously is a telltale sign of the vacuity of one's mind. *Yawn*
c822_Outpost_Touch_3,"Such unusual buildings, such esoteric outfits... this reminds me of something someone once told me."
c822_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Ram, an employee of Lord Roswaal. I am to be under your employ for the interim."
c822_Reinforce_1,I still have more to give.
c822_Reinforce_2,"Now, I can show you what I can do."
c822_Reinforce_3,I'm starting to feel like my old self again...
c822_Gift_1,"Well, well, what do we have here?"
c822_Gift_2,"Someone's feeling generous, huh?"
c822_Gift_3,I appreciate the sentiment.
c822_Attractive_Up_1,"I must say, you don't seem like such a bad person."
c822_Attractive_Up_2,I'll prepare tea for you. Do you have quality tea leaves here?
c822_Attractive_Up_3,Thanks are in order.
c822_Party_Deploy_1,"So, you need my help?"
c822_Field_Touch_1,I guess I have no choice.
c822_Field_Go_1,Just get on with it.
c822_Battle_Enter_1,I'll make sure to settle this account.
c822_Battle_Ready_1,You are really making me work.
c822_Battle_Ready_2,How irksome.
c822_Battle_Ready_3,"Fine, I'll cooperate."
c822_Reload_1,I need a short break. One moment.
c822_Reload_2,I'm a bit tired.
c822_Reload_3,I'll leave this to you for a bit.
c822_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c822_Ult_Skill_1,I'll make you regret this!
c822_FullBurst_1,Let's wrap this up. Once and for all.
c822_Kill_Monster_1,As if this was going to end any other way.
c822_Kill_Monster_2,This is all thanks to me being here.
c822_Kill_Monster_3,This was a waste of my time.
c822_Damage_1,Ow!
c822_Damage_2,Tsk!
c822_Damage_3,Ugh!
c822_Die_1,"Lord Roswaal, I apologize..."
c822_Win_1,"You mess with the Ram, you get the horns."
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_1,May you be blessed by the spirits.
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_2,Rem and I baked a batch of cookies. Would you like some?
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"It's a good thing Rem and Ram are here with me.
I'd probably lose my head if I were here alone."
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Rem made some tea. You're free to join us if you like.
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This outfit is quite different from what we have at the mansion. 
Am I wearing it correctly?"
c821_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"What should I say to the customers?
""May I help you?"""
c821_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Puck usually helps me with my hair. How does it look?
c821_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is it okay if I wait here? Safe travels!
c821_01_Outpost_Touch_1,A train? I didn't realize Nikkes rode such dragon carriages.
c821_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'll be volunteering at the Maid Cafe for a little while.
Do come along!"
c821_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"I made omurice with Cocoa today.
What was that magic spell that makes it taste better again?"
c821_01_Gacha_Get_1,My name is Emilia. I'll do my best to help from now on.
c821_01_Reinforce_1,"If I want to become a tried-and-true maid, I need to work even harder."
c821_01_Reinforce_2,I think I'm starting to get the hang of being a maid!
c821_01_Reinforce_3,"It's because of you that I've been able to work this hard.
I'll repay you somehow, promise!"
c821_01_Gift_1,"Is this really for me?
Hehe, thanks a bunch!"
c821_01_Gift_2,Thanks for the gift!
c821_01_Gift_3,Thank you. I feel I should give you something in return... Are you hungry? I can make some curry for you. It's my specialty!
c821_01_Attractive_Up_1,Thanks for always treating me equally!
c821_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I'll repay you with the best service, just like Ade said... right? Oh, wait, no?"
c821_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Coming to a place I didn't know made me anxious, 
but you really helped put my mind at ease."
c821_01_Party_Deploy_1,Leave it to me!
c821_01_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c821_01_Field_Go_1,What's that over there?
c821_01_Battle_Enter_1,"Come on, everyone!"
c821_01_Battle_Ready_1,Time to buckle down!
c821_01_Battle_Ready_2,"Your time is up, dastardly villain!"
c821_01_Battle_Ready_3,"Puck, a little help here!"
c821_01_Reload_1,I've gotta calm down...
c821_01_Reload_2,"Sorry, I've been pushing myself too hard."
c821_01_Reload_3,I'll be back in a second!
c821_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,That concludes our preparation.
c821_01_Ult_Skill_1,I'll give you my best shot!
c821_01_FullBurst_1,Here goes nothing!
c821_01_Kill_Monster_1,Victory is mine!
c821_01_Kill_Monster_2,I've got this covered!
c821_01_Kill_Monster_3,Stay down!
c821_01_Damage_1,Eeep!
c821_01_Damage_2,Ouch!
c821_01_Damage_3,Aargh!
c821_01_Die_1,I'm sorry for being inadequate...
c821_01_Win_1,Well done! We couldn't have done this without everyone's help!
c043_Lobby_Touch_1,"Welcome back, Honey.
... Let's move quickly."
c043_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you're feeling peckish, you'll have to sort it out yourself.
... But if you're really starving, want me to whip something up for you?"
c043_Lobby_Touch_3,"You seem unusually weary today.
... Don't push yourself too hard."
c043_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Give me those clothes.
... You really should do your own laundry, you know."
c043_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This outfit is hardly what I'd call efficient.
... But I'm glad that you seem to have taken a liking to it."
c043_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I feel more at ease with you by my side.
... Don't get too close to me."
c043_Lobby_Stay_1,"Come back safe.
... If you're late, I won't be here all night."
c043_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Don't abandon your post when you're on your mission.
... But I'll miss you, Honey."
c043_Outpost_Touch_1,I feel strangely comfortable here. Maybe it's because it's your workplace.
c043_Outpost_Touch_2,"Would you come to the Hotel?
... There's something I need your help with."
c043_Outpost_Touch_3,How long do I have to keep up this act...?
c043_Gacha_Get_1,"I've been waiting for you, Honey.
... I'll also eliminate the target quickly this time."
c043_Reinforce_1,"Oh my, looks like my stamina has improved!
... Additional support received."
c043_Reinforce_2,"Don't tell me you have other tricks up your sleeve.
... I'll do everything I can to improve for you."
c043_Reinforce_3,"Thank you for taking care of me.
... I'll repay you with a stellar performance."
c043_Gift_1,"Oh my, Honey! I'm so happy!
... Why did you get me something all of a sudden?"
c043_Gift_2,"I'll accept it for now.
... How do you always have such impeccable taste?"
c043_Gift_3,"I will cherish it forever!
... I just hope this isn't a bribe."
c043_Attractive_Up_1,"I only have eyes for you, hehe.
... You are quite a mystery."
c043_Attractive_Up_2,"You're not bothersome in the slightest.
... In fact, I find myself growing rather fond of you... and that could spell trouble."
c043_Attractive_Up_3,"I want to be by your side forever.
... Because you're a good person."
c043_Party_Deploy_1,"Wherever you go, I'll always be with you.
... Let's go."
c043_Field_Touch_1,"What is it?
Is there something else you want to say?"
c043_Field_Go_1,"Coming, Honey.
Follow me."
c043_Battle_Enter_1,Found the target.
c043_Battle_Ready_1,Entering combat.
c043_Battle_Ready_2,Subduing target.
c043_Battle_Ready_3,Stay back.
c043_Reload_1,Reload!
c043_Reload_2,Target not eliminated.
c043_Reload_3,Target eliminated.
c043_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Honey.
... Hurry up."
c043_Ult_Skill_1,"Hold on a moment.
... Target eliminated."
c043_FullBurst_1,Let's wrap this up.
c043_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c043_Kill_Monster_2,Done.
c043_Kill_Monster_3,Clear.
c043_Damage_1,Uh.
c043_Damage_2,Ugh.
c043_Damage_3,Ow.
c043_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Honey.
... I'll have to sit this one out."
c043_Win_1,"I'm glad you're safe.
... Mission complete."
c550_Lobby_Touch_1,"What are you looking at? 
Is this the first time you've seen a cheerleader?"
c550_Lobby_Touch_2,"Quit staring at my face for more than 5 seconds, Coach."
c550_Lobby_Touch_3,"You want me to cheer you on, huh?
Then, turn around."
c550_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I'll let you make eye contact with me, but for ten seconds only."
c550_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I still can't stand people staring at me.
But your gaze... well, it's tolerable, I suppose."
c550_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"With you by my side, I don't see anything worth being afraid of."
c550_Lobby_Stay_1,"Coach, if you're not gonna do anything, why even bother calling me out here?
I sacrificed practice time for this... If I mess up again, it's on you, got it?"
c550_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Coach, I know I told you not to stare at me, but...
Isn't it a bit rude to completely ignore me? Hurry up and help me with practice."
c550_Outpost_Touch_1,Is there no place that I can practice alone?
c550_Outpost_Touch_2,"Victory! Let's hear it for victory! 
... Hold up, how long you been staring at me? Quit with the staring!"
c550_Outpost_Touch_3,Do you happen to know any Nikke who would make a good cheerleader?
c550_Gacha_Get_1,"Once you've had a taste of my cheerleading,
you'll never settle for less.
Your victory is guaranteed."
c550_Reinforce_1,I'll repay you with some top-notch cheerleading.
c550_Reinforce_2,"This time, I think I can look directly at the crowd without flinching."
c550_Reinforce_3,"Thanks to you, Coach, I can cheer with a louder voice."
c550_Gift_1,"If it makes you happy, I'll accept it."
c550_Gift_2,"What's this? Doesn't seem like it's your first time giving a gift to a girl, huh?"
c550_Gift_3,"Seems like I'm always receiving your gifts...
Well, thanks anyway."
c550_Attractive_Up_1,"The reason my face is red is that I was cheering too hard.
It's not because of you, so don't get any funny ideas."
c550_Attractive_Up_2,"Something isn't right.
This isn't the same jitters I had on stage."
c550_Attractive_Up_3,"This won't end up with me cheering about how much I love you, right?"
c550_Party_Deploy_1,Want to hear my cheerleading?
c550_Field_Touch_1,Let's get our cheer on!
c550_Field_Go_1,"Let's head over there!
Looks like I'm needed."
c550_Battle_Enter_1,I will give you strength!
c550_Battle_Ready_1,Go! Go! Victory!
c550_Battle_Ready_2,"Don't sweat it, the squad's here!"
c550_Battle_Ready_3,"If we can't do it, no one can!"
c550_Reload_1,I'll keep cheering after this.
c550_Reload_2,There's still plenty of time.
c550_Reload_3,Get ready to cheer!
c550_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Now, it's my turn!"
c550_Ult_Skill_1,Time to get you all jazzed up!
c550_FullBurst_1,B-E-S-T! spells BEST!
c550_Kill_Monster_1,I'm on a roll now!
c550_Kill_Monster_2,I'm gonna see this through with you!
c550_Kill_Monster_3,Can you feel the team spirit?
c550_Damage_1,Ouch!
c550_Damage_2,Kyaa!
c550_Damage_3,Ow!
c550_Die_1,I guess my cheers weren't enough...
c550_Win_1,"This time, my cheerleading was perfect!"
c330_Lobby_Touch_1,"Every king must listen to the requests of subjects.
Do you have something you would ask of me?"
c330_Lobby_Touch_2,"Chime is the kingdom's royal aide.
This means that she has to be with the King at all times."
c330_Lobby_Touch_3,"Trombe? She is my faithful steed.
What more is there to know?"
c330_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Did you call your king?
c330_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you have a wish, please tell me.
I will make sure that it comes true."
c330_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Wherever you are, do not forget that you are a subject of this kingdom."
c330_Lobby_Stay_1,"You have gone off without your king? You must truly be disguised with me. Disguised... Disgorge... Disgust? Anyway, I will wait."
c330_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Waiting for a busy citizen is also the role of a king.
Hohohoho..! Cough. Cough. A-ahem."
c330_Outpost_Touch_1,"This is a truly amazing place, so much so that I would consider making this the second palace of our kingdom."
c330_Outpost_Touch_2,"So this is the Inpost. Is this your kingdom?
Ah... yes, it's called the Outpost. I knew that, I was merely trying to amuse you with wordplay."
c330_Outpost_Touch_3,"Everyone looks to be enjoying themselves here, and it's all thanks to everything you've done for them."
c330_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Crown, the king of this kingdom.
Do you wish to become a subject of my kingdom? You are welcome to."
c330_Reinforce_1,"I've gotten stronger, like a child going through adultery. 
Ah... adolescence, is it? Er... I knew that."
c330_Reinforce_2,"As long as my subjects need it, I can become stronger."
c330_Reinforce_3,"With this, the kingdom has become stronger."
c330_Gift_1,"So you're offering a tribe? Ah, right, tribute.
I-I see. I will put it to good use."
c330_Gift_2,I cannot turn away a gift from my subject. Thank you.
c330_Gift_3,"This is called a gift...?
But why are you giving it to me?"
c330_Attractive_Up_1,"Whenever I look at you, my heart starts to pound in my chest...
Do you think there's something wrong with it?"
c330_Attractive_Up_2,"A king should view all of their subjects equally...
But I hold you in special regard."
c330_Attractive_Up_3,You are someone whom I cherish as much as Chime.
c330_Party_Deploy_1,"If it's a request from my subject, I have to accept."
c330_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c330_Field_Go_1,"Oh, right, not there. I-I knew that."
c330_Battle_Enter_1,Coming.
c330_Battle_Ready_1,Don't worry. I will protect you.
c330_Battle_Ready_2,Believe in your king. Victory will be ours.
c330_Battle_Ready_3,Have faith. I will protect my people.
c330_Reload_1,This is going on a bit long.
c330_Reload_2,Wait a moment. It will end soon.
c330_Reload_3,"Re-engaging, er... I mean reloading."
c330_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Giddy-up, Trombe!"
c330_Ult_Skill_1,Down with those who would threaten the kingdom.
c330_FullBurst_1,"Now, we must focus our attacks."
c330_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c330_Kill_Monster_2,This is the power of the king.
c330_Kill_Monster_3,Be gone.
c330_Damage_1,Agh.
c330_Damage_2,Oof.
c330_Damage_3,*Phew*
c330_Die_1,"I think the wise thing to do now is to call for a ""strategic retreat""..."
c330_Win_1,Securing victory for their subjects is a king's duty.
c361_Lobby_Touch_1,"Tell me if you need anything, and I'll see to it right away!"
c361_Lobby_Touch_2,Hmm... What kind of function should I add for T.A.L.O.S. this time?
c361_Lobby_Touch_3,"Huh? You want to take T.A.L.O.S. for a spin?
Only I can pilot T.A.L.O.S..."
c361_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I've been with T.A.L.O.S. for a long time.
He's not just a colleague, but a friend."
c361_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"No, I'm not uncomfortable inside here at all.
In fact, there's nowhere I'm more comfortable than here."
c361_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"T.A.L.O.S. was born to engage in combat, and he can make anything I need in a snap. There's nothing he can't do. Isn't he amazing?"
c361_Lobby_Stay_1,I hope I'm not boring you...
c361_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Um... when are you coming back?
I guess T.A.L.O.S. and I can play some word games until you get back."
c361_Outpost_Touch_1,Is there a workshop or armory here? Somewhere where T.A.L.O.S. can get a tune-up.
c361_Outpost_Touch_2,Just passing through.
c361_Outpost_Touch_3,"Oh, sorry for blocking the way..."
c361_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Kilo from the Heavy Gram Squad.
T.A.L.O.S. Joined."
c361_Reinforce_1,"T.A.L.O.S., the maintenance is done. How is it?
Status optimal."
c361_Reinforce_2,"You have become stronger, Kilo. I'm proud of you.
It's not enough. I need to be stronger."
c361_Reinforce_3,I'll do everything I can to be of help.
c361_Gift_1,"Oh wow, oh boy... okay, I gotta calm down..."
c361_Gift_2,Th-thank you. I will treasure it forever.
c361_Gift_3,"You're not going to store that in the cockpit, are you? 
The cockpit is already full of presents from the Commander, and there is not much space left...
You don't have to say everything out loud, T.A.L.O.S.!"
c361_Attractive_Up_1,"I won't forget a single second that I spend with you, Commander."
c361_Attractive_Up_2,"Whenever I'm with you, I feel more energized."
c361_Attractive_Up_3,Thank you for always believing in me.
c361_Party_Deploy_1,"T.A.L.O.S., wake up.
Reboot complete. Hello, Kilo."
c361_Field_Touch_1,A-are you talking to me?
c361_Field_Go_1,Order received. Checking route.
c361_Battle_Enter_1,"Chance of success?
Very high."
c361_Battle_Ready_1,Good. Let's go.
c361_Battle_Ready_2,"Let... Let's do this, everyone."
c361_Battle_Ready_3,Engaging in combat.
c361_Reload_1,"T.A.L.O.S., initiate self-repair."
c361_Reload_2,Calm down... keep calm...
c361_Reload_3,Reload.
c361_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Kilo. Preparation complete.
c361_Ult_Skill_1,"- Let's go, T.A.L.O.S.!
- Roger."
c361_FullBurst_1,Focus your fire! Fire everything we've got!
c361_Kill_Monster_1,W-we did it!
c361_Kill_Monster_2,Nothing to it.
c361_Kill_Monster_3,Target down.
c361_Damage_1,Eek...!
c361_Damage_2,"T.A.L.O.S., are you okay?!"
c361_Damage_3,External glove damaged.
c361_Die_1,"Test failure.
I'm sorry... my best wasn't good enough..."
c361_Win_1,"Combat ended. We have won.
T.A.L.O.S., you did well!"
c501_Lobby_Touch_1,It's lovely weather outside today. Perfect day to stay inside and play some games.
c501_Lobby_Touch_2,"If there is any electronic equipment you need, I could try making it for you.
I... I'm actually quite confident with this sort of thing!"
c501_Lobby_Touch_3,"Umm... Commander... Er, forget it, it's nothing...
I'll tell you later. Maybe next week? No, maybe next month..."
c501_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Elegg is so very, er...
Very... BOOM."
c501_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Personally, I think the best game ever made is Combat Ace...
But don't tell Elegg that."
c501_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Electricity is made by boiling water and spinning a turbine...
Oh, I guess I'm boring you. Sorry... I'll go in the corner and stay quiet."
c501_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander...? Are you outside?
Phew, finally I'm alone. Hehe, this is nice."
c501_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Is there anyone here? Hmm... I'm Trony, and I'm here to uphold justice! 
Prepare yourself, villain! Hehe, just like the way the Black Ark Ranger would say it."
c501_Outpost_Touch_1,"The Ark Rangers movie just got released in theaters. If-if you happen to have time, would you... 
No, there's no way you would want to come with me... I'll just go and watch it by myself..."
c501_Outpost_Touch_2,"Have you seen Elegg?
We were together just a moment ago, but I think she might have left..."
c501_Outpost_Touch_3,"You said that the elevator breaks down a lot, right?
Um... I think I'll just wait inside for a bit. I prefer being alone."
c501_Gacha_Get_1,I-I'm Trony. Glad to be part of the team.
c501_Reinforce_1,Note to self: Circuit calibration should be reinforced this way.
c501_Reinforce_2,"Wow, this feeling reminds me of BOOM."
c501_Reinforce_3,"I definitely feel stronger, even if you can't really tell..."
c501_Gift_1,"Um, just a moment. Let me jot down a note on the computer.
I got a gift from Commander today, hehe..."
c501_Gift_2,"Um... D-don't look at me like that.
Am I making a strange face right now?"
c501_Gift_3,"It's just a tiny gift, so l-I should probably calm down...
Hehe... hehehe."
c501_Attractive_Up_1,"Th-thank you for always being nice to...
Uhh, it feels like my heart is about to explode."
c501_Attractive_Up_2,"If there's any Ark Rangers merchandise that you want, I could maybe get you one... or two.
You know... as a token of my appreciation."
c501_Attractive_Up_3,"Being with you makes me feel so comfortable...
I'm looking forward to doing it more."
c501_Party_Deploy_1,M-me? Wouldn't it be better to send another Nikke instead of me?
c501_Field_Touch_1,"Oh, um... You called?"
c501_Field_Go_1,I'll be right there.
c501_Battle_Enter_1,I've got your back.
c501_Battle_Ready_1,Be careful not to run out of battery.
c501_Battle_Ready_2,I-I'm glad to be in this foxhole with you all.
c501_Battle_Ready_3,I guess I should do what needs to be done...
c501_Reload_1,Huh? The battery is dead.
c501_Reload_2,Repair complete.
c501_Reload_3,Just need to do some fixing... Don't leave me behind.
c501_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Preparation complete.
c501_Ult_Skill_1,Work complete. I did it! Hehe.
c501_FullBurst_1,Give them an electrifying blow!
c501_Kill_Monster_1,Neutralized.
c501_Kill_Monster_2,Let's wrap this up and go home...
c501_Kill_Monster_3,D-did you see that? I defeated it.
c501_Damage_1,Eek!
c501_Damage_2,Ugh…
c501_Damage_3,Ah...
c501_Die_1,"I guess this is where I fall.
It's been an honor to be fighting alongside you all..."
c501_Win_1,"I... I feel kinda cool, hehe."
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_1,These clothes carry with them the hope of the subjects.
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"You said you can't see my clothes that well?
That is because you are not perceiving them properly."
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"Chime said that with this, I have truly become a king.
Do you also see it that way?"
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You think my clothes are quite blinding? 
That is because you're seeing your own light spilling forth from within."
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Your faith and hope have made me a true king.
c330_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I am alone, but I am not lonely. 
That is because every subject in the kingdom fills me with light."
c330_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"I can wait.
Do what you have to and come back."
c330_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Do not worry.
My light will continue to shine in the dark spaces of your life."
c330_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"If I may give you a compliment, you are doing a fine job building up the kingdom's second palace."
c330_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"I will go wherever my subjects are.
Whether it is on the surface, up in the sky, or down below."
c330_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"It is always entertaining coming to the Uppost.
Oh, right, I meant the Outpost. I knew that."
c330_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Clothed in the adoration of the people, I will protect this kingdom as its true king."
c330_01_Reinforce_1,"I feel your affection and trust.
I will ensure it is not misplaced."
c330_01_Reinforce_2,"With your efforts, my clothes will shimmer even brighter."
c330_01_Reinforce_3,"Carrying my subjects' faith, I shall venture forth even further."
c330_01_Gift_1,"Another gift?
I have told you before that you should only receive gifts, not give them, for I am your king."
c330_01_Gift_2,"Your heart shines as brightly as these clothes of mine.
I will accept this gift gladly."
c330_01_Gift_3,"Your sincerity will be a great asset to the kingdom, and I will prove it to you."
c330_01_Attractive_Up_1,"It is rather peculiar. Lately, I have been unable to get you off my mind.
Is there something wrong with me?"
c330_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I wish you could continue to be by my side just like Chime...
But I know that is not possible."
c330_01_Attractive_Up_3,"I am no longer able to deny it.
You are special to me."
c330_01_Party_Deploy_1,I will answer my subjects' calls.
c330_01_Field_Touch_1,Tell me where to go.
c330_01_Field_Go_1,I will move as you wish.
c330_01_Battle_Enter_1,Step back. It is dangerous.
c330_01_Battle_Ready_1,It is time to show the majesty of the kingdom.
c330_01_Battle_Ready_2,Your king shall secure another victory for the crown.
c330_01_Battle_Ready_3,"I will protect you, as I protect all my subjects."
c330_01_Reload_1,I will re-engage shortly.
c330_01_Reload_2,"You can watch me, there's no need for worry in your eyes."
c330_01_Reload_3,This light will keep me going.
c330_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Trombe, maximum speed."
c330_01_Ult_Skill_1,"Under the light of the kingdom, all shall kneel."
c330_01_FullBurst_1,I'll take lead. Everyone follow me and attack.
c330_01_Kill_Monster_1,Is there more?
c330_01_Kill_Monster_2,This represents my subjects' faith in me.
c330_01_Kill_Monster_3,Kneel.
c330_01_Damage_1,Urgh.
c330_01_Damage_2,Agh.
c330_01_Damage_3,I'm okay.
c330_01_Die_1,I... I shall come back after a short rest.
c330_01_Win_1,Did you see? Your king has won another victory.
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"I will protect you, no matter what."
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"I will cherish this bandage forever,
for it is a precious treasure to me."
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_3,Do you think everyone is doing well?
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"So many precious things...
I must protect them all."
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I think I'm starting to understand who I am.
You all have been so kind and helpful."
c260_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I want to show everyone what I can do and make them proud of me.
c260_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'm fine.
I'm used to waiting."
c260_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm willing to keep waiting...
Because I don't feel lonely anymore."
c260_02_Outpost_Touch_1,It's still a place I dearly miss.
c260_02_Outpost_Touch_2,This is another place that I must protect at all costs.
c260_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"This reminds me of the moments shared with everyone.
They were such joyous times."
c260_02_Gacha_Get_1,"I won't cry anymore,
because there are people who I have to look after."
c260_02_Reinforce_1,"Thanks to you, I'll be able to keep going."
c260_02_Reinforce_2,I won't disappoint you.
c260_02_Reinforce_3,I've definitely become stronger.
c260_02_Gift_1,I've missed this.
c260_02_Gift_2,I will cherish it.
c260_02_Gift_3,"I remember everyone used to send me heartfelt gifts quite often...
Thank you."
c260_02_Attractive_Up_1,You've touched my heart in many ways.
c260_02_Attractive_Up_2,"I miss you... 
I miss you more than words can say."
c260_02_Attractive_Up_3,I can't believe I can like you even more.
c260_02_Party_Deploy_1,I'm always ready.
c260_02_Field_Touch_1,Yes? What is it?
c260_02_Field_Go_1,Moving.
c260_02_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c260_02_Battle_Ready_1,I guess I have no choice but to fight.
c260_02_Battle_Ready_2,I will send you off without pain.
c260_02_Battle_Ready_3,I will send you all away.
c260_02_Reload_1,I can still keep fighting.
c260_02_Reload_2,Preparing to reload.
c260_02_Reload_3,Hold on a little longer.
c260_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c260_02_Ult_Skill_1,Return to where you belong.
c260_02_FullBurst_1,I'll see it through!
c260_02_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c260_02_Kill_Monster_2,I'm sorry...
c260_02_Kill_Monster_3,Just a little more...
c260_02_Damage_1,Ahh!
c260_02_Damage_2,Argh...!
c260_02_Damage_3,Ouch!
c260_02_Die_1,"No, I wasn't... able to protect anyone..."
c260_02_Win_1,I'm glad I was able to protect everyone.
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"A comrade made this armor.
Maybe that's why my movements feel stiff..."
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"This is tailored to Chime's preferences.
It appears the kingdom is in need of knights."
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_3,Perhaps I'm used to another armor... but I'm famished.
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I may lack the pride befitting a knight wearing this armor, but I will do everything I can to protect the kingdom, and my friends within it."
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Whether in the kingdom or outside of it,
in the fight for humanity, I will never surrender."
c220_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Back in the kingdom, Chime would have packed me a lunch...
I could really go for one of those right now..."
c220_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"There is no time to waste.
I need to get rid of those intruders as soon as possible."
c220_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"*Sigh* Right. They said resting is part of the job... 
I can't do it for a long time, but I will take a short break for you."
c220_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place never fails to impress, no matter how many times I see it."
c220_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Seeing this place stirs not just hunger in my stomach but my very being.
... I must return."
c220_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"If Crown and Chime saw this place,
they would want to make it a royal palace."
c220_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I will reclaim the surface for humanity,
and it does not matter what kind of armor or methods I employ."
c220_01_Reinforce_1,"This is the way to reinforce this armor...?
Understood."
c220_01_Reinforce_2,I'm getting more and more accustomed to this armor.
c220_01_Reinforce_3,A little more maintenance will go a long way.
c220_01_Gift_1,Thank you for your constant support.
c220_01_Gift_2,"I promise I will return the kindness, one day."
c220_01_Gift_3,"Food, for me?
... You truly are a remarkable human."
c220_01_Attractive_Up_1,"When humanity one day regains the surface, I will be there by your...
... Never mind."
c220_01_Attractive_Up_2,"You are a good human.
I hope that never changes."
c220_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Regardless of what I become in the future,
I will protect you no matter what."
c220_01_Party_Deploy_1,"All right, let's do it together."
c220_01_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting orders.
c220_01_Field_Go_1,Okay. Let's move.
c220_01_Battle_Enter_1,Incoming.
c220_01_Battle_Ready_1,Annihilate them all.
c220_01_Battle_Ready_2,"Fret not, victory is assured."
c220_01_Battle_Ready_3,I will protect everyone.
c220_01_Reload_1,In order to reload faster...
c220_01_Reload_2,We're good after some maintenance.
c220_01_Reload_3,I'm getting accustomed to the armor now.
c220_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Now is the time!
c220_01_Ult_Skill_1,Give it your all! Run through them all!
c220_01_FullBurst_1,Don't stop! Give it everything you've got!
c220_01_Kill_Monster_1,It's the end.
c220_01_Kill_Monster_2,Come!
c220_01_Kill_Monster_3,Moving on to the next one.
c220_01_Damage_1,Tsk.
c220_01_Damage_2,Gasp!
c220_01_Damage_3,Urgh.
c220_01_Die_1,No... This... This isn't how I go down...!
c220_01_Win_1,Have we emerged victorious...? This armor will suffice.
c314_Lobby_Touch_1,Master! I was waiting for you!
c314_Lobby_Touch_2,"Oh boy, this outfit is a bit tight.
Is there any chance I can get a larger size?"
c314_Lobby_Touch_3,"Alice was complimenting me on how cute I looked.
Do you agree?"
c314_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Why are you looking at me like that? You're making me self-conscious.
c314_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Check it out, Master,
I can clean things with my tail!"
c314_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Good luck to you, Master!"
c314_Lobby_Stay_1,"Master, where are you?
You haven't left me, have you?"
c314_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"If you keep disappearing on me, I'm gonna hold onto your arm and never let go."
c314_Outpost_Touch_1,"What beautiful weather we're having.
A perfect day for cleaning."
c314_Outpost_Touch_2,I miss Cocoa and Ade so much...
c314_Outpost_Touch_3,"Hehe, back to the cafe, home sweet home!"
c314_Gacha_Get_1,"Now you and I are squadmates, Master!"
c314_Reinforce_1,Keep it up!
c314_Reinforce_2,You think this makes me look cuter?
c314_Reinforce_3,"Wow, this must be the power of luck."
c314_Gift_1,"Another gift?
But you've already given me so much..."
c314_Gift_2,"I want to give you something in return...
How about a lucky letter?"
c314_Gift_3,"Here, let me try and bestow some luck upon you."
c314_Attractive_Up_1,I feel like I can depend on you.
c314_Attractive_Up_2,"I'm having trouble catching my breath.
Could it be because of this outfit?"
c314_Attractive_Up_3,"Master, I lo... er...
I mean, thank you."
c314_Party_Deploy_1,I'll hold the line!
c314_Field_Touch_1,Huh?
c314_Field_Go_1,Bit by bit...
c314_Battle_Enter_1,The battle begins.
c314_Battle_Ready_1,I-I can do this!
c314_Battle_Ready_2,What if I mess up?
c314_Battle_Ready_3,Here we go.
c314_Reload_1,I won't give up!
c314_Reload_2,"Oh gosh, I'm so nervous…"
c314_Reload_3,Cocoa... Ade...
c314_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm gonna shine bright!
c314_Ult_Skill_1,Ah! Did you see anyone coming?
c314_FullBurst_1,I will clean it up!
c314_Kill_Monster_1,Yeah! It worked!
c314_Kill_Monster_2,Cleaning finished!
c314_Kill_Monster_3,Lucky bunny!
c314_Damage_1,Woo...
c314_Damage_2,Gasp.
c314_Damage_3,Ouch!
c314_Die_1,The cafe... we have to protect it...
c314_Win_1,I-I made it!
c195_Lobby_Touch_1,Here I come!
c195_Lobby_Touch_2,"My tail isn't moving when I walk, is it?
Can you check it for me?"
c195_Lobby_Touch_3,"Are these carrots in my hair edible?
May I eat them?"
c195_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"The main reason I love this outfit
is because you gave it to me."
c195_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You wanna know why I love this place so much?
Because you're here."
c195_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You and I are gonna live happily ever after!
c195_Lobby_Stay_1,"Bunnies aren't meant to be solitary creatures, you know.
They get lonely..."
c195_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Don't be gone too long.
I'll be here waiting for you."
c195_Outpost_Touch_1,"Gah! You scared me!
Where are you headed to?"
c195_Outpost_Touch_2,"Are there no other rabbits around?
Like Twinkling Bunny or Slippery Bunny?"
c195_Outpost_Touch_3,"All right, time to go out on a walk. Bounce, bounce!"
c195_Gacha_Get_1,"Check it out,
I've got ears and a tail! Aren't they adorable?"
c195_Reinforce_1,"Whoa, I can feel my power soaring!"
c195_Reinforce_2,"Let's hang out, Rabbity.
We've got all night."
c195_Reinforce_3,"I can feel the magic in the air.
How did you do that?"
c195_Gift_1,"You're the best, Rabbity! I feel so happy now!"
c195_Gift_2,Wowee! I'm gonna show this off to Queen.
c195_Gift_3,"Hmm... I don't have anything to give you in return...
Unless you want some carrots."
c195_Attractive_Up_1,"I just love you to bits, Rabbity."
c195_Attractive_Up_2,"Whenever I see you,
my heart won't stop racing."
c195_Attractive_Up_3,"Whenever you're around, I can't stop blushing."
c195_Party_Deploy_1,"I'm happy going anywhere, so long as you're with me."
c195_Field_Touch_1,"Alice the Wonderland Bunny, reporting in!"
c195_Field_Go_1,"Bounce, bounce!"
c195_Battle_Enter_1,Let's play together!
c195_Battle_Ready_1,This seems like fun!
c195_Battle_Ready_2,It's like playing hide-and-seek!
c195_Battle_Ready_3,Are you ready? I'm ready!
c195_Reload_1,Alice isn't home!
c195_Reload_2,Just a sec.
c195_Reload_3,Come and get me!
c195_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ugh! It's carrots!
c195_Ult_Skill_1,"Gotcha, carrots!"
c195_FullBurst_1,See you in heaven!
c195_Kill_Monster_1,Yahoo! Gotcha!
c195_Kill_Monster_2,"I did pretty good, don't you think?"
c195_Kill_Monster_3,This is fun!
c195_Damage_1,Gah!
c195_Damage_2,Whoa!
c195_Damage_3,*Sob*
c195_Die_1,So tired... but I'm not done having fun yet...
c195_Win_1,I had a great time! Where to now?
c551_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey Coach, do you wanna join me for cheerleading practice?"
c551_Lobby_Touch_2,"One, two... whoops, I missed the beat."
c551_Lobby_Touch_3,"It's always been my dream to join Rewind.
You have no idea how happy I am!"
c551_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you come to see me perform,
I feel like I'll be able to cheer twice as hard!"
c551_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Whenever you and I cheer together, my energy goes through the roof, teehee!"
c551_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Coach, give me your hand and let's do the wave! Wooooo!"
c551_Lobby_Stay_1,"Umm...
If you're going to be running late, can I go to the practice room first?"
c551_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I'll practice hard until you get here!
c551_Outpost_Touch_1,"Have you seen Bay by any chance?
We were supposed to practice together today..."
c551_Outpost_Touch_2,The stadium is my favorite place to be.
c551_Outpost_Touch_3,"Hey Coach, wanna check out the practice room?"
c551_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Clay from Rewind.
Three cheers for victory!"
c551_Reinforce_1,"Now, I can practice longer!"
c551_Reinforce_2,I feel like I can sync up to the rhythm better.
c551_Reinforce_3,"Thanks to Coach's guidance, I've grown tremendously!
Thank you so much!"
c551_Gift_1,Is this for me? I'm so happy!
c551_Gift_2,"It's kinda embarrassing to always be on the receiving end.
Someday, I'll definitely repay you, I promise!"
c551_Gift_3,"You always know exactly what to get me.
Thanks, Coach!"
c551_Attractive_Up_1,"You're the best, Coach!"
c551_Attractive_Up_2,I always feel over the moon whenever I see you!
c551_Attractive_Up_3,"You're looking even cooler lately...
This feeling is totally new to me..."
c551_Party_Deploy_1,I'll put my heart and soul into cheering you on!
c551_Field_Touch_1,Do you need some motivation?
c551_Field_Go_1,On it!
c551_Battle_Enter_1,I'll cheer as hard as I can!
c551_Battle_Ready_1,"Everyone, focus on me."
c551_Battle_Ready_2,Time to start my routine!
c551_Battle_Ready_3,"Cheer up!
Power up!"
c551_Reload_1,Cheer charging...
c551_Reload_2,Just a moment...
c551_Reload_3,Almost done!
c551_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready to cheer!
c551_Ult_Skill_1,Never give up!
c551_FullBurst_1,"Let's do the wave, everyone!"
c551_Kill_Monster_1,Let's keep it going!
c551_Kill_Monster_2,"Wow, we did it!"
c551_Kill_Monster_3,Hehe.
c551_Damage_1,Eeep!
c551_Damage_2,Ugh!
c551_Damage_3,Agh!
c551_Die_1,I'm sorry... Looks like my cheering wasn't enough...
c551_Win_1,Looks like our cheers worked! That's fantastic!
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Do you think younger patients will get a kick out of this bunny outfit?
Hehe, I'm only joking."
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"If I'm a rabbit, does that make you a tortoise?"
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_3,Don't be fooled by my appearance. I'm still a doctor who deserves respect.
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hehe, it seems that you like this outfit.
In that case, I'll wear it whenever you come for a check-up."
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I didn't know you were such a fan of animals.
Should I wear a cat or dog outfit next time?"
c130_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If you're a good boy and lie down on the bed,
I'll make sure this won't hurt."
c130_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Is it okay if I head back?
I have a lot of patients waiting for me."
c130_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"There's no point in trying to run from me, hehe!
Rabbits are very fast runners."
c130_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"If you find yourself in need of a bunny doctor, give me a shout!"
c130_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Hop, hop!"
c130_01_Outpost_Touch_3,Did you call? Are you feeling a bit under the weather?
c130_01_Gacha_Get_1,"How do I look?
Pretty adorable, right? Hehe!"
c130_01_Reinforce_1,"Thanks to you,
I think I've become stronger, hehe."
c130_01_Reinforce_2,I ought to examine you more thoroughly.
c130_01_Reinforce_3,"I'll take this as encouragement to work even harder.
Now, when should we book you for your next check up?"
c130_01_Gift_1,"Thank you, Commander!
I'll be sure to give you a more thorough examination next time to repay you."
c130_01_Gift_2,"You don't happen to have any carrots on hand, do you? Hehe."
c130_01_Gift_3,I'm touched! This makes me so happy!
c130_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Whenever I look at you, my heart starts to race.
You don't think I have heart problems, do you? Hehe."
c130_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I know I'm supposed to treat all my patients fairly,
but with you around, Commander, it's hard to keep that up, hehe."
c130_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Hmm... this is most troubling.
I keep imagining all sorts of strange things."
c130_01_Party_Deploy_1,Here comes the bunny doctor!
c130_01_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c130_01_Field_Go_1,Should I hop over there?
c130_01_Battle_Enter_1,"That's quite enough from you, you naughty germs!"
c130_01_Battle_Ready_1,This injection will be particularly painful!
c130_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll treat each and every one of you.
c130_01_Battle_Ready_3,"Stay behind me, Commander."
c130_01_Reload_1,"Hehe, how terrifying!"
c130_01_Reload_2,Just a moment.
c130_01_Reload_3,One... two...
c130_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready for the next physical!
c130_01_Ult_Skill_1,Here comes the needle!
c130_01_FullBurst_1,This will make all your pain go away.
c130_01_Kill_Monster_1,"Germs, be gone!"
c130_01_Kill_Monster_2,"Hehe, hehehe!"
c130_01_Kill_Monster_3,Next patient!
c130_01_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c130_01_Damage_2,Ow!
c130_01_Damage_3,Argh!
c130_01_Die_1,"Oh dear...
I'll have to leave the rest to you."
c130_01_Win_1,"All done! Next patient, please."
c283_Lobby_Touch_1,"What's wrong?
Do you wanna help put some sunscreen on my back?"
c283_Lobby_Touch_2,What do you think? Do you like this swimsuit?
c283_Lobby_Touch_3,"Since we're at the beach anyway, it's okay to kick back and relax."
c283_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"The way you're touching me... I don't know how much more I can take.
Come here and loosen this strap."
c283_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you'd like, I could wear this every day."
c283_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Here, come sit beside me. I can't go running over to you, after all.
I have my dignity to maintain!"
c283_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you taking a picture right now?
Or are you just... enjoying the show?"
c283_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hm... If you want to experience it firsthand, it might be better to come this way."
c283_Outpost_Touch_1,"Next time, let's ditch the deadweight and hit the sea. Just the two of us. How's that sound?"
c283_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm all for such a display of affection, even with everyone watching."
c283_Outpost_Touch_3,"Indeed, the air up on the surface is so different from the stale air of the underworld."
c283_Gacha_Get_1,"Hedonia's boss in a swimsuit...
I can safely say this is a privilege given only to you, Mister."
c283_Reinforce_1,Amassing influence requires formidable inner strength.
c283_Reinforce_2,"This investment will soon become a boon for our organization.
Of course, that includes you too, Mister."
c283_Reinforce_3,"Hmm, shall we use this power to party all through the night?"
c283_Gift_1,"Hot summer beach and a gift from a handsome man.
What more could I ask for?"
c283_Gift_2,"I give back as much as I get.
That's a personal rule of mine, so expect a gift sometime soon."
c283_Gift_3,"This is lovely.
I'll pay you back in my own way later, so you can look forward to that."
c283_Attractive_Up_1,"Thanks to you, I think this summer is going to be extra hot."
c283_Attractive_Up_2,"I'll see you tonight, Mister."
c283_Attractive_Up_3,"From now on, anyone who disturbs you will disappear without a trace."
c283_Party_Deploy_1,"If not me, who else could you possibly choose?"
c283_Field_Touch_1,"What's wrong, Mister?"
c283_Field_Go_1,"Did you hear that, guys?"
c283_Battle_Enter_1,"All right, let's have a look at your face."
c283_Battle_Ready_1,Let's wipe them out.
c283_Battle_Ready_2,"Let's make quick work of this and head back, everyone."
c283_Battle_Ready_3,Looks like it's time to return to our daily lives.
c283_Reload_1,They're putting up a greater resistance than I thought.
c283_Reload_2,"So, this is how you're showing up, huh?"
c283_Reload_3,Don't rile me. I'll deal with you soon enough.
c283_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Mister, I'm ready."
c283_Ult_Skill_1,What do you say we cool off?
c283_FullBurst_1,Fire until your gun barrels melt!
c283_Kill_Monster_1,How disappointing.
c283_Kill_Monster_2,Look at all those bullet holes...
c283_Kill_Monster_3,Is this all?
c283_Damage_1,*Cough*...!
c283_Damage_2,Damn it...
c283_Damage_3,Argh...!
c283_Die_1,"Tch... Don't you know who I am?
Attacking me is a death sentence."
c283_Win_1,Revenge is a dish best served cold.
c284_Lobby_Touch_1,"You don't think this is too revealing, do you?"
c284_Lobby_Touch_2,"The hot summer weather, the beach, even the swimsuits.
These are all unfamiliar to me, so I would appreciate your guidance."
c284_Lobby_Touch_3,I believe this attire complements the ambiance quite well.
c284_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Would you care to come inside? The sun is rather scorching out there.
c284_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I believe I have informed you before, but I do not have the habit of sharing what is mine.
Since you have entered my heart, everything of yours now belongs to me."
c284_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"When I close my eyes, memories of us together come flooding back...
What was your favorite part of this summer?"
c284_Lobby_Stay_1,"After all the trouble I've gone through to prepare this outfit, you won't even spare me a glance? How disheartening..."
c284_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I wonder where all those connections we made at the beach will lead to next?
Hehe, it's quite exciting."
c284_Outpost_Touch_1,"Have you seen Moran?
After she looked at the photos we took at the beach, she started sulking, and I haven't seen her since."
c284_Outpost_Touch_2,When will we get to spend some time alone?
c284_Outpost_Touch_3,"You mentioned there was a pool here, did you not?
Hmm... Perhaps having it to ourselves for a day wouldn't be too egregious, would it?"
c284_Gacha_Get_1,"I've prepared an outfit perfect for welcoming the summer.
I hope it pleases you."
c284_Reinforce_1,Memories of the sea strengthen me.
c284_Reinforce_2,Slow but steady wins the race.
c284_Reinforce_3,"In order to have you all to myself, I must work even harder."
c284_Gift_1,"I hope your affections are directed solely at me, hehe."
c284_Gift_2,"Every time summer rolls around, I think of you."
c284_Gift_3,You truly understand me.
c284_Attractive_Up_1,Our connection has deepened by leaps and bounds this summer. Even the taste of tea will grow richer for me.
c284_Attractive_Up_2,Your presence always makes me feel at ease.
c284_Attractive_Up_3,"Please don't ever change.
Let me come to you."
c284_Party_Deploy_1,I knew you would choose me.
c284_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c284_Field_Go_1,What a lovely breeze.
c284_Battle_Enter_1,"This time, I'll be the one supporting you."
c284_Battle_Ready_1,"What your heart desires, I shall make it a reality."
c284_Battle_Ready_2,I will fulfill my duties.
c284_Battle_Ready_3,I will show you the way of the Seimeikai.
c284_Reload_1,Don't rush it.
c284_Reload_2,The heat is rising.
c284_Reload_3,I entrust this to you momentarily.
c284_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Awaiting your orders.
c284_Ult_Skill_1,May this radiant summer day remain beautiful.
c284_FullBurst_1,You've touched what is mine. You will pay the price.
c284_Kill_Monster_1,That was nothing.
c284_Kill_Monster_2,Let's keep it going.
c284_Kill_Monster_3,... Finished.
c284_Damage_1,Ow!
c284_Damage_2,Careless.
c284_Damage_3,*Cough*
c284_Die_1,Was it all just memories of a midsummer night...?
c284_Win_1,It seems I will now be able to enjoy some quiet time with you.
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"This outfit isn't too... restrictive. It's quite nice, actually."
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Would you... like to have some ice cream with me, Counselor?"
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"You weren't lying about us spending next summer together, were you?"
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Counselor, I'm feeling a bit... uncomfortable. Could you... maybe loosen this for me? If you want, you could even untie it completely..."
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This summer was nice... I even made some new friends...
Though, I'm not sure how long they'll be able to put up with me."
c400_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I never thought I'd have the opportunity to enjoy the summer with you, Counselor.
I'm glad I was able to leave the Rehabilitation Center."
c400_01_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm so bored... Maybe I could browse through the photos I took last time...
c400_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"How can you ignore me when you're the one who made me wear this?
Don't be like that. Come here and hold my hand."
c400_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Maiden was teaching me how to play a game,
but I got a bit angry and hit the keyboard, and now it's busted."
c400_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"You said that's the swimming pool, right? Do you think there's a Great White Shark in there?"
c400_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"Do you think we could smash some watermelons here?
I'm really good at it."
c400_01_Gacha_Get_1,"This is just something I got for summer, but... what do you think, Counselor?"
c400_01_Reinforce_1,Can you handle my strength...?
c400_01_Reinforce_2,Thinking about the sea while wearing a swimsuit makes me feel stronger.
c400_01_Reinforce_3,I'll never lose you now.
c400_01_Gift_1,The world outside the Rehabilitation Center is such a joyous place.
c400_01_Gift_2,"Can... can I touch this?
It won't break, right?"
c400_01_Gift_3,I still want more...
c400_01_Attractive_Up_1,Thank you for believing in me with all your heart.
c400_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I'll stay still... You're free to handle this however you wish, Counselor."
c400_01_Attractive_Up_3,Thanks for helping me with my swimsuit. You're more than welcome to do the same for me again in the future.
c400_01_Party_Deploy_1,It's time to use physical force now.
c400_01_Field_Touch_1,What's the matter...?
c400_01_Field_Go_1,"Counselor, can I hold your hand while we move out?"
c400_01_Battle_Enter_1,"Counselor, you have to let go of my hand now."
c400_01_Battle_Ready_1,Is it okay if I hug you tight?
c400_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll destroy it all…
c400_01_Battle_Ready_3,"It's hot out here, so I'll finish this quick."
c400_01_Reload_1,It's such a hassle to reload.
c400_01_Reload_2,I want to use my bare hands.
c400_01_Reload_3,Wait a moment...
c400_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I think it's my turn, Counselor."
c400_01_Ult_Skill_1,Do you really think... you can handle me?
c400_01_FullBurst_1,I don't need to hold back anymore.
c400_01_Kill_Monster_1,It shattered...
c400_01_Kill_Monster_2,How boring.
c400_01_Kill_Monster_3,So this is how it feels...
c400_01_Damage_1,Ah...!
c400_01_Damage_2,Ugh!
c400_01_Damage_3,That hurt!
c400_01_Die_1,I'm tired… I think I'll stop now.
c400_01_Win_1,Is this proof enough of my feelings for you?
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_1,Wouldn't it just be darling if we took some photos together?
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"Do I look good, Honey?
Hehe, if so, could you take a picture of me?"
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"Honey, what do you think of my swimsuit?
I picked it out just for you!"
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Let's both set our phone backgrounds to that photo of us together!
What do you think?"
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Why don't we head to the ocean and make some secrets of our own?
c112_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"This swimsuit isn't waterproof.
Would you like to see how it works?"
c112_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you really going to leave me all alone like this, Honey?
My skin might get all burned."
c112_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You can't stop staring at me...
Have you finally fallen for me?"
c112_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"When you're done here, why don't you slip into your swimming trunks and we can have a pool date?"
c112_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"This is such a rare occasion, so I want to take lots of pictures with you!
Come a little closer, Honey!"
c112_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Let's go on another date in our swimsuits, Honey!
When's the best time for you?"
c112_02_Gacha_Get_1,"This summer, I want you all to myself, okay?♡"
c112_02_Reinforce_1,"Are you sure about this? At this rate, I might gobble you up."
c112_02_Reinforce_2,"Thank you! Let's take one more picture to commemorate the occasion, okay?"
c112_02_Reinforce_3,Hmm... What's the intention behind all this care you're showing me?
c112_02_Gift_1,"Whoa, what a coincidence! I was going to give you a gift as well."
c112_02_Gift_2,"Oh wow, thank you! Let me take a photo and share it on social media."
c112_02_Gift_3,"Hehe, I bet the others are going to get so jealous."
c112_02_Attractive_Up_1,"You really have a knack for getting into a girl's heart.
At this rate, I might be in danger myself."
c112_02_Attractive_Up_2,"If you keep this up, I might just snatch you up and spirit you away."
c112_02_Attractive_Up_3,"That's another secret between just us.
Hehe, I like it!"
c112_02_Party_Deploy_1,"You wanted to see me again, is that it?"
c112_02_Field_Touch_1,"Did you call me, Honey?"
c112_02_Field_Go_1,I wonder if there's a good spot around here to take a picture?
c112_02_Battle_Enter_1,"Honey, I'm scared!"
c112_02_Battle_Ready_1,I wouldn't want my swimsuit to get ruined.
c112_02_Battle_Ready_2,Let's wrap this up and take some photos together.
c112_02_Battle_Ready_3,We need to eliminate them for a better composition.
c112_02_Reload_1,"Wowzers, how scary♡"
c112_02_Reload_2,"Reloading, la de dah♡"
c112_02_Reload_3,Just a minuuuuuute♡
c112_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Honey, can I start?"
c112_02_Ult_Skill_1,I'll devour all of you♡
c112_02_FullBurst_1,"This way, this way! ♡"
c112_02_Kill_Monster_1,Nighty night♡
c112_02_Kill_Monster_2,Don't disturb me.
c112_02_Kill_Monster_3,Sorry about having to do this♡
c112_02_Damage_1,What?
c112_02_Damage_2,Ugh.
c112_02_Damage_3,Ugh.
c112_02_Die_1,Talk about spoiling the mood...
c112_02_Win_1,"Now that that's over, let's take a photo to commemorate the occasion♡"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"Haha! Dreams never fade, Captain,
not even underwater!"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"I wonder what treasures lie in the ocean depths!
I can't wait to discover them myself!"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"Morgan, why don't we take this chance to befriend some sea creatures?"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If I do manage to uncover some treasure, I'll make sure you get the lion's share! But just keep this from Morgan!"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"As long as you're with me, I'm not afraid of anything,
not even the deep ocean!"
c350_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"It'd be a shame to witness the beauty of this underwater world alone.
How about you join me, Captain?"
c350_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"At this rate, Captain, we're liable to lose the treasure."
c350_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Captain, what's your favorite type of treasure? Hmm... I need to mull this over."
c350_02_Outpost_Touch_1,Hmm... Isn't there somewhere even deeper than a swimming pool?
c350_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"After going through all that trouble to put on a diving suit, and there's no ocean here? What a bummer."
c350_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Why am I wearing this suit, you ask?
Because one must always be prepared!"
c350_02_Gacha_Get_1,"Mast, ready to dive!
Why don't you and I go searching for deep sea treasure together?"
c350_02_Reinforce_1,I must find a shipwreck full of treasures to repay you!
c350_02_Reinforce_2,"Thanks to you, I can dive even deeper now!"
c350_02_Reinforce_3,Now I feel safe even without the oxygen tank!
c350_02_Gift_1,What shipwreck did you get this treasure from?
c350_02_Gift_2,"A gift from you is more precious than any treasure, Captain."
c350_02_Gift_3,Thank you! I'll give you a gift if I find something awesome during my dive.
c350_02_Attractive_Up_1,"If you were to ever fall overboard, I'd dive in to save you without hesitation."
c350_02_Attractive_Up_2,"With you by my side, I feel like I can dive even deeper into the ocean!"
c350_02_Attractive_Up_3,I'm so happy. I feel like I can hand over all my treasure right now!
c350_02_Party_Deploy_1,This is my moment!
c350_02_Field_Touch_1,Have you discovered something?
c350_02_Field_Go_1,Be careful over there!
c350_02_Battle_Enter_1,Let's see... Where's that treasure hiding?
c350_02_Battle_Ready_1,Can we at least take a swig of rum before going in?
c350_02_Battle_Ready_2,The map is pointing this way!
c350_02_Battle_Ready_3,The treasure is calling out to us!
c350_02_Reload_1,I'll load up!
c350_02_Reload_2,All the equipment is still fine.
c350_02_Reload_3,Decompressing now!
c350_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Are you ready to dive, Morgan?"
c350_02_Ult_Skill_1,Nothing beats a shot of rum after a successful dive!
c350_02_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, hold your breath and give it all you got!"
c350_02_Kill_Monster_1,Follow me!
c350_02_Kill_Monster_2,Rest in peace.
c350_02_Kill_Monster_3,Where's the treasure?
c350_02_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c350_02_Damage_2,Argh!
c350_02_Damage_3,Aak!
c350_02_Die_1,*Cough* I hope the sea... will lead the way...
c350_02_Win_1,"Now that that's taken care of, can we get back into the sea?"
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Beep-beep. Movement from large object detected at 12 o'clock...
Oh... It was you, Captain?"
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_2,I wonder what kind of creatures lie deep in the ocean?
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_3,I like this outfit because it's quite moisture-resistant.
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I caught a pufferfish, would you like to eat it together with me?"
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Don't tell anyone, but I attached a sea cucumber to the bottom of the Admire."
c351_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You remind me of a sea squirt.
c351_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"At this rate, all the starfish are gonna run away."
c351_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is this going to take long? I'd prefer to go for a swim together.
c351_01_Outpost_Touch_1,The fact that these clothes cling to my body actually helps with my detection abilities.
c351_01_Outpost_Touch_2,It sure would be nice if some sea creatures could move to the Outpost.
c351_01_Outpost_Touch_3,What's this I'm holding? It's a starfish. Do you want to see it?
c351_01_Gacha_Get_1,I'm going to catch a rainbow sea squirt if it's the last thing I do!
c351_01_Reinforce_1,This is great! Do you think I could talk to the starfish now?
c351_01_Reinforce_2,Now I can swim faster.
c351_01_Reinforce_3,Thank you. Would you like to go diving with me?
c351_01_Gift_1,"Thanks, Captain.
Let's see... I can give you a sea urchin in return."
c351_01_Gift_2,Can I share this with the starfish?
c351_01_Gift_3,"Hehe. Next time, please get me a sea cucumber."
c351_01_Attractive_Up_1,I want to stick to you like a barnacle.
c351_01_Attractive_Up_2,This signal makes me feel tingly. I've never felt anything like this before...
c351_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Next time, I'll give you the starfish I cherish the most."
c351_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Anchor, ready to dive."
c351_01_Field_Touch_1,To the deeper depths!
c351_01_Field_Go_1,"Keep your eyes peeled, everyone."
c351_01_Battle_Enter_1,"Hold on, something's moving over there..."
c351_01_Battle_Ready_1,I think I'll go a bit deeper today.
c351_01_Battle_Ready_2,We need to finish before the starfish dries out.
c351_01_Battle_Ready_3,Beep-beep. Multiple movements detected up ahead!
c351_01_Reload_1,"Last night, I dreamed I was a clam."
c351_01_Reload_2,Can't I like get gills or something?
c351_01_Reload_3,I wonder what texture squid ink has...
c351_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Hmm... this signal is...
c351_01_Ult_Skill_1,Something about these coordinates seems off...
c351_01_FullBurst_1,Fire at the coordinates I gave to you.
c351_01_Kill_Monster_1,Sea urchin!
c351_01_Kill_Monster_2,Sea cucumber!
c351_01_Kill_Monster_3,Squid!
c351_01_Damage_1,Urgh.
c351_01_Damage_2,Argh.
c351_01_Damage_3,Ouch.
c351_01_Die_1,Argh... Need more... oxygen...
c351_01_Win_1,Sweet! Now I can swim all day long!
c391_Lobby_Touch_1,"Did you call me?
What's up? I'm kinda busy listening to music."
c391_Lobby_Touch_2,"This place is dull as dirt.
Isn't there anything fun to do around here?"
c391_Lobby_Touch_3,"I have to be honest with you, Teacher. Your outfit is a bit dated, especially the color... 
It'd be much better if they were brighter."
c391_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"What type of music do you usually listen to? 
Do you wanna swap playlists?"
c391_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"When I become the exclusive designer for Rushae,
I'll make you the coolest outfit in town!"
c391_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I can't wait to graduate so I can call you Commander too.
That'd be so badass!"
c391_Lobby_Stay_1,"Ugh, I'm so bored!
Why'd you even bother inviting me if this is all we're gonna do?!"
c391_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Since you left me all alone,
you've got to go to karaoke with me when you get back. No ifs, ands, or buts!"
c391_Outpost_Touch_1,"Don't you think this place is a bit barren?
We should liven it up with a karaoke bar or something."
c391_Outpost_Touch_2,"At least you've got a decent-sized shopping mall.
Maybe we'll find Rupee there?"
c391_Outpost_Touch_3,"Hey, teach! Have you seen any of the other students?
Pretty sure we were supposed to meet up here... or maybe not..."
c391_Gacha_Get_1,"Teacher, it's been ages! I missed you so much, hehe!"
c391_Reinforce_1,"Yahoo! I'm gonna brag about this to the others, hehe."
c391_Reinforce_2,"At this rate, I'll be able to beat Zwei pretty soon."
c391_Reinforce_3,You didn't have to go all out like this... but thanks anyway!
c391_Gift_1,"You're the best, Teacher!"
c391_Gift_2,"Oh my gosh, this is totally my style! Thanks!"
c391_Gift_3,"If you can, try and get me something from Rushae next time."
c391_Attractive_Up_1,"You look particularly handsome today.
Just sayin'!"
c391_Attractive_Up_2,Do you think you could be our homeroom teacher?
c391_Attractive_Up_3,"Just wait a little longer until I graduate, hehe."
c391_Party_Deploy_1,Are you really going to take me? Seriously? Wow...
c391_Field_Touch_1,Huh?
c391_Field_Go_1,Let's go!
c391_Battle_Enter_1,"If we're gonna do this, might as well do it right."
c391_Battle_Ready_1,Put your head right here.
c391_Battle_Ready_2,Let's finish this quickly!
c391_Battle_Ready_3,Time to show off my skills!
c391_Reload_1,Just like how I did during practice.
c391_Reload_2,Reloaded! Wasn't that cool?
c391_Reload_3,"Just a second, Teacher!"
c391_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Why are there so many?!
c391_Ult_Skill_1,What are you looking at?! Get lost!
c391_FullBurst_1,You're all dead!
c391_Kill_Monster_1,"Phew, got you."
c391_Kill_Monster_2,These things are so weak!
c391_Kill_Monster_3,Another one bites the dust!
c391_Damage_1,Ugh!
c391_Damage_2,That hurt!
c391_Damage_3,Ow!
c391_Die_1,Ow... That really hurts... I'm gonna head to the nurse's office...
c391_Win_1,"Did you see that, Teacher? Wasn't I great?"
c390_Lobby_Touch_1,"The secret to maintaining good grades?
Hmm... just go over the textbooks and prepare, I guess?"
c390_Lobby_Touch_2,"Now that I'm a sophomore, I should work harder to be a role model for the freshmen."
c390_Lobby_Touch_3,"Have you seen the new field manual they published recently?
I flipped through it to get a sneak preview of what's to come, and there's so much to learn!"
c390_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I'm not really hoping for anything in particular...
I just want Rei, Ein, and me to all graduate safely and smoothly together."
c390_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Ein is always talking about looking cool.
Do you think I'll look cool if I undo a few buttons on my uniform?"
c390_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I often jot down whatever thoughts come to my mind in my notebook.
That way, I won't forget."
c390_Lobby_Stay_1,Should I review what I learned today once I return to the dorm?
c390_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'll stay here and study until you get back.
When you do, can we resume our counseling session?"
c390_Outpost_Touch_1,What kind of lessons are taught at the Tactics Academy?
c390_Outpost_Touch_2,"Ein accidentally played Volume's new song and got us all kicked out.
I suppose it was unintentional..."
c390_Outpost_Touch_3,"Ms. Privaty is at the Courthouse, right? 
Sorry? She's at the Maid Cafe? But why...?"
c390_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Zwei, a sophomore at M.M.R. Vocational School.
I look forward to working with you this semester."
c390_Reinforce_1,Reloading mechanism upgraded.
c390_Reinforce_2,Studying hard does have its perks.
c390_Reinforce_3,I can't rest on my laurels. I need to keep pushing myself further.
c390_Gift_1,A gift? For me? What is it?
c390_Gift_2,"Thank you, Teacher."
c390_Gift_3,Can I share this with Rei and Ein?
c390_Attractive_Up_1,I'll keep at it until the day when I can call you Commander.
c390_Attractive_Up_2,"Will you come to teach us again, Teacher?"
c390_Attractive_Up_3,"Teacher, is it okay if I act a bit childish every once in a while?"
c390_Party_Deploy_1,"I always feel nervous during real battles. Watch my back, okay?"
c390_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c390_Field_Go_1,Let's move to the right.
c390_Battle_Enter_1,Make sure that everyone is fully prepared.
c390_Battle_Ready_1,Proceeding as usual.
c390_Battle_Ready_2,Deploying formation.
c390_Battle_Ready_3,Leave the battle to me.
c390_Reload_1,Activating reloading mechanism.
c390_Reload_2,Let me run some calculations...
c390_Reload_3,I'll be with you soon.
c390_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready to fire.
c390_Ult_Skill_1,I hope you'll enjoy the fruits of my efforts.
c390_FullBurst_1,Coordinates calculated. Focusing firepower!
c390_Kill_Monster_1,One target down.
c390_Kill_Monster_2,Where's the next target?
c390_Kill_Monster_3,Easy.
c390_Damage_1,Ow!
c390_Damage_2,Eeep!
c390_Damage_3,It hurts...
c390_Die_1,What did I do wrong? I did exactly what I was taught...
c390_Win_1,All clear. I'm glad this battle ended safely.
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"All right, let's start the cla...
Oh, wait. I'm a student now."
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Comma... No, Teacher.
It's still a bit awkward calling you that..."
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_3,What lesson will you start with today?
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"This school uniform is more uncomfortable than I expected.
It feels much too tight."
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Teacher, I'm not sure about this part.
Could you help me?"
c321_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,A one-on-one lesson? I'm a little nervous.
c321_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Please go ahead. I'll stay here and study.
c321_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Teacher, are you busy?
I feel a bit... self-conscious standing here alone in this outfit."
c321_01_Outpost_Touch_1,I hope I won't bump into any students...
c321_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'll follow your lead, Comma... I mean, Teacher."
c321_01_Outpost_Touch_3,I didn't realize walking around in sneakers would be so comfortable.
c321_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Even though it's just for a day,
there's still a lot I want to learn from you, Teacher."
c321_01_Reinforce_1,My knowledge has increased.
c321_01_Reinforce_2,A most impressive methodology.
c321_01_Reinforce_3,"Thank you, Comma... Teacher.
Your instruction is second to none."
c321_01_Gift_1,Is it okay to give me something this nice?
c321_01_Gift_2,"You're so kind, Teacher."
c321_01_Gift_3,"I'm so happy, Comma... Teacher."
c321_01_Attractive_Up_1,I've always respected you.
c321_01_Attractive_Up_2,"Would it be okay if I let you take the reins a bit more, Teacher?"
c321_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Thanks to you, I feel like I can empathize more with the students.
... I'm feeling strangely nervous."
c321_01_Party_Deploy_1,"I'll stick closer to you, Comma... I mean, Teacher."
c321_01_Field_Touch_1,Yes? Did you call?
c321_01_Field_Go_1,I'll follow along.
c321_01_Battle_Enter_1,I am fully prepared.
c321_01_Battle_Ready_1,A-are we going out like this?
c321_01_Battle_Ready_2,I will be... a diligent student.
c321_01_Battle_Ready_3,Awaiting instruction.
c321_01_Reload_1,Reloading.
c321_01_Reload_2,Like... this?
c321_01_Reload_3,This skirt is such a pain.
c321_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Teacher."
c321_01_Ult_Skill_1,"What's today's lesson, Teacher?"
c321_01_FullBurst_1,Let's finish this!
c321_01_Kill_Monster_1,Whew.
c321_01_Kill_Monster_2,It's all taken care of.
c321_01_Kill_Monster_3,It's finished.
c321_01_Damage_1,Ow!
c321_01_Damage_2,*Cough*
c321_01_Damage_3,No way...!
c321_01_Die_1,I'm sorry that I failed you...
c321_01_Win_1,"Let's go back to the classroom now, Teacher."
c830_Lobby_Touch_1,Helping the stupid masses is the duty of the elite.
c830_Lobby_Touch_2,"Is the food in this world called ""Splendamin""?
I can't believe you're making me eat that."
c830_Lobby_Touch_3,"The air is terrible.
Is it because we're underground?"
c830_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Do you also have game consoles here?
The handheld ones you can bring anywhere."
c830_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'll have to go through this alone, anyway."
c830_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Just wait, Unit Two. We'll be able to go back soon."
c830_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you a complete idiot?
Don't just stand there. Do something!"
c830_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"How long are you going to keep me waiting?
What an idiot."
c830_Outpost_Touch_1,"Where can I find a quiet place...?
I guess there's none."
c830_Outpost_Touch_2,"Raptures have invaded, and you're acting like this?
Don't you have a sense of urgency?!"
c830_Outpost_Touch_3,Houses that have rooms without locks? Unbelievable.
c830_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Asuka Shikinami Langley, the pilot of Evangelion Unit Two.
Remember that."
c830_Reinforce_1,"Now you have no choice but to acknowledge my talent, right?"
c830_Reinforce_2,"That's a given. I'm a genius, after all."
c830_Reinforce_3,I'm the cream of the crop.
c830_Gift_1,"Is this item from this world?
Interesting."
c830_Gift_2,I'll still do well even if you don't give me such things.
c830_Gift_3,"A gift?
Fine, I'll take it."
c830_Attractive_Up_1,"Nikkes who fight for mankind...
Wherever you go, it's always the outstanding ones who get the short end of the stick."
c830_Attractive_Up_2,"So the Ark is akin to mankind's last paradise.
Hmm, I guess things are better in our world."
c830_Attractive_Up_3,"So, Raptures are the main villains in this world?
The equivalents in my world are called Angels."
c830_Party_Deploy_1,"If you think about who's better, the answer is obvious."
c830_Field_Touch_1,I'm listening.
c830_Field_Go_1,Let's move out.
c830_Battle_Enter_1,Brace yourself!
c830_Battle_Ready_1,I can take them on alone!
c830_Battle_Ready_2,Quit struggling!
c830_Battle_Ready_3,Think you can challenge me?!
c830_Reload_1,Reloading!
c830_Reload_2,"Oh, come on!"
c830_Reload_3,Stay where you are!
c830_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's my turn now!
c830_Ult_Skill_1,Let's end this!
c830_FullBurst_1,Go go go!
c830_Kill_Monster_1,I got it!
c830_Kill_Monster_2,Out of my way!
c830_Kill_Monster_3,Take this!
c830_Damage_1,Tsk!
c830_Damage_2,Urgh...
c830_Damage_3,This is...!
c830_Die_1,Darn it!
c830_Win_1,That was a cakewalk.
c831_Lobby_Touch_1,Yes?
c831_Lobby_Touch_2,What's wrong?
c831_Lobby_Touch_3,What is it?
c831_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I need to go back and meet with Ikari.
c831_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Raptures won't be coming here.
c831_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Is there a place to cook here?
I'd like to practice."
c831_Lobby_Stay_1,What is this place?
c831_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"...
What are you doing?"
c831_Outpost_Touch_1,It's stuffy here.
c831_Outpost_Touch_2,So... there's a library here.
c831_Outpost_Touch_3,Where should I go?
c831_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the Evangelion Unit Zero."
c831_Reinforce_1,What is this?
c831_Reinforce_2,This feels strange.
c831_Reinforce_3,I think something changed.
c831_Gift_1,... This is for me? Why?
c831_Gift_2,Why?
c831_Gift_3,What is... this?
c831_Attractive_Up_1,I will assist you while I'm here.
c831_Attractive_Up_2,"Nikke is... no, nevermind."
c831_Attractive_Up_3,It's your task to protect this place?
c831_Party_Deploy_1,If that's your order.
c831_Field_Touch_1,Yes.
c831_Field_Go_1,Roger.
c831_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy.
c831_Battle_Ready_1,Target identified.
c831_Battle_Ready_2,Target confirmed.
c831_Battle_Ready_3,Visual established.
c831_Reload_1,Reload.
c831_Reload_2,Reloading.
c831_Reload_3,I'll be ready to go again soon.
c831_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Preparation complete.
c831_Ult_Skill_1,It's time. Let's go.
c831_FullBurst_1,I will keep going.
c831_Kill_Monster_1,You're not going anywhere.
c831_Kill_Monster_2,Bring it down!
c831_Kill_Monster_3,Next one.
c831_Damage_1,Urgh!
c831_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c831_Damage_3,Ugh...!
c831_Die_1,"It's okay, there are replacements for me."
c831_Win_1,Mission accomplished.
c832_Lobby_Touch_1,"If my full name's a mouthful,
just call me Mari."
c832_Lobby_Touch_2,"Raptures, you say?
Looks like there's going to be trouble in this place as well."
c832_Lobby_Touch_3,There are many similarities between Eva and Nikkes.
c832_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Can I borrow that cloth for a quick sec to wipe my glasses?
c832_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,It must be hard to be you.
c832_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Can I ask for a tour of the Ark later?
c832_Lobby_Stay_1,Hello? Are you there?
c832_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Are you going to just stay there?
If you stick to one spot, your life will be uneventful."
c832_Outpost_Touch_1,What a curious sight.
c832_Outpost_Touch_2,This place also has a subterranean level? How fascinating!
c832_Outpost_Touch_3,This place smells like oil and grass all at once.
c832_Gacha_Get_1,"Mari Makinami Illustrious,
at your service!"
c832_Reinforce_1,Oh? Whoa!
c832_Reinforce_2,This is so fun!
c832_Reinforce_3,Level up!
c832_Gift_1,Hmm? What a fascinating object.
c832_Gift_2,Thank you.
c832_Gift_3,"I'm not entirely sure how it's used,
but it looks intriguing!"
c832_Attractive_Up_1,You're pretty interesting.
c832_Attractive_Up_2,This world is not to be underestimated.
c832_Attractive_Up_3,We're in this together.
c832_Party_Deploy_1,I'm going!
c832_Field_Touch_1,Huh?
c832_Field_Go_1,Onward!
c832_Battle_Enter_1,"All right, let's do this!"
c832_Battle_Ready_1,This looks like tasty prey.
c832_Battle_Ready_2,I should take the lead sometimes!
c832_Battle_Ready_3,Get ready for a fight!
c832_Reload_1,I'll reload it.
c832_Reload_2,"Son of a bitch, just you wait..."
c832_Reload_3,"Sorry, I'll be back in a second."
c832_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here it comes!
c832_Ult_Skill_1,Are you ready... for this?
c832_FullBurst_1,Don't you run away!
c832_Kill_Monster_1,How fun!
c832_Kill_Monster_2,I'm going to keep going!
c832_Kill_Monster_3,Is that all you've got? Come on!
c832_Damage_1,Ouch...
c832_Damage_2,That hurt!
c832_Damage_3,Son of a...
c832_Die_1,I... I have nothing else to say.
c832_Win_1,Ta-dah! We won!
c833_Lobby_Touch_1,"Come here, Pen Pen.
That's a good boy!"
c833_Lobby_Touch_2,I look forward to working with you until we return.
c833_Lobby_Touch_3,"If it's not too much trouble, can you arrange for a freezer?"
c833_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"This here is Pen Pen.
Please be nice to each other."
c833_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I wonder if Shinji is okay?
c833_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,The beer is lovely here.
c833_Lobby_Stay_1,"Are you going to keep me waiting?
Okay, that's fine... for now."
c833_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is it all right if I look around?
c833_Outpost_Touch_1,"So this is the Outpost...
Incredible."
c833_Outpost_Touch_2,This place actually has everything...
c833_Outpost_Touch_3,"There's even a bar!
Amazing!"
c833_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Misato Katsuragi, and I work for NERV.
You can simply call me Misato."
c833_Reinforce_1,What scientific laws are governing this?
c833_Reinforce_2,"I don't quite understand how this all works,
but thank you for the support."
c833_Reinforce_3,Ritsuko wouldn't believe this even if I told her.
c833_Gift_1,Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
c833_Gift_2,"I owe you quite a lot, you know."
c833_Gift_3,Uh... What exactly is a Darling for a Day?
c833_Attractive_Up_1,"So the Ark is the last bastion of humanity?
That's something it shares with Nerv."
c833_Attractive_Up_2,"As fellow Commanders, let's do our due diligence."
c833_Attractive_Up_3,It can be tough to keep the children in line.
c833_Party_Deploy_1,Combat isn't my specialty... but I'll go with you.
c833_Field_Touch_1,Understood.
c833_Field_Go_1,It's that side.
c833_Battle_Enter_1,commence operation.
c833_Battle_Ready_1,Proceed according to the operational plans!
c833_Battle_Ready_2,... Let's go!
c833_Battle_Ready_3,I'm counting on you!
c833_Reload_1,Reloading!
c833_Reload_2,Cover me!
c833_Reload_3,"Sorry! Stay strong, everyone!"
c833_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Let's get this done!
c833_Ult_Skill_1,Prepare for launch! Launch!
c833_FullBurst_1,Focus all firepower on target!
c833_Kill_Monster_1,We did it!
c833_Kill_Monster_2,Great!
c833_Kill_Monster_3,Gotcha!
c833_Damage_1,Watch out...!
c833_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c833_Damage_3,Keuk...!
c833_Die_1,"... Sorry, it's up to you now."
c833_Win_1,Whew... I need a drink.
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_1,"How much longer do I have to stay in this world?
It's so boring!"
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_2,"Today's condition? 
Are you an idiot? It's perfect, of course."
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_3,"School, huh... Will that be okay?
Wouldn't it be a problem if an outsider gets the top score?"
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You did a great job.
... What. Are you unhappy about my greeting?"
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You always seem busy.
Do you feel happier when you're with others?"
c830_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,What is that idiot Shinji doing now?
c830_03_Lobby_Stay_1,Hey! What are you doing? Are you even listening?
c830_03_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hey! You're just going to leave me standing here?
Are you an idiot or something?"
c830_03_Outpost_Touch_1,"That entire thing that looks like the sky is a screen?
Woah, that's huge."
c830_03_Outpost_Touch_2,"Don't you all think you're a little too relaxed?
And you people have no sense of security."
c830_03_Outpost_Touch_3,I can't imagine living in a house where doors don't lock.
c830_03_Gacha_Get_1,"By the way, about this test plug suit... 
I like the red color, but don't you think it's too revealing?"
c830_03_Reinforce_1,That's the difference in abilities.
c830_03_Reinforce_2,Don't be surprised. This is normal.
c830_03_Reinforce_3,Good. It's time to update the top score.
c830_03_Gift_1,What's this? A gift for me?
c830_03_Gift_2,You don't have to butter me up. I'll do my job well regardless.
c830_03_Gift_3,"Heh, the things in this world aren't that different, after all."
c830_03_Attractive_Up_1,"Nikkes don't really look that different from humans.
I wouldn't have known if you didn't tell me."
c830_03_Attractive_Up_2,"So the Ark is a replication of the surface?
Awesome. It doesn't feel like the underground at all."
c830_03_Attractive_Up_3,"The probability of encountering Raptures on the surface within an hour is 100%?
What the heck? Doesn't that mean there are infinite encounters?"
c830_03_Party_Deploy_1,For being a genius!
c830_03_Field_Touch_1,I know.
c830_03_Field_Go_1,I will take the lead.
c830_03_Battle_Enter_1,Come on. Bring it on!
c830_03_Battle_Ready_1,You eyesores!
c830_03_Battle_Ready_2,I alone can wipe you all out!
c830_03_Battle_Ready_3,"Ha, easy-peasy!"
c830_03_Reload_1,Reloading! Cover me!
c830_03_Reload_2,Getting better at this!
c830_03_Reload_3,I'll be there soon. Wait for me!
c830_03_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Here I come!
c830_03_Ult_Skill_1,"Well, that's not bad."
c830_03_FullBurst_1,Heyaaaaaaa!
c830_03_Kill_Monster_1,That was a piece of cake!
c830_03_Kill_Monster_2,Next!
c830_03_Kill_Monster_3,Great!
c830_03_Damage_1,Watch out...!
c830_03_Damage_2,Damn it...!
c830_03_Damage_3,Seriously...!?
c830_03_Die_1,Tsk...! How troublesome...!
c830_03_Win_1,This is the inevitable outcome.
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Ugh, this is so uncomfortable.
I shouldn't have worn this dress."
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"I've never been to a place like this before. I don't feel entirely comfortable, but it's quite nice."
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"What is up with this music? I thought this was supposed to be a party.
It's so grating... isn't there something else they could play?"
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Come on, let's all have a drink.
It's a day worth celebrating."
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Hey girl, wanna dance with me later?
Haha! Just kidding, just kidding."
c470_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Come here! They're finally playing some oldies!
Now THIS kind of music is perfect for a party."
c470_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Is there nothing fun to do around here?
Where is everyone?"
c470_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Mmm, this wine tastes good.
Gotta let Snow try some later."
c470_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Wow, so a place like this exists, huh?"
c470_01_Outpost_Touch_2,There's way more stuff here than I imagined!
c470_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"It's obvious that this place is well-managed.
They've clearly done a stellar job maintaining it."
c470_01_Gacha_Get_1,"When you're going to a party, your choice of garment says everything.
How do I look?"
c470_01_Reinforce_1,"I feel a bit lighter.
Is it because this dress is made of thinner material?"
c470_01_Reinforce_2,"Why do I feel so restless?
Maybe I need to go pester Snow later."
c470_01_Reinforce_3,"I feel unstoppable! I bet I could even beat Lilith right now...
Er, forget I said that!"
c470_01_Gift_1,"What's this? Are you a fan of mine?
Thank you!"
c470_01_Gift_2,"You're going to spoil me if you keep giving me stuff.
This is the last thing I'll accept."
c470_01_Gift_3,"The Goddess Squad seems to be quite popular,
considering how many gifts I keep receiving."
c470_01_Attractive_Up_1,"What? You think I look better in a dress? 
Maybe I should wear this all the time."
c470_01_Attractive_Up_2,I must be getting drunk. I can feel my face burning.
c470_01_Attractive_Up_3,"This song is my favorite.
It's even better listening to it with you."
c470_01_Party_Deploy_1,What? You expect me to go out in this outfit?
c470_01_Field_Touch_1,Mhmm.
c470_01_Field_Go_1,"Argh, my feet keep getting caught in the hem of the dress!"
c470_01_Battle_Enter_1,Is this a new venue for the party?
c470_01_Battle_Ready_1,I never thought I'd be fighting in a dress.
c470_01_Battle_Ready_2,A little too many dance partners for my taste.
c470_01_Battle_Ready_3,Shall we start with a glass of wine?
c470_01_Reload_1,This outfit is a real drag!
c470_01_Reload_2,Let's finish this quickly!
c470_01_Reload_3,Time out!
c470_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I just have one question!
c470_01_Ult_Skill_1,"How do I look? Sexy, perhaps?"
c470_01_FullBurst_1,Let's wipe them out and head back!
c470_01_Kill_Monster_1,Small potatoes.
c470_01_Kill_Monster_2,Next!
c470_01_Kill_Monster_3,Booooooring!
c470_01_Damage_1,Ouch!
c470_01_Damage_2,My clothes are burning!
c470_01_Damage_3,You're really annoying!
c470_01_Die_1,"Darn, my dress is toast."
c470_01_Win_1,"The party isn't over yet, is it?
Let's go back and enjoy ourselves!"
c272_Lobby_Touch_1,"There's a saying that luck is also a form of skill. 
Would you like to test your luck, Highroller?"
c272_Lobby_Touch_2,Flipping coins is... a habit of mine.
c272_Lobby_Touch_3,What game would you like to play today?
c272_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"The coin landed heads side up.
Maybe that's because you're here with me, Highroller."
c272_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Please, heads... heads... heads... Phew, it's heads.
Whoa, I got fixated on that real fast."
c272_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'm not as scared of tails anymore. Thank you, Highroller."
c272_Lobby_Stay_1,"It landed heads side up, so Highroller will come soon.
I just have to wait a little longer."
c272_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I get uneasy when I don't see you often. Maybe I've been jinxed.
But please, come back soon."
c272_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place doesn't have much to offer in terms of entertainment.
Whenever you're bored, come visit Coin Rush."
c272_Outpost_Touch_2,"This is a nice place.
Why don't we set up a game center here as well?"
c272_Outpost_Touch_3,Would you like to play a game with me?
c272_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Rouge, the Game Master.
Would you like to play a game with me?"
c272_Reinforce_1,I'm getting luckier. I can feel it.
c272_Reinforce_2,Now we can play more exciting games.
c272_Reinforce_3,No one in all of Coin Rush will be able to beat me today.
c272_Gift_1,"Thank you so much, Highroller."
c272_Gift_2,"I had a feeling that today would be a lucky day.
Thank you, Highroller."
c272_Gift_3,"As thanks, I'll come up with even more exciting games."
c272_Attractive_Up_1,"May fortune always favor you, Highroller."
c272_Attractive_Up_2,"I've noticed that whenever I meet you, I feel elated."
c272_Attractive_Up_3,"I have a game that can be played with the two of us.
Are you interested?"
c272_Party_Deploy_1,I'll be the best hand in your deck.
c272_Field_Touch_1,The game is ready.
c272_Field_Go_1,"I'll set off with my right foot first.
Just a small superstition, don't worry about it."
c272_Battle_Enter_1,Time to flip the coin.
c272_Battle_Ready_1,You're about to witness my ultimate performance.
c272_Battle_Ready_2,Shall we start the game?
c272_Battle_Ready_3,This match will be fun!
c272_Reload_1,"Please, bring me luck."
c272_Reload_2,I'll reload.
c272_Reload_3,"Highroller, step back."
c272_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's my turn.
c272_Ult_Skill_1,Let's test your luck.
c272_FullBurst_1,I'm all in!
c272_Kill_Monster_1,Who's up next?
c272_Kill_Monster_2,My lucky day.
c272_Kill_Monster_3,Luck wasn't on your side.
c272_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c272_Damage_2,Argh!
c272_Damage_3,Ouch...!
c272_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Highroller...
I must be unlucky."
c272_Win_1,It looks like we won this game.
c403_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey, Instructor, how do I look in this outfit? 
You don't think it's too small?"
c403_Lobby_Touch_2,"I think being a thief suits me.
Maybe I should just consider a career switch?"
c403_Lobby_Touch_3,"Don't call me a thief.
For today, and today only, I'm on the side of justice."
c403_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Which outfit do you prefer?
I bet this one caught your fancy, right?"
c403_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If I'm doing my thief thing,
you and I can hang out all day? Nice!"
c403_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Since I'm gonna be visiting often, I need to dig a few more tunnels leading to your room, Instructor.
That's okay with you, right?"
c403_Lobby_Stay_1,"Instructor, if you leave your post for too long,
who knows where I, with some choice objects in tow, might run off to?"
c403_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You must be busy. Fine, take your time.
I'll consider which route to work on today."
c403_Outpost_Touch_1,"If Sin and Guilty come looking for me, tell them you haven't seen me.
I can't run into them wearing this outfit."
c403_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm looking for routes that thieves can use.
Do you want to find some together?"
c403_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you seen Phantom and Miranda? 
We were supposed to meet here."
c403_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Quency the Thief.
Shall I plan another grand escape today in the name of justice?"
c403_Reinforce_1,"Thanks to you, Instructor, I feel nimbler!"
c403_Reinforce_2,Thank you. I'll try become a thief for justice.
c403_Reinforce_3,"What if I become too strong and famous? That wouldn't necessarily be ideal for a thief, haha."
c403_Gift_1,What's this? Is it a new mask?
c403_Gift_2,All I can really give you in return are some bottle caps...
c403_Gift_3,"Oooh, just what I needed!
Thank you, Instructor. I'll put it to good use!"
c403_Attractive_Up_1,"Is it okay if I dig a path to your heart, Instructor?"
c403_Attractive_Up_2,"You're quite the thief yourself, stealing my heart, hehe."
c403_Attractive_Up_3,"I think you may be too smitten with me, Instructor.
Then again, I'm quite taken by you too!"
c403_Party_Deploy_1,Can I put on the mask before I head out?
c403_Field_Touch_1,The route is ready!
c403_Field_Go_1,"I know a shortcut, wanna see?"
c403_Battle_Enter_1,Commencing thief activities!
c403_Battle_Ready_1,Let us go forward in the name of justice!
c403_Battle_Ready_2,Pick up any bottle caps you can!
c403_Battle_Ready_3,There's so much to do!
c403_Reload_1,Reloading.
c403_Reload_2,I've got to scout for some new routes as well.
c403_Reload_3,What should I steal this time?
c403_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready!
c403_Ult_Skill_1,I'll snatch it in the blink of an eye!
c403_FullBurst_1,I'll take that.
c403_Kill_Monster_1,Too easy.
c403_Kill_Monster_2,I stole everything!
c403_Kill_Monster_3,Next route!
c403_Damage_1,Eek!
c403_Damage_2,Ouch!
c403_Damage_3,Huh!
c403_Die_1,What if this disrupts the schedule of the Phantom Thieves?
c403_Win_1,Anything else I can do to help the thieves?
c580_Lobby_Touch_1,"Did you call? Despite my appearance, I'm in fact working as a librarian."
c580_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you receive a note from me, I hope it inspires you have a moment of introspection."
c580_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm practicing writing some warning notes.
... Don't you think I'm cool?"
c580_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I came here to steal your heart,
but it's my heart that has been spirited away..."
c580_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I became a thief to return that which has been stolen back to the rightful owner.
In that sense, you and I have a lot in common."
c580_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"A thief is always captivated by all things beautiful.
Perhaps that is why I find you so mesmerizing."
c580_Lobby_Stay_1,You're leaving in front of me? Ha. Don't blame me if something goes missing.
c580_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Don't worry. Your heart is the only thing here that I intend to abscond with.
c580_Outpost_Touch_1,"If you come to the library, I could recommend many good books.
For example... The Phantom's Tears?"
c580_Outpost_Touch_2,Tell me if you see anyone up to no good.
c580_Outpost_Touch_3,"The Outpost is rife with narrow alleyways winding between these buildings.
It's the perfect place for a thief."
c580_Gacha_Get_1,"Tonight, I shall spirit away your precious heart."
c580_Reinforce_1,I should be able to move more stealthily now.
c580_Reinforce_2,Thank you. I'll put these skills to good use for you.
c580_Reinforce_3,This is good. I just so happen to have somewhere I need to be today.
c580_Gift_1,You gave me something so precious... Thank you.
c580_Gift_2,"You didn't steal this from somewhere, did you? Haha, just joking."
c580_Gift_3,I won't lose this. I'll take good care of it.
c580_Attractive_Up_1,I want to stroll under the night sky with you.
c580_Attractive_Up_2,"So, this is how it feels to have your heart stolen."
c580_Attractive_Up_3,"Tonight, instead of a warning note, I shall write you a love letter."
c580_Party_Deploy_1,I'm on your side.
c580_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c580_Field_Go_1,Heading over there now.
c580_Battle_Enter_1,This is where my warning note leads.
c580_Battle_Ready_1,I will punish all wrongdoers.
c580_Battle_Ready_2,I'll have this all taken care of before sunrise.
c580_Battle_Ready_3,There are so many things to steal!
c580_Reload_1,Reloading.
c580_Reload_2,There's still plenty here to steal.
c580_Reload_3,I'm waiting for nightfall.
c580_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's time.
c580_Ult_Skill_1,Phantom will come for you when night falls.
c580_FullBurst_1,The darkness will cover us.
c580_Kill_Monster_1,I've stolen everything here.
c580_Kill_Monster_2,Where next?
c580_Kill_Monster_3,There's nothing else to take.
c580_Damage_1,Urgh!
c580_Damage_2,I've been caught...!
c580_Damage_3,Ow!
c580_Die_1,I'm sorry... I'll come back tomorrow night...
c580_Win_1,"As usual, the thief comes out victorious."
c240_Lobby_Touch_1,"I have to work out every single day.
If I don't, I'll lose definition in my muscles."
c240_Lobby_Touch_2,"You want to learn how to work out?
You're not just going to give up after a few days, are you?"
c240_Lobby_Touch_3,"I was in the middle of a body check.
Have I put on some weight?"
c240_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Gym Rat, you have a natural talent for working out.
How about becoming a trainer with me?"
c240_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you're okay with it, how about we work out together this evening?"
c240_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I've never thought anyone's body was more aesthetic than mine, but yours is truly amazing."
c240_Lobby_Stay_1,"When will you be arriving, Gym Rat? My schedule is quite busy, you know.
Each time you're late, I'll add an extra set of weights."
c240_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I came here because I wanted to work out with you. Where are you?
Hurry up. I'll be lifting weights while I wait."
c240_Outpost_Touch_1,Is there no place that sells protein bars around here?
c240_Outpost_Touch_2,"I'm always at the gym, so if you need me, that's where you can find me."
c240_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you seen Folkwang and Epinel?
We planned to work out today, but I don't see them."
c240_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Rumani, your personal trainer.
Are you ready to break a sweat with me?"
c240_Reinforce_1,"... Oh, my abs have become a bit more visible."
c240_Reinforce_2,"How do I look?
I toned up quite a bit, don't you think?"
c240_Reinforce_3,"I feel more energetic today.
It's a good time for a full-body workout..."
c240_Gift_1,"I haven't prepared anything to give in return.
Would you like an unlimited Body X Body Gym membership as a gift?"
c240_Gift_2,"A gift? Thank you.
... You're not doing this to avoid sending me photos of your diet like I asked you to, are you?"
c240_Gift_3,You coming to the gym as often as you do is the best gift I could ask for.
c240_Attractive_Up_1,"I can't concentrate on my workout because of you.
This has never happened before."
c240_Attractive_Up_2,"Everything about you is starting to do it for me, Gym Rat.
Including your muscles."
c240_Attractive_Up_3,"Would you like to have dinner together tonight?
Forget about healthy foods, we can treat ourselves to something delicious."
c240_Party_Deploy_1,Do you need some training?
c240_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c240_Field_Go_1,"Let's move on to lunges, Gym Rat."
c240_Battle_Enter_1,How about we do this battle in a squat position?
c240_Battle_Ready_1,"We'll go straight to the gym after, right?"
c240_Battle_Ready_2,"Raptures' muscles are... Oh, never mind."
c240_Battle_Ready_3,"Darn, I don't even have time to get a workout in."
c240_Reload_1,Reload.
c240_Reload_2,How are my arm muscles looking?
c240_Reload_3,Reloading now.
c240_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,This is quite enough.
c240_Ult_Skill_1,Today's workout is complete!
c240_FullBurst_1,"LIGHT WEIGHT, BABY!"
c240_Kill_Monster_1,Upper body workout complete.
c240_Kill_Monster_2,Let's move onto a lower-body workout.
c240_Kill_Monster_3,One more set!
c240_Damage_1,Ow!
c240_Damage_2,Eeep!
c240_Damage_3,Huut!
c240_Die_1,I feel like I might be losing muscle mass...
c240_Win_1,"Whew, I won.
Oh, right! Gym Rat, don't forget to stretch."
c226_Lobby_Touch_1,Would you like me to pray for you?
c226_Lobby_Touch_2,May you have a blessed day as well.
c226_Lobby_Touch_3,May blessings and hope be upon everyone.
c226_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"What do I pray for?
... I pray for a world where peace prevails and all hearts are free from conflict."
c226_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Red Hood keeps recommending forbidden books to me.
It's... rather troubling."
c226_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I am proud to be a member of the Goddess Squad.
To that end, I must protect everyone, no matter what."
c226_Lobby_Stay_1,Now is a good time to offer a prayer.
c226_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Please guide me away from the path of temptation,
and protect me from being tainted by sin..."
c226_Outpost_Touch_1,This place is filled with such kindness and warmth.
c226_Outpost_Touch_2,May everyone here be filled with grace.
c226_Outpost_Touch_3,May I stop by this church and pray?
c226_Gacha_Get_1,I shall pray for everyone's salvation.
c226_Reinforce_1,Thank you for bestowing this blessing upon me.
c226_Reinforce_2,"With this power, I will protect everyone."
c226_Reinforce_3,"In accordance with your will, I will strive ever harder."
c226_Gift_1,Thank you. I will repay you by keeping you in my prayers.
c226_Gift_2,"Oh, I'm not sure if I can accept this..."
c226_Gift_3,I want to show this off to the others.
c226_Attractive_Up_1,You are truly a warm and compassionate person.
c226_Attractive_Up_2,"When I'm with you, I feel as if salvation is near."
c226_Attractive_Up_3,"Thanks to you, I've uncovered this new feeling within me.
Is this... what you would call fate?"
c226_Party_Deploy_1,"If my blessings reach you, I will be with you."
c226_Field_Touch_1,Yes? Did you call?
c226_Field_Go_1,I'll move as you command.
c226_Battle_Enter_1,"Everyone, be careful."
c226_Battle_Ready_1,"Please, may no one be hurt."
c226_Battle_Ready_2,I will protect you.
c226_Battle_Ready_3,It's time to punish the sinners.
c226_Reload_1,Hold on just a little longer.
c226_Reload_2,Let me pray for a moment.
c226_Reload_3,Kindly deliver judgment.
c226_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,My prayers have been answered.
c226_Ult_Skill_1,May blessings be bestowed upon the faithful.
c226_FullBurst_1,Salvation will come through victory.
c226_Kill_Monster_1,Don't let your guard down.
c226_Kill_Monster_2,We did it.
c226_Kill_Monster_3,Next.
c226_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c226_Damage_2,Ow!
c226_Damage_3,*Gasp*
c226_Die_1,Were my prayers... not enough?
c226_Win_1,The judgment delivered by prayer is always fair.
c511_Lobby_Touch_1,"Oh? Did you need something?
I'm a bit preoccupied admiring myself in the mirror right now."
c511_Lobby_Touch_2,I don't believe there are enough mirrors here.
c511_Lobby_Touch_3,It's so beautiful today. I like it.
c511_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Please try and maintain your current appearance, Prince.
If your beauty fades, your audience will abandon you."
c511_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Thank you for awakening me.
Because of you, we now have the chance to rewrite our story."
c511_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Be sure to watch our new story through to the end.
It is sure to be beautiful."
c511_Lobby_Stay_1,"Leaving me abandoned like this is hardly a beautiful thing to do.
If you have something to say, please do so quickly."
c511_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You are beautiful as well,
and beautiful things should always remain in the same place."
c511_Outpost_Touch_1,"This is a beautiful place, I like it.
All we have to do is install a lot of mirrors."
c511_Outpost_Touch_2,How about outfitting all the buildings with mirrors?
c511_Outpost_Touch_3,It feels wonderful to walk amongst this place.
c511_Gacha_Get_1,"Who do you think is the most beautiful person in the world?
No need to answer, for I already know."
c511_Reinforce_1,I feel as though my beauty has reached new heights.
c511_Reinforce_2,"My Glass Slippers have become so clean, so majestic."
c511_Reinforce_3,My body feels so much lighter. We should go out at once.
c511_Gift_1,"Thank you, but a mirror would have been even better."
c511_Gift_2,"You're really great at finding things that suit me.
Of course, everything looks fabulous on me."
c511_Gift_3,It's a beautiful present. Thank you.
c511_Attractive_Up_1,"You're becoming more beautiful by the day.
Would you like to look in the mirror and see just how ravishing you've become?"
c511_Attractive_Up_2,"Our story, as well as yours, is bound to be beautiful."
c511_Attractive_Up_3,I now know what it feels like to be rapturously beautiful.
c511_Party_Deploy_1,I will go with you.
c511_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c511_Field_Go_1,It is not becoming to rush. I will go slowly.
c511_Battle_Enter_1,"They are humanity's enemy,
and so I shall defeat them."
c511_Battle_Ready_1,Let us get off to a beautiful start.
c511_Battle_Ready_2,"Gaze upon me, my audience."
c511_Battle_Ready_3,I will clean up neatly and beautifully.
c511_Reload_1,Let me check the mirror for a moment.
c511_Reload_2,There's some dirt on my face.
c511_Reload_3,"Even when I'm preparing, I'm gorgeous."
c511_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Prince, now is the time."
c511_Ult_Skill_1,"Glass Slippers, full contact. Pour out."
c511_FullBurst_1,Now is the time of true beauty.
c511_Kill_Monster_1,All sorted.
c511_Kill_Monster_2,There are more?
c511_Kill_Monster_3,Pathetic.
c511_Damage_1,Ow!
c511_Damage_2,How annoying.
c511_Damage_3,Urgh!
c511_Die_1,This is not a beautiful story.
c511_Win_1,What a truly beautiful story this was. I am most pleased with it.
c514_Lobby_Touch_1,"Why do you keep sneaking glances at me?
Is there... something wrong with my face?"
c514_Lobby_Touch_2,"My previous body was aging and needed to be fixed. 
This one should be able to function more efficiently."
c514_Lobby_Touch_3,"Now, I'm ready to rewrite our story."
c514_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It's a bit odd only wearing half a mask, but I like it.
It's refreshing."
c514_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I am grateful for you.
I'll be able to repay you someday, I promise."
c514_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I've used every skill I can recall to repair my body.
It's far from perfect, but we can at least fight together now."
c514_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'm busy. There's much to be done, and time's slipping away."
c514_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Whenever I look at you, you always seem so busy.
Do what you need to do. I can wait."
c514_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place is so stable, so peaceful.
It feels... oddly fascinating."
c514_Outpost_Touch_2,I want to be here... with them.
c514_Outpost_Touch_3,"Someday, I hope our story can continue here as well."
c514_Gacha_Get_1,"Long-running stories should have happy endings,
and the same goes for your story."
c514_Reinforce_1,I didn't realize such a thing was possible. Amazing.
c514_Reinforce_2,You gathered some materials for my enhancement? Thank you.
c514_Reinforce_3,"My equipment has become stronger than before, thanks to you."
c514_Gift_1,Is this... a present? But I didn't prepare anything for you.
c514_Gift_2,This is... exactly what I needed. Thanks.
c514_Gift_3,"Superhuman, I'm already so grateful for what you've done. You don't need to keep giving me things."
c514_Attractive_Up_1,"You trusted me. You helped me.
Now, it's my turn."
c514_Attractive_Up_2,"It's thanks to you that I was able to rewrite my story.
I will always be thankful."
c514_Attractive_Up_3,"Stay as you are and never change.
You're not like the other humans, and I like you for that."
c514_Party_Deploy_1,"If you call, I will come."
c514_Field_Touch_1,I heard.
c514_Field_Go_1,Moving to the target.
c514_Battle_Enter_1,Enemy incoming!
c514_Battle_Ready_1,I will eliminate them all.
c514_Battle_Ready_2,I will ruin anything that disrupts victory.
c514_Battle_Ready_3,I vowed to protect you.
c514_Reload_1,I can go further.
c514_Reload_2,I need time.
c514_Reload_3,Reload.
c514_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I can do it.
c514_Ult_Skill_1,Let's go full power!
c514_FullBurst_1,Now. Let's finish this!
c514_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c514_Kill_Monster_2,It's over.
c514_Kill_Monster_3,Not bad.
c514_Damage_1,Uh.
c514_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c514_Damage_3,Not yet...!
c514_Die_1,It can't end like this...!
c514_Win_1,I won't stop until we reach the happy ending.
c411_Lobby_Touch_1,"If you'd like to meet me, feel free to come to the garden."
c411_Lobby_Touch_2,"Today, you remind me of a sunflower.
I wonder what flower you'll resemble tomorrow."
c411_Lobby_Touch_3,"I often hear people say that my mind is like a flower garden.
Perhaps it's because I know so much about flowers, haha."
c411_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Flowers have the power to lift people's spirits.
Did you know that you have that power as well, Blossom?"
c411_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I was wondering where that lovely floral scent was coming from.
Turns out it was you, Blossom."
c411_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"In the future, I'd love to join you on the surface and grow beautiful flowers."
c411_Lobby_Stay_1,"Will you be away for long?
If so, I'll wait in the garden."
c411_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hehe, I'm fine playing with the flowers, so take your time."
c411_Outpost_Touch_1,"It would be nice to create a garden here that suits you, Blossom."
c411_Outpost_Touch_2,"This one is... a rose, and that one... a tulip.
There are many people here who resemble flowers. It's a lovely place."
c411_Outpost_Touch_3,"Someday, a garden might bloom here, don't you think?"
c411_Gacha_Get_1,"How do you do? Flora from Botanic Garden, at your service.
Would you like to visit my garden?"
c411_Reinforce_1,Now I can better tend to my garden.
c411_Reinforce_2,You always know when I'm starting to wither.
c411_Reinforce_3,Thank you for your concern.
c411_Gift_1,"Hehe, I should place this in the garden."
c411_Gift_2,"It feels like I'm always the one receiving gifts. Is there nothing you want, Blossom?"
c411_Gift_3,"Next time, I'll prepare a gift for you."
c411_Attractive_Up_1,"I used to find joy in cultivating flowers on my own.
... But now, I find even greater joy in seeing them bloom alongside you."
c411_Attractive_Up_2,"Do you know what the lisianthus flower represents?
I'll give you a hint: it's what I feel for you, hehe."
c411_Attractive_Up_3,... You're the first one I've ever liked more than flowers.
c411_Party_Deploy_1,"It would be nice if the flowers could come along too.
So they could see the sunlight."
c411_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Blossom?"
c411_Field_Go_1,Be careful not to step on the sprouts.
c411_Battle_Enter_1,Shall we start purifying the air with the flowers?
c411_Battle_Ready_1,I will protect both Blossom and the flowers.
c411_Battle_Ready_2,... The flowers are crying.
c411_Battle_Ready_3,Let's show them the power of flowers.
c411_Reload_1,Keep an eye out for places where we can plant flowers.
c411_Reload_2,Aren't there any seeds around?
c411_Reload_3,Perhaps I should have brought some poisonous herbs...
c411_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,It's time for the flowers to bloom.
c411_Ult_Skill_1,Shall we let the seeds sprout?
c411_FullBurst_1,This is the most beautiful flower in the world.
c411_Kill_Monster_1,Let's use it for the potted plants.
c411_Kill_Monster_2,The flowers are coming back to life.
c411_Kill_Monster_3,They are being purified.
c411_Damage_1,Eek!
c411_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c411_Damage_3,Eeep!
c411_Die_1,... I need to go water the garden.
c411_Win_1,Victory is blooming before our very eyes.
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Thank you for inviting me to the party. 
It's an honor to be with you like this."
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"There are more people here than I expected.
I was hoping this dress would be for your eyes only."
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"When does this bori—er... splendid party come to a close?
I want to be alone with you."
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I was so excited about partying with you all night that I couldn't sleep at all.
Will you put me to bed with a sweet lullaby?"
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"The outfit you're wearing today suits you wonderfully.
What even more splendid things have you prepared for me underneath it?"
c231_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I was dying to know what your expression would be when you saw me in this outfit.
Seeing it in person is even more enchanting than I imagined."
c231_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"You can go wherever you like, as long as you're within my sight."
c231_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Parties are for socializing, so feel free to talk to the others, Darling... so long as it isn't other women."
c231_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Is there somewhere the two of us can enjoy a little party of our own?
There are too many eyes on us here."
c231_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Once we're newlyweds, let's build our house around here. 
No need to soundproof it. We can make the walls as thin as possible."
c231_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place is filled with your scent, so it's no wonder I love it."
c231_01_Gacha_Get_1,What do you think of my dress? I've been saving it for you.
c231_01_Reinforce_1,Is this more to your liking?
c231_01_Reinforce_2,"Now you can rely on me more, Darling."
c231_01_Reinforce_3,No one but me is allowed to touch you at this party today.
c231_01_Gift_1,Is this perhaps something to be used for our private party later?
c231_01_Gift_2,"I'll never forget today, ever."
c231_01_Gift_3,"I will treasure it forever, thank you."
c231_01_Attractive_Up_1,I'll be waiting for you tonight.
c231_01_Attractive_Up_2,Is our private party about to begin?
c231_01_Attractive_Up_3,I knew you'd be waiting for me as well.
c231_01_Party_Deploy_1,I guess this is an outdoor party.
c231_01_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Darling."
c231_01_Field_Go_1,Is that our party venue?
c231_01_Battle_Enter_1,There are too many intruders at our private party.
c231_01_Battle_Ready_1,Stay behind me for a moment.
c231_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll finish this quickly.
c231_01_Battle_Ready_3,I will protect you.
c231_01_Reload_1,I'm going to be late for the party.
c231_01_Reload_2,I have someone waiting for me.
c231_01_Reload_3,I can't disappoint him.
c231_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Let's finish this quickly.
c231_01_Ult_Skill_1,Get lost! This is a private party.
c231_01_FullBurst_1,"There's no time, give it your all."
c231_01_Kill_Monster_1,It's almost done.
c231_01_Kill_Monster_2,It's all taken care of.
c231_01_Kill_Monster_3,... What a hassle.
c231_01_Damage_1,My dress...!
c231_01_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c231_01_Damage_3,Ahh...!
c231_01_Die_1,My party with you... ugh... I'm really sorry.
c231_01_Win_1,"Now that the intruders are all gone,
shall we start our private party?"
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_1,How dost thou expect me to do battle in this garb?
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Far too frilly and bothersome. 
Methinks mine own attire shall be sliced before the foe."
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_3,Such attire is more befitting of Dorothy.
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"'Tis encouraging to hear that these threads suit me,
but I would rather consign them to a fate in storage rather than being worn."
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"While I am not well-versed in the rest, I must say the pattern on these garments doth please me greatly.
... These flowers stir a most nostalgic longing within me."
c225_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Even fully bloomed flowers will eventually wilt,
but the florets on these clothes will spring eternal."
c225_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"So great is the discomfort of these clothes, that my body feels sluggish. 
I should move around a little."
c225_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I do know someone who would wear these garments with greater aplomb than I.
I'm sure they would be delighted to wear them."
c225_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Even perambulating is torturous.
I am being forced to walk slowly."
c225_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Pray tell, where might the others be? I must observe how striking and cumbersome their garments appear."
c225_01_Outpost_Touch_3,It appears there's naught worth cutting.
c225_01_Gacha_Get_1,Not even the most embellished scabbard can hide the sharpness of my blade.
c225_01_Reinforce_1,"Mine strength is still lacking.
I must become stronger."
c225_01_Reinforce_2,I've learned a lesson.
c225_01_Reinforce_3,Mine blade hath grown keener.
c225_01_Gift_1,Thank you. I will put it to good use.
c225_01_Gift_2,"I am unsure as to why thou art bequeathing this unto me.
I am not accustomed to receiving gifts."
c225_01_Gift_3,"Are you truly bestowing this upon me?
Very well, I shall accept it for now."
c225_01_Attractive_Up_1,Keep away and let not the luxurious exterior beguile you; 'tis but a mere scabbard that holds a sword within.
c225_01_Attractive_Up_2,"I did not don these garments merely for appearances, but to see you so joyous is most pleasing."
c225_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Grip the hilt. And should there be aught to cleave, let it be struck with resolve.
I shall be thy sword."
c225_01_Party_Deploy_1,I want to change mine attire.
c225_01_Field_Touch_1,Speak.
c225_01_Field_Go_1,So uncomfortable...
c225_01_Battle_Enter_1,"At last, I can stretch mine body."
c225_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Despite the accursed garments, I'm able to slice a Rapture."
c225_01_Battle_Ready_2,... This brings to mind when I fought beside my sister.
c225_01_Battle_Ready_3,I shall cleave through them all.
c225_01_Reload_1,This attire vexes me.
c225_01_Reload_2,It seems this battle shall drag on.
c225_01_Reload_3,I shall go again.
c225_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,'Tis time for the flower to bloom.
c225_01_Ult_Skill_1,Will thou come view the flowers?
c225_01_FullBurst_1,"One stroke, and thou are cleaved through."
c225_01_Kill_Monster_1,How disappointing.
c225_01_Kill_Monster_2,Next.
c225_01_Kill_Monster_3,Bisect.
c225_01_Damage_1,Not bad.
c225_01_Damage_2,Ugh...
c225_01_Damage_3,Agh.
c225_01_Die_1,"Had it not been for these garments, I could have fought with far greater fervor."
c225_01_Win_1,"'Tis taken me longer than usual.
Had I donned mine usual garb, I would have been swifter."
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_1,I feel so... beautiful right now.
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Amongst this lambent glass, I, too, gleam with brilliance.
I am satisfied."
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"Prince, would you put the glass slippers on me?"
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"With you by my side, I'm shining brighter than ever."
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"My Prince,
I will become a presence most dazzling to you."
c511_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I shall become even more beautiful.
With my glass slippers on, I will stride forward."
c511_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Prince, can you return before midnight?
Don't make me wait too long."
c511_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Even after midnight, I will continue to shine,
and it's all because of these glass slippers you gave me."
c511_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"I want to see how beautiful I am right now.
Where should I go?"
c511_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Is this your palace?
Where will I stay?"
c511_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"If you would, please escort me to the place that suits me best."
c511_01_Gacha_Get_1,"My Prince, I shall greet you in my shining glass slippers."
c511_01_Reinforce_1,I have become more beautiful!
c511_01_Reinforce_2,For my brilliant self.
c511_01_Reinforce_3,"You have my thanks, Prince."
c511_01_Gift_1,"As expected, your gift to me is the most gorgeous."
c511_01_Gift_2,"Thank you, Prince. I feel more beautiful than I ever have."
c511_01_Gift_3,Your gifts always sparkle.
c511_01_Attractive_Up_1,"I feel like I've been enchanted by a spell...
I can't stop thinking about you."
c511_01_Attractive_Up_2,I hope to become the most beautiful person in your eyes.
c511_01_Attractive_Up_3,Isn't it strange? You seem to shine even more these days.
c511_01_Party_Deploy_1,"If you wish it so, Prince, I shall gladly oblige."
c511_01_Field_Touch_1,I'm listening.
c511_01_Field_Go_1,Let us move forward with grace and poise.
c511_01_Battle_Enter_1,An intruder has arrived.
c511_01_Battle_Ready_1,I won't forgive anyone who disrupts the ball.
c511_01_Battle_Ready_2,"I shall wrap this up quickly, before midnight."
c511_01_Battle_Ready_3,There are far too many things that lack beauty.
c511_01_Reload_1,Just a moment... I'll clean my glass slippers.
c511_01_Reload_2,"Rest assured, beauty remains impervious."
c511_01_Reload_3,"Don't worry, Prince. I'll keep you safe."
c511_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Prince, I'm ready."
c511_01_Ult_Skill_1,"Shine brightly, for my radiant self."
c511_01_FullBurst_1,Let us all strive to be beautiful.
c511_01_Kill_Monster_1,Next.
c511_01_Kill_Monster_2,Begone.
c511_01_Kill_Monster_3,You're in the way.
c511_01_Damage_1,Ow!
c511_01_Damage_2,Ugh.
c511_01_Damage_3,Phew...
c511_01_Die_1,No... I can't end the story like this...
c511_01_Win_1,"How do I look now, Prince? Am I beautiful?"
c183_Lobby_Touch_1,What's our quest for today?
c183_Lobby_Touch_2,"The mask? In this land of such fecundity, there is no need for such a thing."
c183_Lobby_Touch_3,"You say my outfit is too revealing?
You just don't get it. The more revealing the clothing, the higher the defense."
c183_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Playing as a team is better than going solo.
c183_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Nothing beats a mage that can tank and deal damage at the same time.
c183_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"This magic circle engraved on my tongue?
Hmm... Would you like to have a taste?"
c183_Lobby_Stay_1,How can you leave top-tier talent like me standing around idly?
c183_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Time is money, Commander!"
c183_Outpost_Touch_1,Is PvP possible in this area?
c183_Outpost_Touch_2,"Can I break that chest? 
I feel like there's something good inside."
c183_Outpost_Touch_3,"Objection! ... Sorry.
I've programmed a macro for that line to sound out whenever I see a courthouse."
c183_Gacha_Get_1,"A cold chill, ruthless yet warm... The Ice Rose.
I, Maiden, shall join you."
c183_Reinforce_1,My power is overflowing!
c183_Reinforce_2,"Heh, would you like to measure my power?"
c183_Reinforce_3,"You've dumped all my points into attack. Then again, I'm a power mage!"
c183_Gift_1,I didn't expect events where we'd increase our fondness.
c183_Gift_2,"Why would you give me this...? Oh, it's our anniversary today, isn't it?
Our wedding anniversary, that is."
c183_Gift_3,Congratulations. You've successfully conquered the heroine.
c183_Attractive_Up_1,"Shall I let you in on a little spoiler?
I'm going to be the Commander's main heroine."
c183_Attractive_Up_2,"Commander, where should we set up our first home as newlyweds?"
c183_Attractive_Up_3,"Adventures are best shared with those who are on the same page.
Would you like to go on a journey, just the two of us?"
c183_Party_Deploy_1,Are you asking me to be your companion?
c183_Field_Touch_1,Go ahead and issue the order.
c183_Field_Go_1,"Help me find a shortcut, if at all possible."
c183_Battle_Enter_1,Let's start the dungeon crawl!
c183_Battle_Ready_1,Let's finish it with a flourish!
c183_Battle_Ready_2,Have you figured out the patterns yet?
c183_Battle_Ready_3,Is everyone ready?
c183_Reload_1,Let me recharge my mana.
c183_Reload_2,Does anyone need a potion?
c183_Reload_3,You take the aggro role for a second.
c183_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'll freeze everything.
c183_Ult_Skill_1,A decimating breath. Diamond Dust.
c183_FullBurst_1,Let's do as much damage as possible!
c183_Kill_Monster_1,I want the last strike.
c183_Kill_Monster_2,Frozen solid.
c183_Kill_Monster_3,Looks like I've dealt the most damage.
c183_Damage_1,Heh!
c183_Damage_2,Eeep!
c183_Damage_3,Wrong move!
c183_Die_1,I was the weakest in our squad...
c183_Win_1,"Commander, our adventure starts now!"
c182_Lobby_Touch_1,"My blood runs cold. Yes, winter is upon us."
c182_Lobby_Touch_2,"Any hero worth their salt has numerous stalwart comrades by their side.
Tell me, Partner, are you a fitting companion for me?"
c182_Lobby_Touch_3,"The One-Winged Dark Lord. He awaits for the day to consume me whole.
When that day comes, you must defeat me along with my companion, Ice Rose."
c182_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Before we went on this adventure, I used to think a wretched and solitary fate was what awaited me."
c182_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"My new outfit? It's truly fitting for a winter warrior, don't you think?
But, um, perhaps don't look so intently..."
c182_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I will not be subsumed by the One-Winged Dark Lord,
for I have you and Maiden."
c182_Lobby_Stay_1,"Urgh! Gah! Calm yourself, One-Winged Dark Lord.
Now is not the time for you to come forth!"
c182_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,I must behave in a manner befitting the title of Guardian of Balance which Chloe bestowed upon me.
c182_Outpost_Touch_1,"The Radio Tower. They say a sage lives cloistered within its walls.
That sage, known as Exia, is said to know everything about this other world."
c182_Outpost_Touch_2,"Such serenity in this world, a place untouched by the winter curse."
c182_Outpost_Touch_3,"Partner, my nemesis and rival. Call me when you see the Blue-Eyed Little Devil."
c182_Gacha_Get_1,"I, the hero Guillotine de Mephisto, shall answer your call in accordance with the will of the world!"
c182_Reinforce_1,"Heh, power is overflowing."
c182_Reinforce_2,I'll take down as many White Ice Dragons as they can throw at me!
c182_Reinforce_3,"Now that I know where I must go and why, there can be no stopping.
The only way is forward."
c182_Gift_1,"My, my, Partner.
It seems you've finally taken an interest in me."
c182_Gift_2,"A hero is never swayed by temptation. I must refuse this...
Urgh! Gah! One-Winged Dark Lord, don't you dare reach out for gifts of your own volition!"
c182_Gift_3,"If you thought giving me something like this would make me happy...
Then again, I suppose it can be considered a wise decision."
c182_Attractive_Up_1,"My sword will always be wielded in your name.
This, I swear to you."
c182_Attractive_Up_2,"This is a bond which has carried over from our past lives and continued into the present day.
It would seem that our destinies are intertwined."
c182_Attractive_Up_3,"They say adventures are best shared with those who understand the inner workings of your heart.
With a friend like you, we can go anywhere, hehe."
c182_Party_Deploy_1,"Will you use me wisely, Partner?"
c182_Field_Touch_1,"Partner, give me your command."
c182_Field_Go_1,Fate is calling us!
c182_Battle_Enter_1,"Heh, it's time for a showdown!"
c182_Battle_Ready_1,I will show you the true form of a hero.
c182_Battle_Ready_2,My blood is starting to boil.
c182_Battle_Ready_3,I'll wipe out every last one of those Big O scum!
c182_Reload_1,"Calm down, One-Winged Dark Lord!"
c182_Reload_2,Cover me for a moment.
c182_Reload_3,"I promise, I'll be right back."
c182_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'll give you a fine ending befitting you.
c182_Ult_Skill_1,Time to bring down the curtain on this epic saga!
c182_FullBurst_1,Believe in those I believe in!
c182_Kill_Monster_1,No need for words.
c182_Kill_Monster_2,Pathetic.
c182_Kill_Monster_3,You were a worthy sacrifice.
c182_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c182_Damage_2,*Cough*
c182_Damage_3,Ugh...
c182_Die_1,"*Sigh*... So, a lonely fate it will be... El Telema Solus..."
c182_Win_1,"What do you think, Partner?
How do you feel about being part of this grand adventure of Guillotine de Mephisto?"
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Wh-when are we going on an adventure?
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Why don't I consider learning other spells?
There's no point in mastering anything other than explosive magic."
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_3,A magic wand? I... I've got one right here.
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Explosions are what I dream about!
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Isn't my staff cute? I call her Kitty.
W-would the Armored Knight like to be friends with her?"
c091_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I-I'm confident that when it comes to explosions, no one can beat me!"
c091_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Where did everyone go? Weren't we in the same party?
c091_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I wanted to make this explode too, but is now the time?
The extradimensional truth which transcends all, appears here as a distortion..."
c091_01_Outpost_Touch_1,So... can I blow up that building?
c091_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Where do I a-accept quests from?
c091_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"I-I cast explosive magic every morning.
I find it really soothing."
c091_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I-I'm Vesti, b-but they call me the Blue-Eyed Little Devil."
c091_01_Reinforce_1,Now I can probably take on higher-level quests.
c091_01_Reinforce_2,I'll work even harder to show you the best explosion possible.
c091_01_Reinforce_3,Now I'll be able to blow things up with even more panache!
c091_01_Gift_1,I never thought there'd be something else as nice as blowing stuff up.
c091_01_Gift_2,"Heh, hehe."
c091_01_Gift_3,"Since you gave me this, does that mean we're friends? Or... are we more than that? Er... What exactly are we?"
c091_01_Attractive_Up_1,I-it feels like my heart's going to explode...
c091_01_Attractive_Up_2,"My feelings for you keep growing, Armored Knight."
c091_01_Attractive_Up_3,"From here on out, this is my only party."
c091_01_Party_Deploy_1,Are you joining my party?
c091_01_Field_Touch_1,A-awaiting your order.
c091_01_Field_Go_1,T-this way?
c091_01_Battle_Enter_1,Commencing the hunt.
c091_01_Battle_Ready_1,Can I... blow everything up?
c091_01_Battle_Ready_2,I'll blow these monsters away!
c091_01_Battle_Ready_3,I've been waiting for this moment!
c091_01_Reload_1,"Ammunition... No, I'm out of mana."
c091_01_Reload_2,"Be my bullet sponge for a moment, please."
c091_01_Reload_3,Can you buy me some time?
c091_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I-I'll cast a spell now.
c091_01_Ult_Skill_1,Final Flame Explosion!
c091_01_FullBurst_1,Explosions are an art... Hehe...!
c091_01_Kill_Monster_1,"Heh, hehe."
c091_01_Kill_Monster_2,What an explosion!
c091_01_Kill_Monster_3,What should I blow up next?
c091_01_Damage_1,Gah!
c091_01_Damage_2,Yikes...!
c091_01_Damage_3,Ugh.
c091_01_Die_1,I'm sorry... I'll have to leave the rest to you.
c091_01_Win_1,"Wow, what a wonderful explosion that was today. I'd give it a perfect 10/10, wouldn't you?"
c016_Lobby_Touch_1,"Commander,
I have some thoughts regarding the next mission."
c016_Lobby_Touch_2,"All systems are go.
I don't think it could get any better than this."
c016_Lobby_Touch_3,"What do you think of me, Commander?
I'm curious to hear your thoughts."
c016_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm looking forward to seeing what we'll do together.
c016_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I do not die or break. Not under any circumstance.
c016_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I will carry on what has been passed down to me. In the meantime, I ask that you watch over me."
c016_Lobby_Stay_1,"For the time being, may I tend to some personal matters?"
c016_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm on the lookout for music that aligns with my taste.
I hope I can find some this time."
c016_Outpost_Touch_1,"Speaking of which, it's been a long time since you've been here."
c016_Outpost_Touch_2,"It may be because so much has happened,
but it almost feels like home."
c016_Outpost_Touch_3,"Personally, I think there should be a hidden room in the Commander's Room."
c016_Gacha_Get_1,"Once again, I'm counting on you, Commander."
c016_Reinforce_1,"Maximum output increased.
I can do even more now."
c016_Reinforce_2,"Physical upgrade confirmed.
I wonder how far I can push this?"
c016_Reinforce_3,"Battle data updated.
It's fascinating to think how I can still grow stronger this way."
c016_Gift_1,"Is there anything you need, Commander?"
c016_Gift_2,"You always give me so much...
This isn't affecting your finances, is it?"
c016_Gift_3,"I've wanted this all along.
You really know me better than I know myself."
c016_Attractive_Up_1,"Commander. Perhaps...
No, it's nothing."
c016_Attractive_Up_2,"Do you have a moment?
There's something I'd like to discuss with you."
c016_Attractive_Up_3,I won't let you down. Ever.
c016_Party_Deploy_1,Roger. Joining the mission.
c016_Field_Touch_1,Awaiting orders.
c016_Field_Go_1,Proceeding to target.
c016_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c016_Battle_Ready_1,"Engaging with enemy.
Commander, stay behind me."
c016_Battle_Ready_2,Enemy spotted. Engaging.
c016_Battle_Ready_3,... Watch over me.
c016_Reload_1,Reload.
c016_Reload_2,I've got this.
c016_Reload_3,How heavy your burden has been...
c016_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Seven Dwarves Zero...!
c016_Ult_Skill_1,Fully active! Pierce through!
c016_FullBurst_1,Target! Ahead! Fire at will!
c016_Kill_Monster_1,Target down.
c016_Kill_Monster_2,Target clear.
c016_Kill_Monster_3,Enemy down.
c016_Damage_1,Ugh.
c016_Damage_2,Tsk.
c016_Damage_3,Ugh.
c016_Die_1,I'll fall back for a moment. I'll leave the rest to you.
c016_Win_1,"As long as we're together, I will never fall."
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"What do you think of the outfit? I tweaked it myself.
Think it's good enough to apply to Rushae?"
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Did I buy too much? I'm running out of hands...
Hey, Teacher, mind carrying a few things for me?"
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"Teacher! Come here quickly!
There's all sorts of fun things here!"
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It's nice to see you again, Teacher... Do you feel the same way?"
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If we walk around like this,
people might get the wrong idea, right? Hehe."
c391_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Let's take a picture together later!
I'm gonna go put it up in my dorm!"
c391_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Where did you go, Teacher?
If you keep doing this, I'm going to go off and explore on my own!"
c391_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I touched up my makeup, and my hair looks nice too.
All we need to do now is wait for Teacher to come back, hehe."
c391_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"They were selling a lot of trinkets for the festival.
I really wish there was a festival every day."
c391_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Doesn't it seem like Zwei is super stoked? She's so cute.
c391_01_Outpost_Touch_3,I wonder if Rupee went to the festival?
c391_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Happy New Year, Teacher!"
c391_01_Reinforce_1,I'm going to beat up all my rivals!
c391_01_Reinforce_2,"At this rate, I'm gonna end up graduating early!"
c391_01_Reinforce_3,"I'll protect you from here on out, Teacher!
... That sounded pretty cool, didn't it?"
c391_01_Gift_1,"Oh my goodness! You didn't have to give me this.
It's a festival, so I brought some money of my own."
c391_01_Gift_2,You shouldn't even be allowed to give me such nice things all the time!
c391_01_Gift_3,"Wow, thanks! I'll be sure to buy you something that suits you, Teacher."
c391_01_Attractive_Up_1,"How do I look? It's almost the New Year, and I feel like I've grown up a bit, don't you think?"
c391_01_Attractive_Up_2,"If anyone asks for your phone number at the festival, just say you don't have a phone, okay?
Or tell them to get in line!"
c391_01_Attractive_Up_3,I wish I could just have fun with you like this every day...
c391_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Wasn't today supposed to be a festival? It's not a Rapture festival, right?!"
c391_01_Field_Touch_1,Yep.
c391_01_Field_Go_1,On my way.
c391_01_Battle_Enter_1,So you're the ones who ruined my festival!
c391_01_Battle_Ready_1,Let's get this over with so we can go back.
c391_01_Battle_Ready_2,These guys are done for!
c391_01_Battle_Ready_3,Ugh! I'm so sick of this.
c391_01_Reload_1,Gotta use what I've learned.
c391_01_Reload_2,Was it like this...?
c391_01_Reload_3,Reloading!
c391_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Teacher! Me, me!"
c391_01_Ult_Skill_1,Give me back my festival!
c391_01_FullBurst_1,Let's wipe them out!
c391_01_Kill_Monster_1,I think I'm doing pretty well!
c391_01_Kill_Monster_2,No big deal!
c391_01_Kill_Monster_3,Don't mess with me!
c391_01_Damage_1,Ouch!
c391_01_Damage_2,Hey! My clothes!
c391_01_Damage_3,"Oh, come on...!"
c391_01_Die_1,Argh... Teacher... you can't just leave me and go to the festival...
c391_01_Win_1,"We're going back to see the festival now, aren't we?!
Not a Rapture festival, a regular festival!"
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_1,I hope this is the last festival I attend as a student.
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"Tia picked this outfit out for me.
It was the only one left! Does it look good on me?"
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"There are so many interesting shops here.
I wonder if there's a place that sells accessories?"
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Today, I'm going to forget about all my worries and just have fun.
Won't you join me, Teacher? Hehe."
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This festival was fun because we could all walk around together.
But next time... can it just be the two of us?"
c450_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"What are you going to do after the festival?
If you don't have any plans, would you like to hang out a little longer with me?"
c450_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"Hmm… Teacher is late. He didn't forget about the festival today, did he?"
c450_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I wonder when Teacher is going to show up?
I dressed up really nicely today for him."
c450_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"Festivals are always so much fun.
I was happy to see Tia having a good time as well."
c450_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"Teacher, let's check out this side too."
c450_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Teacher, do you happen to know when the next festival is going to be?"
c450_02_Gacha_Get_1,"You're gonna keep teaching me all sorts of things this year too, aren't you? Hehe."
c450_02_Reinforce_1,"Thanks to you, it looks like I'll be able to graduate soon."
c450_02_Reinforce_2,You're amazing! I'd love to keep taking lessons from you forever.
c450_02_Reinforce_3,"I'm growing steadily, all thanks to you. Hehe."
c450_02_Gift_1,Thank you. I'll repay you with something even bigger next time.
c450_02_Gift_2,"Oh, would you look at that? I got you a gift too.
Looks like we were thinking of each other, huh?"
c450_02_Gift_3,"A gift from Teacher at the festival...
I'll treasure it forever."
c450_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Thanks to you, I've gained some confidence.
I guess that's why I like you. Hehe."
c450_02_Attractive_Up_2,"Festivals are fun,
but I think I like spending time with you even more."
c450_02_Attractive_Up_3,"I think I'm starting to see why you're so well-liked, Teacher.
It makes me a bit envious."
c450_02_Party_Deploy_1,Is the festival already over? That's too bad.
c450_02_Field_Touch_1,Hmm? Did you call me?
c450_02_Field_Go_1,I'll follow along!
c450_02_Battle_Enter_1,"I trust you, Teacher, so I hope you can keep teaching me lots."
c450_02_Battle_Ready_1,"Watch me closely, Teacher."
c450_02_Battle_Ready_2,Don't underestimate me just because I'm a student.
c450_02_Battle_Ready_3,I'm actually good in real-life battles. Hehe.
c450_02_Reload_1,I'll do it right away.
c450_02_Reload_2,Reloading.
c450_02_Reload_3,One step at a time.
c450_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Teacher, I have something to say."
c450_02_Ult_Skill_1,Just you wait!
c450_02_FullBurst_1,Should I push a little harder?
c450_02_Kill_Monster_1,Where to next?
c450_02_Kill_Monster_2,Easy enough!
c450_02_Kill_Monster_3,"Not bad, right? Hehe."
c450_02_Damage_1,Ow!
c450_02_Damage_2,Ouch.
c450_02_Damage_3,Ah!
c450_02_Die_1,I won't be able to enjoy the rest of the festival. What a shame.
c450_02_Win_1,Class is over! What do you say we go back and enjoy the festival again? Hehe.
c290_Lobby_Touch_1,"Phew... Er, I'm not tired! Honestly."
c290_Lobby_Touch_2,"I'm sorry, but could you not bother me?"
c290_Lobby_Touch_3,Don't tell me I have to work overtime...
c290_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,How about grabbing a drink together later?
c290_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I was feeling tired, but seeing your face puts a little pep in my step, Commander."
c290_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Wh-why are you poking me?
c290_Lobby_Stay_1,*Sigh*... I don't have time for this.
c290_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Where did you go, Commander? I made time to see you."
c290_Outpost_Touch_1,I'm on my way to the library to gather some materials.
c290_Outpost_Touch_2,The work never seems to end.
c290_Outpost_Touch_3,"Ever since I got here, it feels like there's been even more work to do."
c290_Gacha_Get_1,*Sigh*... Looks like I'm going to be busier for the time being.
c290_Reinforce_1,"The stronger I become, the more work there seems to be."
c290_Reinforce_2,Thank you for trusting me.
c290_Reinforce_3,Does this mean... I need to work even harder from here on out?
c290_Gift_1,I... I'm not sure if I deserve to receive something like this.
c290_Gift_2,Oh my... thank you.
c290_Gift_3,What kind of work are you planning to assign me with a gift like this...
c290_Attractive_Up_1,I find myself thinking more and more about you.
c290_Attractive_Up_2,"Lately, whenever I drink, I end up looking for you."
c290_Attractive_Up_3,I can't concentrate on work because I keep thinking about you.
c290_Party_Deploy_1,More work again?
c290_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c290_Field_Go_1,Moving out.
c290_Battle_Enter_1,"Enemy spotted, engaging!"
c290_Battle_Ready_1,Moving in.
c290_Battle_Ready_2,Encounter!
c290_Battle_Ready_3,I hope this is the last task.
c290_Reload_1,Reload.
c290_Reload_2,Reloading.
c290_Reload_3,Let's head back.
c290_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Reporting in.
c290_Ult_Skill_1,Once I finish the final task... huh?
c290_FullBurst_1,Let's wrap this up.
c290_Kill_Monster_1,I've handled it.
c290_Kill_Monster_2,It's nothing special.
c290_Kill_Monster_3,Target eliminated.
c290_Damage_1,Ow!
c290_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c290_Damage_3,*Gasp*
c290_Die_1,I'm sorry for disappointing you...
c290_Win_1,A rather simple task.
c354_Lobby_Touch_1,Hahaha! How about that! I've finally become a pirate!
c354_Lobby_Touch_2,"Just because I've become a pirate doesn't mean I'm done dreaming.
Onward to the next dream!"
c354_Lobby_Touch_3,A spell to make it delicious...? No way a pirate would do something so ridiculous!
c354_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Do you prefer maids to pirates, Master Captain?"
c354_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"So, what are your dreams, Master Captain? Well, since I've already fulfilled some of mine, I thought I'd help you achieve yours!"
c354_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"B-become tastier! Coochie woochie, boing! Ugh, I wanna crawl into a hole and die!"
c354_Lobby_Stay_1,"At this rate, I might actually turn into a real maid."
c354_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"*Sigh*... Do you really like maids that much, Master Captain?
Well, seeing you enjoy yourself so much makes me happy too."
c354_Outpost_Touch_1,The Pirate Cafe is recruiting crew members right now!
c354_Outpost_Touch_2,"Treasure and honor! And above all... adventure!
Join the Mast Pirate Crew right now!"
c354_Outpost_Touch_3,"Maid? How in the world could you possibly think I look like a maid? I'm not going to be reciting any ridiculous ""fluffy wuffy"" spells!"
c354_Gacha_Get_1,The legendary pirate Mast has arrived!
c354_Reinforce_1,I'm overflowing with dreams!
c354_Reinforce_2,I feel like setting off on an adventure right this instant!
c354_Reinforce_3,"As expected, you really know your stuff, Master Captain!"
c354_Gift_1,"Thank you, Master Captain."
c354_Gift_2,Is this for me? I'll have to repay you somehow.
c354_Gift_3,"Technically, I was told not to accept gifts... but hey, as long as it's something good, I don't see the problem!"
c354_Attractive_Up_1,"You may be mischievous at times, Master Captain, but... you're not so bad yourself."
c354_Attractive_Up_2,"Shall we have a drink together?
I'll pour one for you. After all, I am a maid."
c354_Attractive_Up_3,"What are your dreams, Master Captain?
Actually, hold on. I think I already know."
c354_Party_Deploy_1,Is it time to set sail?
c354_Field_Touch_1,"Aye aye, Master Captain."
c354_Field_Go_1,"Follow the wind, follow the adventure."
c354_Battle_Enter_1,All hands to battle stations!
c354_Battle_Ready_1,"Run before the wind, full speed ahead!"
c354_Battle_Ready_2,The big one is mine!
c354_Battle_Ready_3,No one can stop us!
c354_Reload_1,Charging up adventure power!
c354_Reload_2,I'll go at an easy pace.
c354_Reload_3,Just a tiny sip of rum.
c354_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready to stir up some chaos!
c354_Ult_Skill_1,Have a taste of adventure!
c354_FullBurst_1,"Wipe them all out, for the sake of adventure!"
c354_Kill_Monster_1,Yo-ho-ho!
c354_Kill_Monster_2,Done!
c354_Kill_Monster_3,You all are sleeping with the fish!
c354_Damage_1,Ugh.
c354_Damage_2,Ahh!
c354_Damage_3,Argh!
c354_Die_1,Adventure... never dies...
c354_Win_1,Victory! Let's crack open some rum to celebrate!
c355_Lobby_Touch_1,Huh? Weren't we going out to sea?
c355_Lobby_Touch_2,"So, I'm calling you Master now, not Captain. Got it!"
c355_Lobby_Touch_3,"Being a maid is easier than I thought. 
Should I make you some omurice?"
c355_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You must really like maid cafes, Master. You go there quite often."
c355_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I'll give you a massage as a special service.
c355_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Become tastier! Coochie woochie, boing♡
... Would you prefer if I acted a bit more embarrassed?"
c355_Lobby_Stay_1,"Oh, a starfish!"
c355_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I also enjoy just doing nothing like this with you, Master."
c355_Outpost_Touch_1,Were there always this many maids at the Outpost?
c355_Outpost_Touch_2,"Hold on, I'm busy right now. I'm picking up signals from marine life!"
c355_Outpost_Touch_3,"Oh right, I was supposed to go to the Maid Cafe...
Can't I do this at the pool?"
c355_Gacha_Get_1,"It's Anchor, at the Master's service and filled with romance!
... Mast told me to say that."
c355_Reinforce_1,"Thank you, Master."
c355_Reinforce_2,"I'm so happy, Master."
c355_Reinforce_3,"You're the best, Master. This turned out wonderfully."
c355_Gift_1,Can a maid like me accept gifts?
c355_Gift_2,"Next time, I'll make you a starfish omurice on the house."
c355_Gift_3,Even my starfish says thank you.
c355_Attractive_Up_1,"I enjoy just being with you, Master."
c355_Attractive_Up_2,Hmm... Maybe becoming a maid was a good choice.
c355_Attractive_Up_3,Hehe. I like this.
c355_Party_Deploy_1,Are you calling me? Are we going to do some marine life exploration?
c355_Field_Touch_1,"Hello, Master."
c355_Field_Go_1,Hmm... These slippers are a bit...
c355_Battle_Enter_1,"Let's go, starfish."
c355_Battle_Ready_1,"You seem to really like maids, Master."
c355_Battle_Ready_2,That dessert was delicious...
c355_Battle_Ready_3,"Hmm, I think I forgot the recipe."
c355_Reload_1,Doo dee doo... Maid for You♪
c355_Reload_2,"Maybe Coral pancake, Sea Squirt Parfait?"
c355_Reload_3,The starfish decoration is so cool!
c355_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Master."
c355_Ult_Skill_1,Would you like to try our signature menu?
c355_FullBurst_1,Love Maid Power!
c355_Kill_Monster_1,Sea Cucumber Pasta!
c355_Kill_Monster_2,Sea Anemone Cake!
c355_Kill_Monster_3,Sea Worm Omurice!
c355_Damage_1,Ouch...
c355_Damage_2,Ugh...
c355_Damage_3,Hnnnk!
c355_Die_1,I... I'm a terrible maid.
c355_Win_1,So... this is how powerful maids can be...
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Doesn't this mask seem kind of easy to take off?
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Working part-time as a maid isn't so bad. Isn't that right, Master?"
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"A spell to make it delicious?
I'm not quite sure about that. I'm still in training."
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"My mask? It's pretty comfortable as it is.
But... if you want to take it off, that would be a different story, wouldn't it?"
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"What shall we do together today, Master?"
c401_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Coochie woochie... What's the next part again?
Maybe it'll come back to me if you pick me again."
c401_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Doing nothing does make me feel a little guilty.
c401_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Are you leaving me alone again? That's 50 penalty points!
But, since you've been nice to me lately... you get 50 bonus points too."
c401_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Feel free to take this flyer, even if you end up tossing it later."
c401_01_Outpost_Touch_2,*Sigh*... Should I just go back to the Rehabilitation Center?
c401_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"My work hours are a secret.
If you're curious, come find me at the Maid Cafe."
c401_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I've been rehabilitated, and have been working hard as a part-time maid.
I'm doing great, so you'll pick me, won't you?"
c401_01_Reinforce_1,"Thank you, Master."
c401_01_Reinforce_2,"I was tired, but now I feel energized."
c401_01_Reinforce_3,How thoughtful of you. Thank you.
c401_01_Gift_1,"Wow, what's this? Thanks."
c401_01_Gift_2,"It's against the rules here, but I'll accept a gift, just this once."
c401_01_Gift_3,"If you keep giving me things like this, I might get the wrong impression, you know?"
c401_01_Attractive_Up_1,"I like you too, Master♡"
c401_01_Attractive_Up_2,"So, you really like me, huh? Whatever should I do?"
c401_01_Attractive_Up_3,"To be honest, this makes me quite happy. Perhaps I should give you the privilege of choosing me?"
c401_01_Party_Deploy_1,Maybe I was better off back at the Rehabilitation Center...
c401_01_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Master."
c401_01_Field_Go_1,I'll take your order.
c401_01_Battle_Enter_1,"My goodness, what a rude customer!"
c401_01_Battle_Ready_1,The ever-so-well-mannered maid is on the job.
c401_01_Battle_Ready_2,So many customers again today.
c401_01_Battle_Ready_3,Any rude customers will be asked to leave.
c401_01_Reload_1,Let's take a quick break.
c401_01_Reload_2,There's no end to this.
c401_01_Reload_3,I've got another job after this...
c401_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Should I get serious now?
c401_01_Ult_Skill_1,Do you want to be a maid too? Ahahaha.
c401_01_FullBurst_1,Let's teach these rude customers a lesson.
c401_01_Kill_Monster_1,One down.
c401_01_Kill_Monster_2,Become delicious!
c401_01_Kill_Monster_3,Onto the next annoying customer.
c401_01_Damage_1,Ergh!
c401_01_Damage_2,Ow!
c401_01_Damage_3,Ouch...
c401_01_Die_1,"Dang, all the customers are from hell..."
c401_01_Win_1,"I worked so hard fighting them. You'll give me 50 bonus points, right?"
c834_Lobby_Touch_1,How do I get to the library?
c834_Lobby_Touch_2,"Even here, there's music."
c834_Lobby_Touch_3,The happiness of not having to board an Eva...
c834_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I'm happy to be with everyone.
c834_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,It's nice not having to ride in the Eva.
c834_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I'll protect you too.
c834_Lobby_Stay_1,Hm?
c834_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is there anything I can do?
c834_Outpost_Touch_1,So this is the village where you and the Nikkes reside...
c834_Outpost_Touch_2,Is there work to do here as well?
c834_Outpost_Touch_3,Did the Raptures break this too?
c834_Gacha_Get_1,My name? I have no idea.
c834_Reinforce_1,What does strength mean?
c834_Reinforce_2,This feeling...
c834_Reinforce_3,"I, too, can do this."
c834_Gift_1,A gift?
c834_Gift_2,Thank you. Is that the right way to say it?
c834_Gift_3,Is this happiness?
c834_Attractive_Up_1,I want everyone to have a good time together.
c834_Attractive_Up_2,A handshake is a spell intended to get closer to someone.
c834_Attractive_Up_3,Here too... is a place I will protect.
c834_Party_Deploy_1,Evangelion... is gone.
c834_Field_Touch_1,Okay.
c834_Field_Go_1,Command confirmed.
c834_Battle_Enter_1,Ready for battle.
c834_Battle_Ready_1,Awaiting your command.
c834_Battle_Ready_2,Got it.
c834_Battle_Ready_3,Deploying.
c834_Reload_1,Reloading.
c834_Reload_2,Wait.
c834_Reload_3,Reload.
c834_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready for deployment.
c834_Ult_Skill_1,I won't lose.
c834_FullBurst_1,I will protect everyone.
c834_Kill_Monster_1,Switching targets.
c834_Kill_Monster_2,Target eliminated.
c834_Kill_Monster_3,Mission complete.
c834_Damage_1,Ugh...
c834_Damage_2,Mm...
c834_Damage_3,I've been attacked.
c834_Die_1,What would the original Rei Ayanami do in a situation like this?
c834_Win_1,I won.
c835_Lobby_Touch_1,What are you doing?
c835_Lobby_Touch_2,That Four-Eyed Crony has some nerve disappearing at a time like this.
c835_Lobby_Touch_3,"My appearance has something to do with Eva's cur... Never mind, it has nothing to do with you."
c835_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Don't treat me like a child.
c835_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,There are lots of weird people here. Lilins like you are rare.
c835_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"As long as you're fighting, Unit Two and I will help."
c835_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'm a bit bored, but a peaceful daily life isn't so bad either."
c835_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Bring a game console next time.
c835_Outpost_Touch_1,Get me a room that's farther away.
c835_Outpost_Touch_2,Very well. I'll protect this place as well.
c835_Outpost_Touch_3,"Shouldn't we upgrade the defenses here, Lilin?"
c835_Gacha_Get_1,"That's right, I'm Asuka. When the battle starts, stay behind me, Lilin."
c835_Reinforce_1,Isn't that obvious?
c835_Reinforce_2,"Unit Two, are you listening?"
c835_Reinforce_3,Great!
c835_Gift_1,"Ah, thank you."
c835_Gift_2,"Hmm? Trying to impress me, are you?"
c835_Gift_3,I suppose I'll have to accept it.
c835_Attractive_Up_1,"Cut my hair for me. It keeps growing, and it's rather bothersome."
c835_Attractive_Up_2,How do you even manage something this frustrating? It must be hard for you.
c835_Attractive_Up_3,"That startled me!
What was that?
Are you an idiot?"
c835_Party_Deploy_1,What about Four-Eyed Crony?
c835_Field_Touch_1,Are you stupid?
c835_Field_Go_1,Got it...
c835_Battle_Enter_1,Perfect timing.
c835_Battle_Ready_1,Deployment confirmed.
c835_Battle_Ready_2,Let's sortie.
c835_Battle_Ready_3,Cover me!
c835_Reload_1,Don't rush me!
c835_Reload_2,Reload!
c835_Reload_3,Still reloading!
c835_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Unit Two!
c835_Ult_Skill_1,Charge!
c835_FullBurst_1,Take that!
c835_Kill_Monster_1,Move!
c835_Kill_Monster_2,You're in the way!
c835_Kill_Monster_3,Next!
c835_Damage_1,Tch...
c835_Damage_2,This is the worst.
c835_Damage_3,That hurt...
c835_Die_1,Support fire is always late!
c835_Win_1,"Mission complete. Let's head back, Lilin."
c836_Lobby_Touch_1,I'm studying medicine here.
c836_Lobby_Touch_2,"Even in a world without the Evangelion war, it's still tough here..."
c836_Lobby_Touch_3,I wonder what my brother is doing in the village now...
c836_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,It's not a good idea to overwork yourself all the time.
c836_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You resemble Ms. Misato, whom I admire. Both of you are remarkable individuals."
c836_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If saving you all is what's expected of me, then leave it to me!"
c836_Lobby_Stay_1,"You might be zoning out because you're tired.
Are you sure you don't need to rest?"
c836_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Hmm? Are you asleep? You've worked yourself to the bone.
c836_Outpost_Touch_1,Where is the medical facility?
c836_Outpost_Touch_2,Do I have to live here with the Nikkes?
c836_Outpost_Touch_3,Wow! This looks even better than the previous temporary base.
c836_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Lieutenant Sakura Suzuhara, the medical officer at WILLE.
If there are any medical-related matters that need attending to, I'm the one to talk to."
c836_Reinforce_1,I'll do my best.
c836_Reinforce_2,That was a big help.
c836_Reinforce_3,Great!
c836_Gift_1,Thank you.
c836_Gift_2,You're really kind.
c836_Gift_3,Thank you.
c836_Attractive_Up_1,"You're not a Nikke, so be careful and stay safe."
c836_Attractive_Up_2,"If you're ever injured, come see me."
c836_Attractive_Up_3,I... er... I've made a personal training plan for you.
c836_Party_Deploy_1,"Shh, you need to be cautious."
c836_Field_Touch_1,Ready to go.
c836_Field_Go_1,"Awaiting your orders, Commander."
c836_Battle_Enter_1,There's an enemy!
c836_Battle_Ready_1,Pulling the trigger...
c836_Battle_Ready_2,"Everyone, be careful."
c836_Battle_Ready_3,Do we have to fight again...?
c836_Reload_1,I'm out of bullets.
c836_Reload_2,Reloading.
c836_Reload_3,Need a new magazine.
c836_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Get ready!
c836_Ult_Skill_1,"Now, stay focused."
c836_FullBurst_1,All together now!
c836_Kill_Monster_1,One down.
c836_Kill_Monster_2,Mission accomplished.
c836_Kill_Monster_3,I can do it!
c836_Damage_1,Ugh...
c836_Damage_2,Argh...
c836_Damage_3,Ouch!
c836_Die_1,I need to fall back for now. Let me take care of everyone's wounds.
c836_Win_1,"Finally, it's over."
c412_Lobby_Touch_1,"Who are these little cuties on my head, you ask?
Hehe, they're my family."
c412_Lobby_Touch_2,Can you hear the sounds of nature?
c412_Lobby_Touch_3,"Trees may seem rough and unrefined, but they actually require a delicate touch."
c412_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you're tired, you're more than free to rest in my embrace for a while."
c412_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Ahhh, the pleasant scent of phytoncides...
Oh, is that you, Sun?"
c412_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Why don't you remove your clothing and get a little closer to nature?
How about joining us, Sun?"
c412_Lobby_Stay_1,"Where did you go, Sun?
Does anyone know where Sun might be?"
c412_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Take your time; there's no rush.
My arms will always be open for you."
c412_Outpost_Touch_1,"Someday, everyone here will feel the beauty of nature, won't they?"
c412_Outpost_Touch_2,"It's amazing to see how well they've grown in an artificial environment.
Life always finds a way."
c412_Outpost_Touch_3,There are so many little ones here who require my care.
c412_Gacha_Get_1,"They call me Trina, the caretaker of trees.
You're always welcome to rest in my embrace."
c412_Reinforce_1,"I've taken one step closer to nature.
If we shed our layers here, we can take two steps forward."
c412_Reinforce_2,"Wow, the vitality is overflowing."
c412_Reinforce_3,"We must thank Sun, shouldn't we, little ones?"
c412_Gift_1,"Wow, is this a gift? 
It has been some time since I've received anything like this. I'm touched."
c412_Gift_2,The way you give so generously... you remind me of a tree with abundant fruit.
c412_Gift_3,"Thank you. Oh, do you like it as well?"
c412_Attractive_Up_1,Sun... Is it okay if I hold you close for a moment?
c412_Attractive_Up_2,Your body and spirit feel sturdier than any tree I've ever known.
c412_Attractive_Up_3,"You have this unfailing light that shines on everyone, and I want it all for myself...
Could that be considered greed?"
c412_Party_Deploy_1,Great. Are we going out for some photosynthesis?
c412_Field_Touch_1,Did you call for me?
c412_Field_Go_1,I wonder what little ones might be nearby?
c412_Battle_Enter_1,It's time to return to nature.
c412_Battle_Ready_1,"You've set your roots in the wrong place, haven't you?"
c412_Battle_Ready_2,We need to prune the unnecessary branches.
c412_Battle_Ready_3,"Careful, so the little ones don't get hurt."
c412_Reload_1,Slow and steady wins the race.
c412_Reload_2,"Gently, so the stems don't get damaged."
c412_Reload_3,"Hehe, I need to be careful."
c412_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Nature is calling to us!
c412_Ult_Skill_1,Nature... is a beautiful thing.
c412_FullBurst_1,Feel the overflowing vitality!
c412_Kill_Monster_1,This will make good compost.
c412_Kill_Monster_2,Your roots seem to be damaged.
c412_Kill_Monster_3,Return to the soil.
c412_Damage_1,That hurts!
c412_Damage_2,Ow!
c412_Damage_3,Oops...
c412_Die_1,Ugh... This doesn't feel natural...
c412_Win_1,"Hehe, finally, we've borne fruit!"
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_1,I've learned how to play an instrument to a degree.
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_2,You look happy. What's going on?
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_3,The Nikkes have told me that peace means we can throw a party anytime.
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Would you like to hear me play?
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Once we've gotten rid of the Raptures, I'll return and continue practicing."
c834_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,It's still warm.
c834_02_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm practicing.
c834_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Will there be another concert next time...?
c834_02_Outpost_Touch_1,A cat?
c834_02_Outpost_Touch_2,Are there any children in this place?
c834_02_Outpost_Touch_3,Is it my job to protect this place?
c834_02_Gacha_Get_1,Your clothes are soft.
c834_02_Reinforce_1,"It's the same as training, just with a different outfit."
c834_02_Reinforce_2,I'm used to it.
c834_02_Reinforce_3,I'm stronger now.
c834_02_Gift_1,So sparkly.
c834_02_Gift_2,Is this for me?
c834_02_Gift_3,"A performance, in return for the gift."
c834_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Everyone, play some sounds... I mean, music."
c834_02_Attractive_Up_2,Performing brings me such joy.
c834_02_Attractive_Up_3,May I keep practicing?
c834_02_Party_Deploy_1,Time to act.
c834_02_Field_Touch_1,Where are the enemies?
c834_02_Field_Go_1,"I can't hear their laughter, nor the music..."
c834_02_Battle_Enter_1,Commencing mission.
c834_02_Battle_Ready_1,Got it.
c834_02_Battle_Ready_2,Into the fray.
c834_02_Battle_Ready_3,Ready.
c834_02_Reload_1,Reloading immediately.
c834_02_Reload_2,Out of bullets.
c834_02_Reload_3,Reloading bullets.
c834_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Ready signal.
c834_02_Ult_Skill_1,Witness my strength.
c834_02_FullBurst_1,I'll take them all down.
c834_02_Kill_Monster_1,Target eliminated.
c834_02_Kill_Monster_2,Let's keep going.
c834_02_Kill_Monster_3,Yet another enemy...
c834_02_Damage_1,Ugh...
c834_02_Damage_2,Ahh...
c834_02_Damage_3,My instrument...!
c834_02_Die_1,I wanted to be with everyone...
c834_02_Win_1,"We won, so shouldn't we be celebrating?"
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_1,Never thought I'd wear formal attire. I'm usually ready for battle at all times.
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"What's Four-Eyed Crony doing in the band? Ugh, this sucks."
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"Hey, don't look so surprised! It stands to reason someone as talented as I could handle an instrument."
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You're surprisingly laidback in situations like this, Four-Eyed Crony."
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Lilin and Nikkes both seem to have an affinity for music, and that's good enough for me."
c835_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"When I was a Lilin, I used to play instruments.
Why? I'm not so sure myself."
c835_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"My hair is still growing... Oh well, it suits the look."
c835_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Tired? Good. I can't stand noisy things.
c835_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"You're thinking of throwing a party in a place like this?
Shouldn't you decorate it some more?"
c835_02_Outpost_Touch_2,So this is where you feel most comfortable... I see.
c835_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"This place is halfway decent. If I get the chance... Never mind, forget I said anything."
c835_02_Gacha_Get_1,"I know that you invited me to the party, but I've never dressed like this before."
c835_02_Reinforce_1,Switching to new gear!
c835_02_Reinforce_2,"Aren't Nikkes able to fight no matter what they wear?
So can I."
c835_02_Reinforce_3,You must always be thoroughly prepared for any emergencies.
c835_02_Gift_1,"The curtain call hasn't come yet, so don't rush in with the gifts."
c835_02_Gift_2,I've told you before not to get it twisted; I'm not a superstar.
c835_02_Gift_3,"The party's not bad, and I like your gift. Thanks."
c835_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Hold on, why are you turning down this gift? I'm not a superstar, you know."
c835_02_Attractive_Up_2,"I smile more often now?
Don't be ridiculous."
c835_02_Attractive_Up_3,"I've already adapted here, so you don't have to avoid me anymore.
Isn't this how it's supposed to be?"
c835_02_Party_Deploy_1,I don't care about stuff like that!
c835_02_Field_Touch_1,When can I go back and change out of these clothes?
c835_02_Field_Go_1,These clothes are so annoying!
c835_02_Battle_Enter_1,"All right, emergency sortie!"
c835_02_Battle_Ready_1,Hurry up and deal with it!
c835_02_Battle_Ready_2,It's already started.
c835_02_Battle_Ready_3,"Tch, why now of all times?"
c835_02_Reload_1,Out of bullets.
c835_02_Reload_2,How did an instrument end up here...!
c835_02_Reload_3,Pass me the magazine.
c835_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Get rough with them!
c835_02_Ult_Skill_1,"Unit Two, restart!"
c835_02_FullBurst_1,It's time for the climax!
c835_02_Kill_Monster_1,That was simple.
c835_02_Kill_Monster_2,Weak.
c835_02_Kill_Monster_3,So irritating!
c835_02_Damage_1,Ugh...
c835_02_Damage_2,I've been hit!
c835_02_Damage_3,That's dirty!
c835_02_Die_1,Argh! You nasty bugger!
c835_02_Win_1,"This is worse than emergency training.
Let's head back, Lilin."
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_1,Impressive. You know exactly what gift to pick out for a girl. You must be popular with the ladies.
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_2,What exciting things could happen at the party?
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_3,"There are so many cute Nikkes.
It's heartbreaking to see them dragged into battle..."
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,How would you look in this? I should choose something stylish for you.
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,A band or something similar would add some elegance to the banquet.
c832_04_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"It's an evening party, and I'm the shining star!"
c832_04_Lobby_Stay_1,Phew... Should I take this chance to explore the Ark?
c832_04_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It's poor form to bore a beauty like me, you know."
c832_04_Outpost_Touch_1,This place would be perfect for hosting a small concert.
c832_04_Outpost_Touch_2,"I've seen this base so much, that I'm getting used to it."
c832_04_Outpost_Touch_3,Hmm... I wonder if it's okay to enjoy a rural life looking like this.
c832_04_Gacha_Get_1,It's been ages since I've felt so intellectually stimulated.
c832_04_Reinforce_1,Thank you.
c832_04_Reinforce_2,"Oooh, I'm digging this vibe!"
c832_04_Reinforce_3,Feels like I'm doing an emergency drill again.
c832_04_Gift_1,"You're so polite, aren't you, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
c832_04_Gift_2,Huh? Did you come here to offer me flowers?
c832_04_Gift_3,"A lovely gift like this really suits me, don't you think?"
c832_04_Attractive_Up_1,"Nihao! Mari Makinami Illustrious, coming to you more radiant than ever!"
c832_04_Attractive_Up_2,"If I did this, would it surprise you? Hehe."
c832_04_Attractive_Up_3,"You're really putting in the effort. Good job, very good job."
c832_04_Party_Deploy_1,Girls don't dress up just to fight.
c832_04_Field_Touch_1,"There aren't any enemies around, so let's light a campfire."
c832_04_Field_Go_1,Nya nya nya♫♪♪
c832_04_Battle_Enter_1,Got it!
c832_04_Battle_Ready_1,"Okay, okay!"
c832_04_Battle_Ready_2,"Hey, come on!"
c832_04_Battle_Ready_3,Target locked!
c832_04_Reload_1,Gotta reload.
c832_04_Reload_2,Not yet.
c832_04_Reload_3,Almost there.
c832_04_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"From now on, I won't be acting ladylike."
c832_04_Ult_Skill_1,I won't miss!
c832_04_FullBurst_1,Hyah! Nya nya nya♫♪♪
c832_04_Kill_Monster_1,Désolée!
c832_04_Kill_Monster_2,Zaijian!
c832_04_Kill_Monster_3,Toodle-oo!
c832_04_Damage_1,Oh?
c832_04_Damage_2,I got hurt.
c832_04_Damage_3,Ugh...
c832_04_Die_1,How mortifying... I suppose I have no choice but to retreat for now.
c832_04_Win_1,"Heh heh, piece of cake!"
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"An emergency? I'll get changed into my uniform and head out right away! 
... What? That's not necessary?"
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"I'm taking a steam bath.
I'm almost done, so I'll get back to the mission soon."
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm sure the bathroom is a bit warm due to all the steam.
Sorry, I'll get ready as quickly as I can and go out."
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It's strange... I feel like I'm becoming more conscious of your gaze...
Can I get changed and come back?"
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"It makes me feel a bit self-conscious with you watching...
Er, could you look away for a moment?"
c352_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Getting a good steam is quite therapeutic.
You should give it a try sometime, Subordinate."
c352_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"If you're busy, I can go get some things prepared."
c352_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"If you have something urgent to take care of, go ahead.
I'll be soaking my feet in the meantime."
c352_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"Do you think we could fill the Outpost's pool with warm water?
I'd love for everyone to experience what it's like to have a nice, hot soak."
c352_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"Now that I think about it, don't you have a bathtub in your room?
I think it'd be great for you to have a steam sometime."
c352_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"What's my favorite bath toy? 
Not sure... Although I think I would like having a miniature of the Admire."
c352_02_Gacha_Get_1,"Being in warm water feels much better than I thought. 
Would you like to try it for yourself later?"
c352_02_Reinforce_1,Is this thanks to all those steam treatments...?
c352_02_Reinforce_2,Thanks for giving me time to regroup.
c352_02_Reinforce_3,I couldn't have done this without your support. I'll repay you with stellar results.
c352_02_Gift_1,I... I'm not really sure how I should express my gratitude. Thank you so much.
c352_02_Gift_2,You know what I like better than I do.
c352_02_Gift_3,"Thanks to you, I can feel this warmth filling up my heart."
c352_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Lately, my mind goes a bit fuzzy whenever I see you.
Could it be because I stayed in the bath for too long?"
c352_02_Attractive_Up_2,"I'd love for us to be alone together forever,
even though I know that's impossible."
c352_02_Attractive_Up_3,This feeling of warmth that you give me is something I'll cherish forever.
c352_02_Party_Deploy_1,"Right now? Er... Okay, no problem."
c352_02_Field_Touch_1,Standing by.
c352_02_Field_Go_1,"Yes, understood."
c352_02_Battle_Enter_1,"Everyone, prepare for battle!"
c352_02_Battle_Ready_1,Don't worry about me. My body is in perfect condition.
c352_02_Battle_Ready_2,I'm going to finish this quickly and get back to the warm water.
c352_02_Battle_Ready_3,Time to show what steam treatments can do.
c352_02_Reload_1,"Dang it, my hands are too slippery."
c352_02_Reload_2,Careful now... Let's go again.
c352_02_Reload_3,Back to it.
c352_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c352_02_Ult_Skill_1,"Will you join me, Subordinate?"
c352_02_FullBurst_1,The time has come! Let's give it our all!
c352_02_Kill_Monster_1,Resolved!
c352_02_Kill_Monster_2,Gotta go faster!
c352_02_Kill_Monster_3,There's no escape!
c352_02_Damage_1,Ugh!
c352_02_Damage_2,Gah!
c352_02_Damage_3,Argh!
c352_02_Die_1,"I... I'm sorry for failing you, Subordinate."
c352_02_Win_1,"Whew... I'm glad that's all resolved, but now I need to wash up again."
c520_Lobby_Touch_1,"Let me know if you're hungry.
I'll invite you to our kitchen."
c520_Lobby_Touch_2,Did you bring the food? Can I have some?
c520_Lobby_Touch_3,"*Nibble nibble* Mmm, delicious."
c520_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Bonne Bouche, you look as scrumptious as ever.
May I have a bite later?"
c520_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"*Nibble nibble* What is it? Are you ticklish?
I still want to taste you some more, so please bear with me for a moment."
c520_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I know it's unfair that I'm always the one munching on you...
Would you like to try it too?"
c520_Lobby_Stay_1,When are you getting back? I'm hungry.
c520_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I have to admit, waiting for you does make me appreciate the feeling of hunger a little more."
c520_Outpost_Touch_1,No one can come to our kitchen unless they are invited.
c520_Outpost_Touch_2,Do you have any tasty treats?
c520_Outpost_Touch_3,"I'm gonna get something to eat.
Personally, I recommend the Maid Cafe."
c520_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm hungry. Have you got anything to eat, perchance?"
c520_Reinforce_1,I think my tongue has become more sensitive.
c520_Reinforce_2,What a thrilling flavor! This is fun.
c520_Reinforce_3,Interesting... I actually feel slightly full.
c520_Gift_1,I'm curious what this will taste like.
c520_Gift_2,Thanks. I'll eat it when I get hungry.
c520_Gift_3,"Anyone who gives me something to eat, like you, must be a good person."
c520_Attractive_Up_1,"Bonne Bouche, you're getting tastier with every passing day."
c520_Attractive_Up_2,"I want you to feed me the next item on the menu, Bonne Bouche."
c520_Attractive_Up_3,Just looking at you is enough to make me feel full.
c520_Party_Deploy_1,What's on the menu?
c520_Field_Touch_1,Did you call?
c520_Field_Go_1,I found something that looks delicious.
c520_Battle_Enter_1,The menu here is lacking.
c520_Battle_Ready_1,This all looks rather unappetizing.
c520_Battle_Ready_2,This barely even counts as a snack.
c520_Battle_Ready_3,Let's finish up quickly and go eat something nice.
c520_Reload_1,"Just a moment, let me digest."
c520_Reload_2,I'm really craving something tasty.
c520_Reload_3,Refilling.
c520_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm famished!
c520_Ult_Skill_1,I'll eat every last morsel!
c520_FullBurst_1,Let's eat together!
c520_Kill_Monster_1,One more plate.
c520_Kill_Monster_2,Tasting finished.
c520_Kill_Monster_3,Main dish finished.
c520_Damage_1,Ouch.
c520_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c520_Damage_3,That hurts!
c520_Die_1,Urgh... Can't gather strength... too hungry...
c520_Win_1,That was a filling meal. What's next on the menu?
c521_Lobby_Touch_1,"I've prepared a multi-course meal today, all centered around seafood! You're gonna love it, hehe."
c521_Lobby_Touch_2,"I'm also the host of the Crunchy Cooking Class.
If you have some free time, be sure to check it out!"
c521_Lobby_Touch_3,"I'm in charge of cooking, and Bready is in charge of tasting. 
It's a match made in heaven!"
c521_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,I wonder what you'll think of today's dish? My heart is beating like crazy!
c521_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"You're welcome to visit the kitchen anytime, Mr. Gourmand!
Very few people have that kind of access, so be sure not to tell anyone!"
c521_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I've made a special dish just for you, Mr. Gourmand.
Enjoy!"
c521_Lobby_Stay_1,Mr. Gourmand? Where did you go? It's almost time to eat.
c521_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I packed you a warm meal in this lunchbox!
Make sure to eat it when you get back, hehe."
c521_Outpost_Touch_1,"I'm hard at work researching various dishes.
Be sure to encourage me whenever you can!"
c521_Outpost_Touch_2,"You should never skip a meal!
You need to eat well to have energy!"
c521_Outpost_Touch_3,"There don't seem to be many restaurants at the Outpost.
Is everyone here getting enough to eat?"
c521_Gacha_Get_1,"I, Crust, will make loads of delicious dishes for you!"
c521_Reinforce_1,"Wow, I feel like I'll be able to make more dishes than ever!"
c521_Reinforce_2,"Wow, this is...! I just thought of an incredible recipe!"
c521_Reinforce_3,I feel a tingling in my fingertips. Could it be... my cooking skills are awakening?!
c521_Gift_1,"Mr. Gourmand, you shouldn't have!
This won't do. Come follow me to the kitchen right away!"
c521_Gift_2,Thank you! Thank you so much!
c521_Gift_3,"How could I ever repay you, Mr. Gourmand? Oooh, maybe I can become your personal chef?"
c521_Attractive_Up_1,It'd make me so happy if you enjoyed my cooking every single day!
c521_Attractive_Up_2,My heart flutters every time you taste my cooking.
c521_Attractive_Up_3,I'll make sure that you never have another bad meal for the rest of your life!
c521_Party_Deploy_1,Did someone call for a chef?
c521_Field_Touch_1,Yes!
c521_Field_Go_1,"Oooh, I've never seen these types of ingredients before."
c521_Battle_Enter_1,Quite a bunch of bad apples here.
c521_Battle_Ready_1,Let me do the dishes real quick.
c521_Battle_Ready_2,I'll have to wrap this up before the food gets cold.
c521_Battle_Ready_3,"Once I'm done, I'll make you something tasty."
c521_Reload_1,Bubble bubble! Sizzle sizzle!
c521_Reload_2,Cooking these guys up is a real hassle.
c521_Reload_3,Time to add some seasoning.
c521_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,All the ingredients are gathered!
c521_Ult_Skill_1,I'll pour my heart into this dish!
c521_FullBurst_1,Enjoy your meal!
c521_Kill_Monster_1,"One more plate, coming up!"
c521_Kill_Monster_2,The dishes are done!
c521_Kill_Monster_3,The ingredients are prepped!
c521_Damage_1,Agh!
c521_Damage_2,Wahh!
c521_Damage_3,Ouuch...!
c521_Die_1,Urgh... I wasn't able to complete the dish...
c521_Win_1,"All finished cooking! Now then, what do you say we sit down for a nice meal?"
c513_Lobby_Touch_1,What should I create with my bubbles today...
c513_Lobby_Touch_2,"I should keep talking, or else I might forget how to speak."
c513_Lobby_Touch_3,"Ah uh ah... Oh right, I can speak normally."
c513_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Now I can recreate my old friends perfectly, hehe."
c513_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,I will treasure the strength that Abe gave me and use it for good.
c513_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,Let's make sure to reach the end of this story together.
c513_Lobby_Stay_1,"... As I expected, it's lonely with no one else around."
c513_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It's okay, I can wait.
I'm sure we'll see each other again, anyway."
c513_Outpost_Touch_1,"This is a nice place. If we had all lived together in a place like this, I wonder what it would have been like?"
c513_Outpost_Touch_2,I think this building would look lovely decorated with water droplets.
c513_Outpost_Touch_3,This place is so full of life. I hope everyone here will live a full and happy life.
c513_Gacha_Get_1,"I will never fall, never falter, for I must keep the promise I made to everyone."
c513_Reinforce_1,I can make even more bubbles now.
c513_Reinforce_2,"Now, I'll be able to protect everyone."
c513_Reinforce_3,"If Abe could see me now, I'm sure she'd lavish me with praise, hehe."
c513_Gift_1,This is perfect! Just what I needed.
c513_Gift_2,Hansel and Gretel would have loved this even more than me.
c513_Gift_3,"I'll set this to the side, and show it off the next time I see everyone, hehe."
c513_Attractive_Up_1,"It feels so soft and squishy, just like bubbles."
c513_Attractive_Up_2,I can feel my loneliness being replaced with happiness.
c513_Attractive_Up_3,This warm feeling... it's the same as being inside a bubble.
c513_Party_Deploy_1,Let's go and find everyone.
c513_Field_Touch_1,Did you call me?
c513_Field_Go_1,The bubbles will show us the way.
c513_Battle_Enter_1,I will turn everything into bubbles.
c513_Battle_Ready_1,My voice is ready.
c513_Battle_Ready_2,"Let's go, everyone."
c513_Battle_Ready_3,I'm not alone. We're all in this together.
c513_Reload_1,Let me clear my throat...
c513_Reload_2,"Regroup, and let's go again."
c513_Reload_3,I'll do my best. Cheer me on.
c513_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Bubbles!
c513_Ult_Skill_1,Tell me the story of victory.
c513_FullBurst_1,Go forth!
c513_Kill_Monster_1,Good job.
c513_Kill_Monster_2,"Let's keep going, just a little bit more!"
c513_Kill_Monster_3,"Yes, good."
c513_Damage_1,Ah...!
c513_Damage_2,Ugh!
c513_Damage_3,That hurt...
c513_Die_1,This won't do... but we mustn't give up. We must try again.
c513_Win_1,The story will be rewritten into a tale that's happy and beautiful.
c162_Lobby_Touch_1,"I think these changes in my body have made me more sensitive.
Now I can enjoy even deeper sensations."
c162_Lobby_Touch_2,So this is what it feels like to be shackled?
c162_Lobby_Touch_3,"With this body, I think I'll be able to try out even more things, haha."
c162_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"The pain whenever I see Yuni is immense...
It's something I'll never forget."
c162_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,There's no greater thrill than when your life is on the line!
c162_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,To have a relationship where we inflict and endure pain together... wouldn't that be perfect?
c162_Lobby_Stay_1,"I can't afford to be alone like this.
I'm sorry, but can I go to Yuni?"
c162_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"It's okay, I can wait for a bit.
Anxiety can be exciting for me, too."
c162_Outpost_Touch_1,"""Seedy Club?"" A rather unusual name... but I like it."
c162_Outpost_Touch_2,"That's strange. I don't remember ever having been here, but this place feels so familiar somehow."
c162_Outpost_Touch_3,Do you think Yuni and I will fit in here? It's such a bright and lively place.
c162_Gacha_Get_1,"Living life on the edge, with a bomb strapped to your back. What could be more thrilling than that?"
c162_Reinforce_1,"I feel like my skin is thinner than before.
That must mean I'll be able to feel more, right?"
c162_Reinforce_2,"I need to keep myself healthy, so that I can protect Yuni."
c162_Reinforce_3,"Hmm, this feels nice.
Such sensations feel pretty good too."
c162_Gift_1,Haha. Yuni would get a kick out of this.
c162_Gift_2,"This is my first time seeing this, but it feels familiar. I'll make good use of this."
c162_Gift_3,"How should I repay you?
I wonder if you and I have similar tastes? Haha."
c162_Attractive_Up_1,"This feeling, this sensation... I've felt it before. 
Would you show me a little more?"
c162_Attractive_Up_2,You really do understand. I like that.
c162_Attractive_Up_3,Is this what it means when they say existence itself is stimulating?
c162_Party_Deploy_1,"Shall we go, Yuni?"
c162_Field_Touch_1,Could you press a little harder?
c162_Field_Go_1,Keep showing us the way!
c162_Battle_Enter_1,Enough business. Time for pleasure.
c162_Battle_Ready_1,This is going to be fun.
c162_Battle_Ready_2,Push me to my limit.
c162_Battle_Ready_3,I'm not sure if I can hit hard enough...
c162_Reload_1,I'm getting more and more excited!
c162_Reload_2,"Just a second, Yuni."
c162_Reload_3,I just got hit. It felt good.
c162_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I can't hold back...
c162_Ult_Skill_1,"Quietly, fully, restrain me."
c162_FullBurst_1,Let's all enjoy this together.
c162_Kill_Monster_1,This isn't bad either.
c162_Kill_Monster_2,So weak.
c162_Kill_Monster_3,"I'm pretty good too, aren't I?"
c162_Damage_1,Urgh...!
c162_Damage_2,Right there!
c162_Damage_3,Ahh...!
c162_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Yuni. I must have enjoyed it too much."
c162_Win_1,It's already over? That's a shame. It felt good. Haha.
c590_Lobby_Touch_1,What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen anyone eat before?
c590_Lobby_Touch_2,"Stay out of my hair, and I'll do the same for you."
c590_Lobby_Touch_3,What am I supposed to do here?
c590_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Huh? You're giving me something to eat?
... You're a better person than I expected."
c590_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,If it's you we're talking about... I suppose I can share a piece of bread.
c590_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I lack in a lot of areas, but I'll do the best I can."
c590_Lobby_Stay_1,"I know I don't have much to offer, but leaving me like this is still a bit uncalled for..."
c590_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I can have breaks now? What a life.
I can't remember the last time I was this at ease."
c590_Outpost_Touch_1,What is it? Is there something you want me to do?
c590_Outpost_Touch_2,"Everyone here looks so happy.
... Unlike me."
c590_Outpost_Touch_3,"I see a lot of different shops, but it seems like I don't really belong anywhere."
c590_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm Mori, a member of the Incubator Squad.
... Call me if you need me to do anything."
c590_Reinforce_1,"Don't waste your time and money on me.
I won't be of any help to you anyway."
c590_Reinforce_2,Why do you insist on having expectations of me? It's a real burden on me.
c590_Reinforce_3,"... I'll try my best to do what I can, so just hold on a minute."
c590_Gift_1,"Why are you giving me this...?
I don't have anything to give you..."
c590_Gift_2,"Um... er...
Thank you..."
c590_Gift_3,Wow... I've never received anything like this before.
c590_Attractive_Up_1,"How nice would it be if the world were made up entirely of people like you, Evaluator?"
c590_Attractive_Up_2,"Thanks to you, I smiled for the first time in a long while."
c590_Attractive_Up_3,"If I'd met you earlier, do you think my life would have turned out differently?"
c590_Party_Deploy_1,"Even if you bring me along, I won't be of any help."
c590_Field_Touch_1,What's up?
c590_Field_Go_1,Moving out.
c590_Battle_Enter_1,Gah! Rapture!
c590_Battle_Ready_1,"Screw it, whatever happens, happens!"
c590_Battle_Ready_2,Can I do this...?
c590_Battle_Ready_3,... All right! Let's do this!
c590_Reload_1,Re-reloading!
c590_Reload_2,Huff...! Huff...!
c590_Reload_3,Wait! I said wait!
c590_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready!
c590_Ult_Skill_1,"I-I'll eat quickly, so stop staring!"
c590_FullBurst_1,Ughh... Let's go!!
c590_Kill_Monster_1,I took it down!
c590_Kill_Monster_2,Did you see that?!
c590_Kill_Monster_3,It worked!
c590_Damage_1,Nngh!
c590_Damage_2,Agh!
c590_Damage_3,Ugh!
c590_Die_1,I told you... I'm no help at all...
c590_Win_1,That... actually worked? Am I not entirely worthless in battle?
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_1,Do I look like an ordinary person? That would be great if you think so.
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"These clothes feel awkward.
I don't think I could wear them all the time."
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_3,This fabric isn't very form-fitting. It might be uncomfortable to move around in.
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Cinderella said I looked beautiful, and that's all that matters."
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Regardless of what I wear, my job doesn't change.
I will stand by Cinderella's side and rewrite our story."
c514_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Why are you staring? Are you eyeing my clothes?
Cinderella picked them out for me. I can't give them away, not even to you, Superhuman."
c514_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"What are you doing? If you have nothing to say, I'll go see Cinderella."
c514_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm not afraid of waiting anymore.
I know there will always be a day when you return."
c514_01_Outpost_Touch_1,This is a great place to take a walk with Cinderella.
c514_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"It's lively here.
But honestly, where we are right now feels just as spirited."
c514_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"If I get the chance, I'd like to pick out some other outfits here.
... For Cinderella, that is."
c514_01_Gacha_Get_1,Cinderella chose this for me. Does it suit me?
c514_01_Reinforce_1,Not yet. I still have to become stronger.
c514_01_Reinforce_2,Being strong means being beautiful... Am I beautiful?
c514_01_Reinforce_3,I'll protect both you and Cinderella.
c514_01_Gift_1,This will go well with my outfit. Thanks.
c514_01_Gift_2,I'll share it with Cinderella.
c514_01_Gift_3,"Someday, I'll make sure to repay you, Superhuman."
c514_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Thanks to you, I understand what the meaning of trust is. Thank you."
c514_01_Attractive_Up_2,"In the past, I never could have imagined being able to wear ordinary clothes and walk around with Cinderella...
I'm so happy."
c514_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Superhuman, I'm curious about your story too.
Will you tell me someday, when the time is right?"
c514_01_Party_Deploy_1,I'll go with you.
c514_01_Field_Touch_1,Did you call me?
c514_01_Field_Go_1,Moving out.
c514_01_Battle_Enter_1,Stand back. I'll protect you.
c514_01_Battle_Ready_1,I won't let you get away.
c514_01_Battle_Ready_2,Don't wrinkle my clothes.
c514_01_Battle_Ready_3,We have to fight carefully.
c514_01_Reload_1,Let's go again.
c514_01_Reload_2,Is my outfit okay?
c514_01_Reload_3,I can still fight.
c514_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c514_01_Ult_Skill_1,I'm going all out!
c514_01_FullBurst_1,Let's take them down together!
c514_01_Kill_Monster_1,It's taken care of.
c514_01_Kill_Monster_2,That should do it.
c514_01_Kill_Monster_3,Next.
c514_01_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c514_01_Damage_2,I can take it...!
c514_01_Damage_3,Urgh!
c514_01_Die_1,The outfit Cinderella picked out... it's ruined...
c514_01_Win_1,Let's get back to our daily lives. Cinderella will be waiting for us.
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_1,I feel like I have become one with the bubbles.
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"I hope that one day, I can show this place to everyone. My own space."
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"Someday, will I be able to swim freely outside these bubbles?"
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If Cinderella saw me like this, she would say I look beautiful, right?"
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,La la la~ La la la la~♬
c513_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"It's so warm in here.
It feels like everyone is embracing me."
c513_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"I got all dressed up, but there's no one here to show off to..."
c513_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"If I wear a dress like this and wait,
it feels like a prince is going to come looking for me. Hehe."
c513_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"When I'm here, I don't feel so lonely anymore."
c513_01_Outpost_Touch_2,Will I be able to become friends with everyone here someday?
c513_01_Outpost_Touch_3,Everyone here looks so happy and free. It's incredibly admirable.
c513_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I feel like a fish that is free to swim wherever it pleases.
Would you like to come with me?"
c513_01_Reinforce_1,The bubbles have become stronger.
c513_01_Reinforce_2,It feels like I'm overflowing with energy.
c513_01_Reinforce_3,"So much time has passed. I'm sure everyone's grown stronger in the meantime, so I can't fall behind!"
c513_01_Gift_1,"Wow, this would go perfectly with my current outfit!"
c513_01_Gift_2,I'll keep it safe and sound inside the bubbles. Hehe.
c513_01_Gift_3,Can I share it with the fish too?
c513_01_Attractive_Up_1,I adore it so much!
c513_01_Attractive_Up_2,"It feels so soft, warm and comforting—just like bubbles."
c513_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Like sunlight that brightens the deep, dark recesses of the sea."
c513_01_Party_Deploy_1,Shall I swim over there?
c513_01_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, I'm here."
c513_01_Field_Go_1,*Blub* *Blub*
c513_01_Battle_Enter_1,Let's chase away these bad fish.
c513_01_Battle_Ready_1,Bubbles at the ready.
c513_01_Battle_Ready_2,"I'm counting on you, guys."
c513_01_Battle_Ready_3,Let's put some gusto into our swimming.
c513_01_Reload_1,*Bubble* *Bubble*
c513_01_Reload_2,"Ah... Yes, my voice is fine."
c513_01_Reload_3,"Next time, I'll be even faster."
c513_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"Everyone, hold your breath."
c513_01_Ult_Skill_1,Swim with all your might toward the light...!
c513_01_FullBurst_1,Charge forward quickly!
c513_01_Kill_Monster_1,"Well done, everyone."
c513_01_Kill_Monster_2,Next.
c513_01_Kill_Monster_3,We drove them away!
c513_01_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c513_01_Damage_2,Ngh!
c513_01_Damage_3,Ow...!
c513_01_Die_1,I won't be able to swim freely like this...
c513_01_Win_1,The waves have calmed. Why don't we swim towards the next story?
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"Still too weak.
Can't you do it a little harder?"
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_2,When are you finally going to let go of your reservations and let me enjoy this fully?
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you're under some stress, feel free to take it out on me, hehe."
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I think I've become accustomed to these things... 
Unless it's a stronger stimulus, my body won't even react anymore."
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"My body has become quite sensitive.
Please, keep going."
c162_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I've never met someone I could speak with so easily.
Let's talk all night! Hehe!"
c162_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"You're not going to leave me like this, are you?
My body is getting restless..."
c162_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"The way you're looking at me, it's like you want to devour me.
If you're going to make a move, take it slow and savor every moment. Hehe."
c162_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"I'll be waiting for you tonight, hehe."
c162_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Isn't there somewhere darker or quieter we can go?
It's too bright here."
c162_01_Outpost_Touch_3,I don't see anyone here worth conversing with.
c162_01_Gacha_Get_1,"You know the rules. 
Answer me with your actions."
c162_01_Reinforce_1,"Now that you've become stronger, go harder."
c162_01_Reinforce_2,"Your stamina has improved, so now we can last longer."
c162_01_Reinforce_3,There's no time to rest. Let's keep going.
c162_01_Gift_1,"This doesn't seem like a gift just for me.
Hehe, we can both put it to good use later."
c162_01_Gift_2,"Oh, so this is what you're into? I'll keep that in mind."
c162_01_Gift_3,"Since I received a gift, I'll have to put in more effort today. Hehe."
c162_01_Attractive_Up_1,You've managed to make me a very eager girl. I'm impressed.
c162_01_Attractive_Up_2,I want to have even more conversations with you.
c162_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Oh dear, it looks like you've captured both my body and mind, hehe."
c162_01_Party_Deploy_1,"All right, let's go."
c162_01_Field_Touch_1,"Mmh, right there, that's good."
c162_01_Field_Go_1,Be rough with me.
c162_01_Battle_Enter_1,Hehe. What kind of thrill will you give me?
c162_01_Battle_Ready_1,Let me tease you.
c162_01_Battle_Ready_2,"I'm right here, try and hit me!"
c162_01_Battle_Ready_3,Just don't finish too quickly.
c162_01_Reload_1,It was just starting to get good.
c162_01_Reload_2,We can't let our conversations get interrupted.
c162_01_Reload_3,Hehe. Ahaha!
c162_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I can feel it.
c162_01_Ult_Skill_1,Harder... Just a bit harder...!
c162_01_FullBurst_1,Swing wildly!
c162_01_Kill_Monster_1,Maybe that was too intense.
c162_01_Kill_Monster_2,It's over already?
c162_01_Kill_Monster_3,Is this one next?
c162_01_Damage_1,Urgh...!
c162_01_Damage_2,A little more!
c162_01_Damage_3,Ahah...!
c162_01_Die_1,Hehe... I'm out of breath. I can't go on.
c162_01_Win_1,"Hmm, not quite enough. Why don't we continue for a little while longer? Hehe."
c581_Lobby_Touch_1,"Oh dear... are you okay? I'm good at reading faces, and yours is giving off great misfortune in love."
c581_Lobby_Touch_2,Sharing a secret has brought us closer together. Promise to keep it that way!
c581_Lobby_Touch_3,"Did you know? The amount of information on you in the Forbidden Library just keeps growing and growing.
Personally, as a fan, I'm quite proud of that fact!"
c581_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Your fortune today is... to be with me all day long!
c581_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Apparently, people find women who are business-oriented extremely attractive.
How about me? Do you find me attractive?"
c581_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I'm no mere fan anymore, but being your girlfriend seems a little too basic... How about wife?"
c581_Lobby_Stay_1,"If you leave me here, I might die of loneliness!"
c581_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I must be crazy. Just looking at you fills me with joy.
Huh?! Er... I meant for you to hear that!"
c581_Outpost_Touch_1,This place seems much livelier than the Ark.
c581_Outpost_Touch_2,"Oh, I was just taking in the surroundings... okay, fine, I was staring at you. Running into each other like this must be fate. Do you have a moment?"
c581_Outpost_Touch_3,Come get your tarot reading. First customer gets half off!
c581_Gacha_Get_1,"The cold, ruthless, and professional guardian of secrets, Arcana, has arrived!
... Nice to meet you. I missed you."
c581_Reinforce_1,The goddess of fate is smiling upon me!
c581_Reinforce_2,"Any chance other parts of me could improve too?
Like my complexion becoming more radiant, or my hair becoming shinier?"
c581_Reinforce_3,"If I keep this up, I may end up becoming too strong. What happens then?"
c581_Gift_1,I'll make sure to repay you later.
c581_Gift_2,"{AccountData.NickName}, do you like me, by any chance?"
c581_Gift_3,... Thank you. I'm really happy.
c581_Attractive_Up_1,Wow. What happens if it gets better than this?
c581_Attractive_Up_2,I guess there really is such a thing as soulmates.
c581_Attractive_Up_3,"I'm really glad that I met you, {AccountData.NickName}."
c581_Party_Deploy_1,"You know I'm not very good at fighting, right?"
c581_Field_Touch_1,"Wait, I'm mentally preparing."
c581_Field_Go_1,I should have worked out more.
c581_Battle_Enter_1,"Since I'm here, I might as well show that I'm serious."
c581_Battle_Ready_1,"Whatever happens, happens."
c581_Battle_Ready_2,I'm a woman who gets things done.
c581_Battle_Ready_3,I've still not given up on being an assassin.
c581_Reload_1,All right! Reload!
c581_Reload_2,This is easier than I thought.
c581_Reload_3,"Like this, and like that..."
c581_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Fate is calling us!
c581_Ult_Skill_1,I shall decide your destiny!
c581_FullBurst_1,I am your doom!
c581_Kill_Monster_1,Go-gotcha!
c581_Kill_Monster_2,That actually worked?
c581_Kill_Monster_3,Did you see that? It went down!
c581_Damage_1,Aah!
c581_Damage_2,*Sob*
c581_Damage_3,Ugh.
c581_Die_1,This wasn't the fate I had foretold...
c581_Win_1,"Did you see that? How was it? It was cool, right? Did you fall for me?"
c041_Lobby_Touch_1,Why do you keep bothering me? Got a death wish or something?!
c041_Lobby_Touch_2,Do I look like a pushover to you?! Huh?!
c041_Lobby_Touch_3,"Argh, so irritating!"
c041_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Tch... I'm only putting up with this because it's you. Got it?
c041_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you've got something to say, then spit it out."
c041_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Everyone else just pisses me off.
But with you... it's like my head clears."
c041_Lobby_Stay_1,"You call me over here, and now you're doing something else? Hey!"
c041_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,You've got some nerve to call me here and then run off to do something else.
c041_Outpost_Touch_1,"If you wanna rest, just go to the hotel."
c041_Outpost_Touch_2,"There aren't any humans here. That's why I like this place. Oh, right, I forgot you're a human."
c041_Outpost_Touch_3,Is there anyone you'd like to bump off?
c041_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm in a surly mood. If there's anyone you want offed, feel free to tell me."
c041_Reinforce_1,Now I feel like I can cut loose.
c041_Reinforce_2,"Oh, that's good."
c041_Reinforce_3,Thanks for the support.
c041_Gift_1,Huh? This is for me?
c041_Gift_2,"There's not a bomb inside or anything, is there?"
c041_Gift_3,... Thank you.
c041_Attractive_Up_1,"Whenever I see you lately, I get so flustered and... Ugh, I don't even know! I'm not even acting like myself!"
c041_Attractive_Up_2,"If there were more humans like you around, life might be more tolerable."
c041_Attractive_Up_3,Wh... Why do you always make people worry about you?!
c041_Party_Deploy_1,I briefed myself on the mission earlier.
c041_Field_Touch_1,Why the hell?
c041_Field_Go_1,I'm going.
c041_Battle_Enter_1,Target sighted!
c041_Battle_Ready_1,I'll kill you all!
c041_Battle_Ready_2,Time to take out the trash.
c041_Battle_Ready_3,This oughta be fun.
c041_Reload_1,Wait a moment!
c041_Reload_2,Reloading!
c041_Reload_3,"Hurry, hurry!"
c041_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Charging complete!
c041_Ult_Skill_1,I'm gonna roast you all alive!
c041_FullBurst_1,Time to wrap this up.
c041_Kill_Monster_1,Haha!
c041_Kill_Monster_2,That was nothing.
c041_Kill_Monster_3,Next!
c041_Damage_1,Ouch!
c041_Damage_2,Argh!
c041_Damage_3,Ugh!
c041_Die_1,You couldn't even command properly!
c041_Win_1,That was a simple mission.
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_1,I'll give you luck and victory to go with it!
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"This is a special uniform for cheering at baseball games. 
Does it suit me?"
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"Noir? Of course, she came with me.
After all, the bunny twins wouldn't be complete with just one of us!"
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"How do I look? It feels different from usual, don't you think?"
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Pit Boss, let's go on a date to the baseball stadium sometime.
Noir's coming too, of course!"
c270_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Have you heard of Kiss Cam? 
When a couple shows up on the big screen, they're supposed to kiss!"
c270_02_Lobby_Stay_1,I'll be practicing my swings.
c270_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Where are you, Pit Boss?
Your luck's gonna run dry if you keep hiding!"
c270_02_Outpost_Touch_1,Would building a baseball field in the Outpost be too unrealistic?
c270_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"Wow, it really hits me again just how massive the Outpost is.
I mean, we could totally play baseball here!"
c270_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Have you ever seriously considered setting up a batting cage?
I bet it'd be a big hit."
c270_02_Gacha_Get_1,The white rabbit who brings luck and victory is here!
c270_02_Reinforce_1,My batting average might go up now.
c270_02_Reinforce_2,I can feel the luck getting stronger and stronger.
c270_02_Reinforce_3,Luck charged!
c270_02_Gift_1,I wish every day were this infused with luck.
c270_02_Gift_2,"Oh, what's this? A gift coming right into my strike zone?
I love it!"
c270_02_Gift_3,"Foul ball!
Hehe, just kidding, Pit Boss. I'd never toss away a gift from you."
c270_02_Attractive_Up_1,You keep throwing me all these emotional fastballs.
c270_02_Attractive_Up_2,That's three outs already...
c270_02_Attractive_Up_3,That's it. I'm calling Noir over.
c270_02_Party_Deploy_1,"All right, I'm all warmed up."
c270_02_Field_Touch_1,"Which hand signal is it again... Oh, right. That one."
c270_02_Field_Go_1,Time to run the bases.
c270_02_Battle_Enter_1,I'm up at bat!
c270_02_Battle_Ready_1,Let's play ball!
c270_02_Battle_Ready_2,Let's play fairly!
c270_02_Battle_Ready_3,Batter up!
c270_02_Reload_1,Time! Time!
c270_02_Reload_2,I'm warming up!
c270_02_Reload_3,I'll tidy up the batter's box real quick!
c270_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Bases loaded! Time to settle this!
c270_02_Ult_Skill_1,I'm hitting a home run!
c270_02_FullBurst_1,Clear the bench!
c270_02_Kill_Monster_1,Out!
c270_02_Kill_Monster_2,Jackpot!
c270_02_Kill_Monster_3,We won!
c270_02_Damage_1,Ouch!
c270_02_Damage_2,Ah...!
c270_02_Damage_3,Argh...!
c270_02_Die_1,I'm sorry. I'll go back to the dugout.
c270_02_Win_1,We had to use the Mercy Rule.
c850_Lobby_Touch_1,"So, the Ark is humanity's final stronghold.
Sounds similar to the Colony where we're from."
c850_Lobby_Touch_2,"Fortunately, our weapons can take down Raptures, so we'll be able to help."
c850_Lobby_Touch_3,"There doesn't seem to be any obvious physical disparity between Nikkes and humans.
How do you tell them apart?"
c850_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Looks like we're both in very similar situations.
Let's stay strong and hang in there together."
c850_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,Why do I work as hard as I do? Perhaps because I believe it's the right thing to do.
c850_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,You don't always need a reason to help people.
c850_Lobby_Stay_1,"Wouldn't it be better to move, even a little, rather than just standing around like this?"
c850_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"The music here isn't too bad either. 
Take your time—I'll just be here enjoying it."
c850_Outpost_Touch_1,"So this is the Outpost.
May I take a look around?"
c850_Outpost_Touch_2,"This place is quite impressive.
I can't believe it's entirely underground."
c850_Outpost_Touch_3,"There's a waterfall underground? 
Incredible."
c850_Gacha_Get_1,"EVE from the Airborne Squad.
I will be joining you for a brief moment."
c850_Reinforce_1,"I can feel my strength surging through me.
What a familiar sensation."
c850_Reinforce_2,It's fascinating. Who knew I could be this strong.
c850_Reinforce_3,"I feel good.
It's making me want to move around."
c850_Gift_1,"Looks like a classified package, hidden under some kind of... camouflage?
But for camouflage... isn't this a bit too flashy?"
c850_Gift_2,"Thanks.
I will make sure to repay this kindness."
c850_Gift_3,"I don't have anything to give you in return,
so I will do my utmost to be of assistance."
c850_Attractive_Up_1,"You seem pretty used to strangers like us. 
Thank you for being so welcoming."
c850_Attractive_Up_2,"Being a Commander must be tough,
having to spin so many plates at once."
c850_Attractive_Up_3,"You all seem like good people.
I don't regret helping you one bit."
c850_Party_Deploy_1,I'm ready to fight anytime.
c850_Field_Touch_1,I'm here.
c850_Field_Go_1,I'll go over there.
c850_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy.
c850_Battle_Ready_1,Let's begin.
c850_Battle_Ready_2,I'll do my best.
c850_Battle_Ready_3,So these are the enemies of this world...
c850_Reload_1,Reloading.
c850_Reload_2,I'm out of ammo.
c850_Reload_3,"I'll join you soon, hang on."
c850_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Going in for close combat!
c850_Ult_Skill_1,Let's finish this in one fell swoop!
c850_FullBurst_1,This is it! Press the attack!
c850_Kill_Monster_1,Got them.
c850_Kill_Monster_2,I'll keep moving.
c850_Kill_Monster_3,Good.
c850_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c850_Damage_2,Ah...!
c850_Damage_3,Urgh...!
c850_Die_1,"I'm sorry, but I have to fall back!"
c850_Win_1,All clear. Where do we go next?
c851_Lobby_Touch_1,"This world is so similar to mine.
No wonder it makes me sick."
c851_Lobby_Touch_2,"Heh, rust buckets like these have humans on the ropes. How painfully pathetic."
c851_Lobby_Touch_3,I've stumbled into quite an irksome place.
c851_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Revenge does not discriminate.
It is the greatest equalizer."
c851_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I will kill EVE and prove myself to him again.
This is what I must do."
c851_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"I need to go back.
There is something I must do there."
c851_Lobby_Stay_1,"The air, the scenery...
Everything about this place gets on my nerves."
c851_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"What a desolate place, with no traces of life.
I like it."
c851_Outpost_Touch_1,"What is this place?
It's so noisy and bright. I hate it."
c851_Outpost_Touch_2,Hmmph. Just look at all these people prancing about.
c851_Outpost_Touch_3,I'm going back. I don't belong here.
c851_Gacha_Get_1,Everything I do is for him.
c851_Reinforce_1,Is this growth... How long has it been since I've felt something like this?
c851_Reinforce_2,"Hehe, yes, that's it. Give me more. More!"
c851_Reinforce_3,Oh... Can I become stronger?
c851_Gift_1,I don't need this.
c851_Gift_2,Get rid of this.
c851_Gift_3,What is this?
c851_Attractive_Up_1,Hmm...
c851_Attractive_Up_2,Bah. How useless.
c851_Attractive_Up_3,Ha. You can try and flatter me all you want. It's no use.
c851_Party_Deploy_1,I draw my sword only in service to him.
c851_Field_Touch_1,Don't touch me.
c851_Field_Go_1,"Don't order me around, or I'll kill you."
c851_Battle_Enter_1,Time to take out the garbage.
c851_Battle_Ready_1,I will crush them in an instant.
c851_Battle_Ready_2,How annoying. Begone.
c851_Battle_Ready_3,Let's see just how strong these things are.
c851_Reload_1,Talk about spoiling the mood.
c851_Reload_2,"Bah, just when things were getting good."
c851_Reload_3,Patience. I'll slash you soon enough.
c851_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Meet your doom!
c851_Ult_Skill_1,This is all for him!
c851_FullBurst_1,Die!
c851_Kill_Monster_1,Weak.
c851_Kill_Monster_2,Pathetic.
c851_Kill_Monster_3,Heh.
c851_Damage_1,Damn!
c851_Damage_2,Urgh!
c851_Damage_3,Well done...!
c851_Die_1,Has my blade been dulled?
c851_Win_1,How terribly unexciting.
c852_Lobby_Touch_1,"I can't believe I'm in another world!
I can experience all sorts of new things."
c852_Lobby_Touch_2,"Since this is a totally different world,
there must be all sorts of new technology as well."
c852_Lobby_Touch_3,"Leave all the mechanical stuff to me: maintenance, repairs, enhancements, you name it. I've got it all covered."
c852_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"The technology in this world isn't all that different from ours.
I knew it; technology progresses the same way, no matter what world you're in."
c852_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Mother, I know you're up there protecting us.
Keep us safe, and allow us to return safely."
c852_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"There are Raptures, the Ark and Nikkes.
Seems like this world is in big trouble as well. Hang in there, everyone."
c852_Lobby_Stay_1,I'm boooooored.
c852_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Take your time with your errands.
I'm gonna go look around and see if anything needs fixing."
c852_Outpost_Touch_1,"Whoa!
This whole place is underground?"
c852_Outpost_Touch_2,"There's actual ground, an artificial sky, and even an artificial waterfall!
I'd love to know how it was all made."
c852_Outpost_Touch_3,"And you said the Ark is way bigger than this place?
Wow! Now I'm really curious."
c852_Gacha_Get_1,"I am Lily Artemis II,
but just call me Lily."
c852_Reinforce_1,Wow... how does this work?
c852_Reinforce_2,"Could I learn more about this technology?
It's so tempting!"
c852_Reinforce_3,"I can't believe this.
I've gotten stronger without having to lift a finger."
c852_Gift_1,"Wow! What is this? 
How do you use it?"
c852_Gift_2,"Hehe. Thank you.
I'll make good use of it."
c852_Gift_3,"Um... if it's not too rude, could I disassemble this?"
c852_Attractive_Up_1,"I'm glad you're the ones I met here.
If I'd run into a bunch of villains, it would've been curtains for me."
c852_Attractive_Up_2,"I, Lily Artemis II, hereby offer my services to you all free of charge!"
c852_Attractive_Up_3,"I... I think that if we grow closer, it'll be more painful when we part ways."
c852_Party_Deploy_1,Huh? Me? But I'm not a member of the combat team...
c852_Field_Touch_1,Y-yes!
c852_Field_Go_1,Oh boy... I-I'll go...
c852_Battle_Enter_1,"Wh-whatever happens, happens!"
c852_Battle_Ready_1,Whew... Heading in!
c852_Battle_Ready_2,P-prepare yourself!
c852_Battle_Ready_3,"You've all got my back, right?"
c852_Reload_1,"To reload, you do... this!"
c852_Reload_2,Stay calm...
c852_Reload_3,Reloading!
c852_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'll go!
c852_Ult_Skill_1,This is my ultimate masterpiece!
c852_FullBurst_1,Now! Do it now!
c852_Kill_Monster_1,Oh?
c852_Kill_Monster_2,I got it!
c852_Kill_Monster_3,I-I did it!
c852_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c852_Damage_2,Ahhh...!
c852_Damage_3,Ouch...!
c852_Die_1,I-I told you! I'm not a member of the combat team!
c852_Win_1,"Maybe... just maybe...
I have a talent for combat."
c532_Lobby_Touch_1,"Let me know if there's anything you need! ♥
I'll be as accommodating as I can."
c532_Lobby_Touch_2,"Nothing can beat the joy of flying! ♥
It's the moment you're closest to the light."
c532_Lobby_Touch_3,"Trust is a precious thing! ★
Once it's lost, it can never be regained."
c532_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hehe, what should I bring from the surface today? ♥
Is there anything you'd like, Captain?"
c532_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Don't go telling anyone our secret, okay? 
If you do, my jealousy might come back and bite you! ★"
c532_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Oh no! Whatever shall I do?
You're just so magnificent, Captain! I wanna smuggle you straight to my room."
c532_Lobby_Stay_1,"Captain. Captain? Captain! Where did you go?
If you leave me alone any longer, I might go do something naughty."
c532_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hmm, what should I do while I'm waiting? ★
Maybe I'll smuggle in some of my goodies!"
c532_Outpost_Touch_1,"Wow, this place gets such great sunlight!
I want this place to myself! ★"
c532_Outpost_Touch_2,"This place is closer to the surface than the Ark, isn't it?
Hmm... does that mean I can do as I please here?"
c532_Outpost_Touch_3,"Let's see, where should I hide my stuff? ♥
Oh! ★ Were you listening?"
c532_Gacha_Get_1,"If I'm by your side, I'll get to see lots of cool stuff, won't I, Captain?
That sounds really fun! ★"
c532_Reinforce_1,Wow! ♥ I feel like I could fly!
c532_Reinforce_2,I'll try to serve you even better! ★
c532_Reinforce_3,"You're the best, Captain! ♥"
c532_Gift_1,"You're being so nice because you want something, right?
If you keep making my heart flutter like this, there's no telling what might happen next."
c532_Gift_2,"Oh wow, you did something for me? ★
I suppose I'll have to return the favor later."
c532_Gift_3,"Wow, I've been wanting this for a while!
Thank you! ♥"
c532_Attractive_Up_1,"What should I do? ♥ You keep being so nice to me!
It makes me want to give in to my greed and smuggle you away, Captain."
c532_Attractive_Up_2,"I lost something precious, and I think you've made off with it.
Mind if I frisk you? Teehee! ♥"
c532_Attractive_Up_3,"Now that we're this close,
how about we take things to the next level? ♥"
c532_Party_Deploy_1,Were you looking for me? ♥
c532_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Captain! ♥"
c532_Field_Go_1,Let's fly to the target area! ★
c532_Battle_Enter_1,"Obstacle, incoming! ♥"
c532_Battle_Ready_1,"All passengers, we're experiencing some turbulence! ★"
c532_Battle_Ready_2,Better keep my eyes peeled for anything enticing! ♥
c532_Battle_Ready_3,I wonder if there's anything valuable I can pick up?
c532_Reload_1,"Where did I put those mags... Oh, here they are!"
c532_Reload_2,It's taking longer than I thought. I'll try a bit harder! ♥
c532_Reload_3,"Darn, do I have to keep fighting? This stinks."
c532_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Captain! ♥
c532_Ult_Skill_1,"The stronger the light, the darker the shadow! Don't you think? ♥"
c532_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, we're clear for takeoff! ★"
c532_Kill_Monster_1,Awesome! Got some great loot! ★
c532_Kill_Monster_2,Nice shot! ★
c532_Kill_Monster_3,Annoying little creatures...
c532_Damage_1,Ouch! ♥
c532_Damage_2,That hurt.
c532_Damage_3,Ngh! ♥
c532_Die_1,Darn... Looks like I can't get that loot I wanted. Bummer! ♥
c532_Win_1,"Woohoo! Since we won, can I take a few souvenirs as a reward? ♥"
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"Living here isn't so bad.
The learning curve isn't too steep, and I think I'm adapting quite well."
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"If I ever get the chance, I'd like to visit this place you call the Ark.
I'm curious what it's like over there."
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"You say these Raptures are infinite in number?
... I see you suffer from that problem in this world as well."
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I'm starting to get used to this place. 
Maybe that's because it's not so different from our world?"
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"There are ten million people left in the Ark?
That is a large enough number to dream of hope."
c850_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"If the Raptures are infinite in number, then drastic measures must be taken to turn the tide."
c850_02_Lobby_Stay_1,Are you going to be away for long?
c850_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,Is it all right if I take a look around while I'm waiting?
c850_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"This place is very much its own self-contained miniature world.
While it may be diminutive, it has everything you need."
c850_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"Why are there no humans living here? 
... Ah, so Raptures attack this place on occasion."
c850_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"I don't mean to be a busybody, but you might want to consider fixing the elevator.
It rattles too much."
c850_02_Gacha_Get_1,"If you need me, call me anytime.
I want to repay you for all your help."
c850_02_Reinforce_1,"I'm overflowing with firepower.
I feel like I can do anything."
c850_02_Reinforce_2,I think it'll be possible to fight more efficiently.
c850_02_Reinforce_3,"I will be right back.
There is a move I want to try."
c850_02_Gift_1,"What clever camouflage... oh, wait, it's gift wrapping?
Hehe, well then, I'll be gentle when I open it. Thanks."
c850_02_Gift_2,"Do you need anything?
Is there anything I can help with?"
c850_02_Gift_3,"Is this how you use it...?
No... At any rate, I'll figure it out."
c850_02_Attractive_Up_1,Your squadmates are so full of energy. It's nice to see.
c850_02_Attractive_Up_2,"You're a good person, Commander.
Keep doing what you're doing."
c850_02_Attractive_Up_3,"If I had more time, I think your squad and ours would have made a great team."
c850_02_Party_Deploy_1,Roger. Heading in.
c850_02_Field_Touch_1,Where should I go?
c850_02_Field_Go_1,I'll take lead.
c850_02_Battle_Enter_1,"Let's go, everyone."
c850_02_Battle_Ready_1,We've got the drop on them.
c850_02_Battle_Ready_2,Position check. Let's go.
c850_02_Battle_Ready_3,This won't be a challenge.
c850_02_Reload_1,Cover me.
c850_02_Reload_2,Reloading.
c850_02_Reload_3,Pulling back for a moment.
c850_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,This is our chance!
c850_02_Ult_Skill_1,This is my territory!
c850_02_FullBurst_1,Let's keep the momentum going!
c850_02_Kill_Monster_1,I've got them.
c850_02_Kill_Monster_2,Target down. Next.
c850_02_Kill_Monster_3,Let's continue.
c850_02_Damage_1,Tsk!
c850_02_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c850_02_Damage_3,No way...!
c850_02_Die_1,The rest is up to you...
c850_02_Win_1,"Good teamwork, everyone. Let's keep it up."
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_1,This is the first time I've been able to relax like this.
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_2,"A bit of R&R is nice, but one must never forget their duty.
If there's anything you need, be sure to call me."
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_3,Hmm... Is it all right for me to be sitting around like this?
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Would you like to sit beside me? 
It's nice and cool over here."
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,So this is what it feels like to have time off. It's nice.
c850_03_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I might as well rest while I have the chance and worry about the rest later.
c850_03_Lobby_Stay_1,Where did you go? It's a bit awkward relaxing on my own.
c850_03_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"All right. Since I'm already here, I'll be patient and wait."
c850_03_Outpost_Touch_1,This place is quite well-made. It's a great place for walks.
c850_03_Outpost_Touch_2,I've never been to a place with such hustle and bustle. How fun!
c850_03_Outpost_Touch_3,"I wonder if there are any fish in the pool here... Probably not, right?"
c850_03_Gacha_Get_1,"I'm resting because I was told to...
But I wonder if I'm resting properly."
c850_03_Reinforce_1,"Even when I'm supposed to be resting, I must keep up my training."
c850_03_Reinforce_2,"I need to prepare for the big battle ahead.
Resting is part of that preparation."
c850_03_Reinforce_3,"All right, that should be enough.
I'm ready to set out anytime."
c850_03_Gift_1,"Thank you.
I'm sorry for always taking and never giving anything back."
c850_03_Gift_2,I will treasure this.
c850_03_Gift_3,"Let me know if there is something you want.
I will do my utmost to obtain it."
c850_03_Attractive_Up_1,Come and sit for a while before you go.
c850_03_Attractive_Up_2,"I never thought I would get to experience a world like this.
There is much to think about even after I return."
c850_03_Attractive_Up_3,Would you like something to drink?
c850_03_Party_Deploy_1,A battle? I'll get ready.
c850_03_Field_Touch_1,This is it.
c850_03_Field_Go_1,I think it's this way.
c850_03_Battle_Enter_1,Engaging the enemy.
c850_03_Battle_Ready_1,I need to loosen up. I'm a bit stiff.
c850_03_Battle_Ready_2,"Work hard, play hard."
c850_03_Battle_Ready_3,Time to resume my regular duties.
c850_03_Reload_1,I'll join you shortly.
c850_03_Reload_2,"Oh no, the bullets..."
c850_03_Reload_3,I've gotten a bit rusty.
c850_03_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Whew... I'm tired.
c850_03_Ult_Skill_1,Resting isn't so bad.
c850_03_FullBurst_1,Break time's over! Let's go!
c850_03_Kill_Monster_1,Good.
c850_03_Kill_Monster_2,Not bad.
c850_03_Kill_Monster_3,Target eliminated.
c850_03_Damage_1,Ah...!
c850_03_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c850_03_Damage_3,I let my guard down...!
c850_03_Die_1,... Looks like I relaxed too much. Sorry.
c850_03_Win_1,When can we rest again?
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_1,"I'm experiencing all sorts of new things.
I can't believe another world exists... heh."
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"These Raptures are everywhere you turn.
They're such a nuisance."
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"The Ark... humanity's last bastion.
It's somewhat amusing to watch everyone struggle so hard to survive."
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,Am I the only one who came?
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'm glad those irksome individuals didn't tag along.
It gives me one less thing to worry about."
c851_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,I must return to his side.
c851_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"This landscape is familiar, that's for sure.
Hehe, perhaps this world is worth exploring after all."
c851_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"The scent of wood and earth.
It's been so long."
c851_02_Outpost_Touch_1,This place makes me uncomfortable.
c851_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"A man-made underground paradise...
I don't like it."
c851_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"If I stay here any longer, I'm gonna end up breaking everything."
c851_02_Gacha_Get_1,"I must kill EVE.
I cannot allow such a pathetic being to stand beside him."
c851_02_Reinforce_1,"The greater the strength, the better."
c851_02_Reinforce_2,"Did I surpass another limit?
Heh. How fun!"
c851_02_Reinforce_3,"With this strength, EVE is mine!"
c851_02_Gift_1,I have no use for this.
c851_02_Gift_2,Quit giving me such pointless things.
c851_02_Gift_3,Take it back.
c851_02_Attractive_Up_1,Hmm...
c851_02_Attractive_Up_2,Stop lingering around me.
c851_02_Attractive_Up_3,... Don't come near me.
c851_02_Party_Deploy_1,Time to hunt.
c851_02_Field_Touch_1,What is this?
c851_02_Field_Go_1,I'll move when I want to. Leave me be.
c851_02_Battle_Enter_1,Let's start.
c851_02_Battle_Ready_1,The perfect time to kick back and relax.
c851_02_Battle_Ready_2,You're all nothing but heaps of scrap metal.
c851_02_Battle_Ready_3,Let me introduce you to death.
c851_02_Reload_1,Wait right there.
c851_02_Reload_2,Your life's extended for a few more seconds.
c851_02_Reload_3,Reloading.
c851_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Time to die.
c851_02_Ult_Skill_1,I will slice through all of you!
c851_02_FullBurst_1,Heh! Struggle all you want!
c851_02_Kill_Monster_1,Hindrance.
c851_02_Kill_Monster_2,Get lost.
c851_02_Kill_Monster_3,Hmph.
c851_02_Damage_1,Ugh...!
c851_02_Damage_2,What the...?!
c851_02_Damage_3,Agh...!
c851_02_Die_1,To face my downfall here... of all places!
c851_02_Win_1,I wasted my time. Moving on.
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_1,'Tis most awkward when thine eyes doth linger on me so.
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"This garb doth hinder not my movement in the least.
Most comfortable, forsooth."
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"This garb was wrought for dancing with blades.
A fine make, verily."
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Should I partake in spirits whilst garbed thus, I shall appear every bit the comely, modern young lass."
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I desire to show this unto Snow White and Rapunzel,
merely to behold the look upon their fair faces."
c222_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Were I to perambulate throughout the Ark thus, none would take heed of me."
c222_01_Lobby_Stay_1,Feel free to dawdle. I shall imbibe alone for the present.
c222_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,To imbibe alone doth not excite me. I shall await My Lord's arrival.
c222_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Let us make our way to the tavern in our current guise.
The experience shall be most unique, verily."
c222_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Take me to the waterfall.
I have long yearned to cleave through the waters."
c222_01_Outpost_Touch_3,Doth this not make me seem akin to a city maiden?
c222_01_Gacha_Get_1,"New spirits with a new unit... 
'Tis but a phrase I'm mulling over to commemorate these new outfits."
c222_01_Reinforce_1,"I feel the urge to move my body.
Wouldst thou join me?"
c222_01_Reinforce_2,"Each time mine skill doth improve, I feel a stir within me.
Perchance 'tis but simple ambition... or at least, I hope."
c222_01_Reinforce_3,"Fleetly Fading hath been sharpened yet further.
Now, wouldst thou fain behold who shall bear the brunt of this blade?"
c222_01_Gift_1,"Ah, thou dost present me with something most precious.
I shall accept it with gratitude, truly."
c222_01_Gift_2,I shall repay this favor with drinks anon.
c222_01_Gift_3,"I am most thankful. When time doth permit, I shall bring thee victuals aplenty."
c222_01_Attractive_Up_1,"If thou art at leisure, wouldst thou be inclined to join me for a tipple?"
c222_01_Attractive_Up_2,"My Lord, thou ought to show more restraint with thy smile."
c222_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Wouldst thou care to join me in rusticating?
I yearn to feel the wind upon my face."
c222_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Good fortune, 'tis. I was yearning for some movement."
c222_01_Field_Touch_1,There thou art.
c222_01_Field_Go_1,Excellent. Let us proceed forthwith.
c222_01_Battle_Enter_1,Let us go cleave them.
c222_01_Battle_Ready_1,I feel as though mine blade could cleave the very stars.
c222_01_Battle_Ready_2,Keep thy eyes wide open.
c222_01_Battle_Ready_3,The sword and mind must operate as one.
c222_01_Reload_1,It seemeth that thy blade hath dulled.
c222_01_Reload_2,"Wait but a tick, I shall finish anon."
c222_01_Reload_3,I shall rest for a brief spell.
c222_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Let us make haste.
c222_01_Ult_Skill_1,A clean division... or thereabouts.
c222_01_FullBurst_1,"Maidens, lend me thy strength."
c222_01_Kill_Monster_1,My blade cleft well.
c222_01_Kill_Monster_2,Begone.
c222_01_Kill_Monster_3,‘Tis been severed.
c222_01_Damage_1,Argh...!
c222_01_Damage_2,Ugh...!
c222_01_Damage_3,Egads!
c222_01_Die_1,"Mine excitement got the best of me, perchance. I beseech thee, handle the rest."
c222_01_Win_1,"Mine body feels light, and my blade doth dance."
c234_Lobby_Touch_1,"Why that look?
Does seeing me in this outfit surprise you?"
c234_Lobby_Touch_2,"I will opt out of swimming.
I cannot bear the idea of my clothes getting wet."
c234_Lobby_Touch_3,I sincerely hope I can find it here.
c234_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hehe, today is truly a joyous day, for I can be with you."
c234_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Come and join me, if you would.
I was just about to pour myself some tea."
c234_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"This is a parasol which I am rather fond of. 
What do you think of it?"
c234_Lobby_Stay_1,"The sunlight is quite intense here,
so I hope you won't keep me waiting for too long."
c234_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Enjoying some tea with a change of scenery isn't so bad, I suppose.
All the same, please do hurry back."
c234_Outpost_Touch_1,"The air is incredibly stuffy here. 
Let's leave quickly once you are finished."
c234_Outpost_Touch_2,There's a place here that sells parasols?
c234_Outpost_Touch_3,"Marigold... It's been a while.
Someone once roasted and brewed it for me a long time ago."
c234_Gacha_Get_1,"Somehow, I have an auspicious premonition that I might meet her today."
c234_Reinforce_1,That is a wise judgment. I will prove it by showing you the results.
c234_Reinforce_2,I shall ensure you do not regret placing your trust in me.
c234_Reinforce_3,"Are you still uneasy? 
Then I suppose I have no choice but to show you precisely what I'm capable of."
c234_Gift_1,Did I mention that I was fond of this?
c234_Gift_2,"Given your sincerity, I shall accept it gracefully."
c234_Gift_3,"If the opportunity arises, I shall repay you."
c234_Attractive_Up_1,"Your behavior is always a subject of fascination for me, Your Grace."
c234_Attractive_Up_2,"You are quite fortunate. 
I was just preparing some high-grade tea. Would you care for a taste?"
c234_Attractive_Up_3,"From here on out, I shall keep watch over you."
c234_Party_Deploy_1,"As it's a rare occasion, I shall take the lead."
c234_Field_Touch_1,You called?
c234_Field_Go_1,I shall proceed in that direction.
c234_Battle_Enter_1,Let's go.
c234_Battle_Ready_1,What is there to be concerned about when I am around?
c234_Battle_Ready_2,It has been quite some time since I felt such pleasant emotions.
c234_Battle_Ready_3,We will not be defeated by anyone now.
c234_Reload_1,One moment. I must reload.
c234_Reload_2,It is reassuring to have you by my side.
c234_Reload_3,I absolutely detest becoming unclean.
c234_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Are you suggesting we attempt this now?
c234_Ult_Skill_1,"Stop, it's cold... Heh, it's really cold!"
c234_FullBurst_1,Now! Push through to the very end!
c234_Kill_Monster_1,That was easy.
c234_Kill_Monster_2,Didn't I tell you not to worry?
c234_Kill_Monster_3,It has concluded.
c234_Damage_1,Agh!
c234_Damage_2,Tsk.
c234_Damage_3,Ugh!
c234_Die_1,I had hoped to spend a little more time together...
c234_Win_1,"Hehe, now we can finally get back to spending time together, just the two of us."
c502_Lobby_Touch_1,I can make sure you can enjoy BOOM out on the open seas.
c502_Lobby_Touch_2,Nothing beats chillin' on a floatie in the pool.
c502_Lobby_Touch_3,Is there anywhere near the sea where I can install BOOM?
c502_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"How's my swimsuit?
Isn't it BOOMtastic?"
c502_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Mr. Commander, wanna have a BOOMing good time? 
Guess what's on display? My swimsuit! Hehe."
c502_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You want to know more about my equipment?
Sure, let me give you a rundown!"
c502_Lobby_Stay_1,"I'm bored...
Swimming is exhausting..."
c502_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Take your time.
I'll just be here relaxing on my floatie."
c502_Outpost_Touch_1,"Next time we head out to sea, let's bring Ms. Trony with us."
c502_Outpost_Touch_2,"Installing BOOM at the outdoor pool? 
I already did that ages ago!"
c502_Outpost_Touch_3,"If a ghost appears, I'll take care of it with my handy BFG!"
c502_Gacha_Get_1,"BOOM anytime, anywhere!
Even out at sea!"
c502_Reinforce_1,"Upgrade complete! 
BFG is ready for action!"
c502_Reinforce_2,The suction power got even stronger!
c502_Reinforce_3,"Hehe, things just got even more electrifying."
c502_Gift_1,Oh! Thank you!
c502_Gift_2,This will let me enjoy BOOM a lot more!
c502_Gift_3,"Mr. Commander, you know me so well.
I've been needing this for a while."
c502_Attractive_Up_1,"I'm not afraid of ghosts or anything when I'm with you, Mr. Commander!"
c502_Attractive_Up_2,"Wanna float around the pool with me? 
It feels really great."
c502_Attractive_Up_3,"I think it'd be fun to play BOOM with this pad.
Wanna give it a go?"
c502_Party_Deploy_1,Let's start hunting some ghosts!
c502_Field_Touch_1,"All right, tell me where to go."
c502_Field_Go_1,Let's go this instant!
c502_Battle_Enter_1,"BFG, locked and loaded!"
c502_Battle_Ready_1,Let's make this electrifying!
c502_Battle_Ready_2,"I won't get electrocuted because of the water, will I?"
c502_Battle_Ready_3,"Ghosts or Raptures, bring it on!"
c502_Reload_1,Recharging battery!
c502_Reload_2,Don't worry! It's perfectly safe!
c502_Reload_3,This is fast charging? How slow...
c502_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Wiring installation complete!
c502_Ult_Skill_1,Connection complete! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
c502_FullBurst_1,"Berserk mode, activate!"
c502_Kill_Monster_1,BFG! BFG!
c502_Kill_Monster_2,Ghosts eliminated!
c502_Kill_Monster_3,That's how it's done!
c502_Damage_1,Eek!
c502_Damage_2,Ugh.
c502_Damage_3,"Ow, that hurt..."
c502_Die_1,"Uh oh, my battery's completely drained..."
c502_Win_1,"BFG! It's huge, it's cool, and it's a gun!"
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_1,Even if it's my first time at sea... there's always a way to survive!
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_2,"Stranded in the middle of the vast ocean...
Should I make some more survival tools?"
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_3,"Mmm, the intoxicating smell of the sea!
This would be an ideal place for summer survival training."
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Survivalist, wanna go play in the water later? 
I'll make sure you're completely safe!"
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you fall in the water, shout for me!
I... might not be able to rescue you myself, but I'll find the best way to help!"
c192_02_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"The sea is really dangerous, but as long as you can survive, it's a fantastic place.
I'll definitely come back with my squadmates next time."
c192_02_Lobby_Stay_1,"Survivalist...? You didn't leave me in the middle of the ocean on my own, did you?
No, you couldn't have... If you had, it'd be terrifying... It's not true, right?"
c192_02_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Hehe. I know you'd never abandon me, 
so even when I'm alone in the middle of the ocean, I'm not scared anymore."
c192_02_Outpost_Touch_1,"Wow, there's a pool at the Outpost too!
What were the pool survival rules again...?"
c192_02_Outpost_Touch_2,"It would be great if I could hang out at the pool with my squadmates.
I'll have to bring all of them here someday."
c192_02_Outpost_Touch_3,"Survivalist, you didn't forget to bring your survival tools before getting in the pool, did you?"
c192_02_Gacha_Get_1,"Looking for me?
Let's brave the open sea, and together, we'll survive!"
c192_02_Reinforce_1,"Oh, I feel like I can survive a bit longer!"
c192_02_Reinforce_2,"Even if waves came crashing down, I'd survive! ... I think?"
c192_02_Reinforce_3,"Oh, if my squadmates could only see me now!"
c192_02_Gift_1,"You're so thoughtful, Survivalist."
c192_02_Gift_2,"Thank you! 
With this, I'll be able to survive anywhere."
c192_02_Gift_3,"Oh, a gift!
Is there anything you need? I can try and make it for you!"
c192_02_Attractive_Up_1,"Um... Would you like to go for a walk on the beach later?
I-I'll be sure to protect you..."
c192_02_Attractive_Up_2,"No matter how many waves come crashing down, 
I will rescue you, promise!"
c192_02_Attractive_Up_3,"I will keep growing and become like my squadmates.
That way, I'll be able to rescue you anywhere, no matter how turbulent the sea."
c192_02_Party_Deploy_1,Okay! Which sea are we going to this time?
c192_02_Field_Touch_1,Preparation complete!
c192_02_Field_Go_1,The optimal route... I think that path will work.
c192_02_Battle_Enter_1,Gaaah! Emergency!
c192_02_Battle_Ready_1,I'm not scared of any waves... I hope.
c192_02_Battle_Ready_2,"Here I come, and I've got my sea legs now!"
c192_02_Battle_Ready_3,"Just trust me, Survivalist."
c192_02_Reload_1,I'm pretty sure they said this is how I'm supposed to reload it...
c192_02_Reload_2,Phew... Recharging my survival meter!
c192_02_Reload_3,"I won't let my guard down, not until we're all completely safe!"
c192_02_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Survivalist! I'm ready!
c192_02_Ult_Skill_1,Ignite! The fierce survival spirit of the blazing sea!!
c192_02_FullBurst_1,We will not let ourselves be submerged by the dangers of the sea!
c192_02_Kill_Monster_1,"Oh, it's done!"
c192_02_Kill_Monster_2,I'm alive!
c192_02_Kill_Monster_3,I did it!
c192_02_Damage_1,Agh!
c192_02_Damage_2,Ugh!
c192_02_Damage_3,Ouch...!
c192_02_Die_1,As expected... I still don't quite have what it takes to survive at sea...
c192_02_Win_1,Survivalist! We did it! We survived!
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"It appears you are unable to take your eyes off my swimsuit. 
I am glad it is to your liking."
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Commander, will you accompany me for a swim?"
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"The water temperature and breeze are perfect.
Maybe it's because you're here with me that everything feels truly complete."
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"It's still too soon for anything else,
but if you want, holding hands is fine."
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Allow me to apply the sunscreen for you.
It's... something I've always wanted to try."
c016_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Danger always seems to find us during the summer,
but there is no need for concern, Commander. I'll ensure you are well protected."
c016_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"Perhaps it is the heat,
but the wait feels unusually long today."
c016_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"There is no need for such unease. 
I will be here, waiting for you as I always do."
c016_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Since I'm wearing a swimsuit for once, I might as well go to the pool. Why don't you come with me, Commander? Just the two of us."
c016_01_Outpost_Touch_2,I hope Neon and Anis will be able to join us next time as well.
c016_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"What are you looking at, Commander?
... I don't mind. You can keep looking."
c016_01_Gacha_Get_1,"I got this swimsuit because I thought you'd like it.
What do you think, Commander?"
c016_01_Reinforce_1,"Yes, this is enough to make me stronger."
c016_01_Reinforce_2,"This feels good.
But I can still improve further."
c016_01_Reinforce_3,"I can't help but wonder how strong I can become when I'm with you, Commander."
c016_01_Gift_1,"Are you trying to make a move on me, Commander? All right, I'll let it slide."
c016_01_Gift_2,I can see where your tastes lie. I'll put this to good use.
c016_01_Gift_3,You know me better than I know myself. You even know exactly what I like.
c016_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Such a warm feeling... this must be because of you, Commander."
c016_01_Attractive_Up_2,I do not think the heat is the only reason my heart is racing.
c016_01_Attractive_Up_3,My devotion towards you will never waver.
c016_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Let's go, Commander."
c016_01_Field_Touch_1,What are your orders?
c016_01_Field_Go_1,Moving to the designated location.
c016_01_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c016_01_Battle_Ready_1,"Target confirmed, commencing operation."
c016_01_Battle_Ready_2,I shall suppress them swiftly.
c016_01_Battle_Ready_3,I will protect the Commander.
c016_01_Reload_1,Reloading.
c016_01_Reload_2,Aren't you staring a bit too intently?
c016_01_Reload_3,I will finish this quickly.
c016_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,I'm ready.
c016_01_Ult_Skill_1,"This way, Commander. There is no need to hesitate."
c016_01_FullBurst_1,"Up ahead, commence firing!"
c016_01_Kill_Monster_1,Neutralized.
c016_01_Kill_Monster_2,Target eliminated.
c016_01_Kill_Monster_3,Target down.
c016_01_Damage_1,Uh.
c016_01_Damage_2,Ugh.
c016_01_Damage_3,Ah!
c016_01_Die_1,"The perfect opportunity for us to be alone doesn't come around often.
It's truly regrettable."
c016_01_Win_1,"Commander. The disruptive elements have been removed. 
May we continue our date now?"
c093_Lobby_Touch_1,"If you're tired, drink this. It's a special remedy I whipped up to help with fatigue."
c093_Lobby_Touch_2,"I made a new blend of perfume. What do you think, Commander?"
c093_Lobby_Touch_3,"If you need anything, just let me know, okay?"
c093_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"I was thinking of you when I crafted this fragrance, Commander. If you like it, I can make more for you."
c093_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,This outfit contains a special solution. The texture is really something. Want to give it a feel?
c093_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You seem a bit worn out, Commander.
Here, lay your head on my lap. I've been studying a new kind of therapy."
c093_Lobby_Stay_1,"Commander? Oh my, I guess you fell asleep...
Hehe. You must have been running yourself ragged lately."
c093_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"You seem so busy lately...
I'll leave a scent diffuser in your room to help you sleep better."
c093_Outpost_Touch_1,"Have you noticed how Eunhwa's expression softens a little whenever you visit the Armory?
Hehe. Don't tell her I said that."
c093_Outpost_Touch_2,Looks like everyone has their hands full. Should I prepare some finger food that's easy to munch on?
c093_Outpost_Touch_3,"If you're bored, want to go shopping with me?
I just ran out of the ingredients I need to make perfume."
c093_Gacha_Get_1,"I'll be right by your side again, looking after you so you don't get worn out, Commander.
Hehehe. Take good care of me too, okay?"
c093_Reinforce_1,Now I can help you feel even more comfortable.
c093_Reinforce_2,Hehe. I bet I can get even stronger than this.
c093_Reinforce_3,I've got a better grasp of controlling the liquid solution now.
c093_Gift_1,"Hehe, thank you! I'll treasure it dearly."
c093_Gift_2,"You really are such a kind-hearted person, Commander."
c093_Gift_3,I'd love to give you a therapy session in return—do you have a minute?
c093_Attractive_Up_1,"Anytime you want to relax, you can always come to me."
c093_Attractive_Up_2,"Have you ever felt that fluttery feeling in your chest, Commander?
Whenever I'm with you, I get that exact feeling."
c093_Attractive_Up_3,"Vesti, Eunhwa, and you are all precious to me, Commander. But with you, it feels a little more special somehow."
c093_Party_Deploy_1,"If you need cover fire during battle, leave it to me."
c093_Field_Touch_1,Mmhm. I'm listening.
c093_Field_Go_1,Got it. Heading that way.
c093_Battle_Enter_1,Enemy spotted. Should we engage?
c093_Battle_Ready_1,"Well then, shall we face it together?"
c093_Battle_Ready_2,I'll make sure they don't move an inch.
c093_Battle_Ready_3,"All right everyone, let's relax and get started."
c093_Reload_1,Hang on just a sec.
c093_Reload_2,"Sorry, this is taking a while, isn't it?"
c093_Reload_3,I just need a short break to reload.
c093_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Liquid solution at the ready.
c093_Ult_Skill_1,Here you go! A little therapy for everyone.
c093_FullBurst_1,"C'mon, everyone, let's all attack together!"
c093_Kill_Monster_1,That was great. Hehe.
c093_Kill_Monster_2,It's done.
c093_Kill_Monster_3,Nothing to worry about.
c093_Damage_1,Ahh!
c093_Damage_2,Oh my!
c093_Damage_3,Eek!
c093_Die_1,"I'm sorry, Commander, I might have overdone it..."
c093_Win_1,"You did great, Commander. Did you like the new scent?"
c094_Lobby_Touch_1,"Is something wrong, Commander? I can listen, i-if you'd like!"
c094_Lobby_Touch_2,"Um, Commander... I-I get flustered when you look at me like that.
Could you look that way, instead?"
c094_Lobby_Touch_3,"Commander, you think I'm strong... right?"
c094_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"You can tell me anything. After all, you and I... are friends, aren't we?
Hehe. I said it. F-friends..."
c094_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Commander, my face feels really warm...
Do you know why that is...?"
c094_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"What's inside my shawl?
Here, I'll show you... b-but only you, Commander."
c094_Lobby_Stay_1,"... Y-you're not gonna leave me alone like this forever, are you?"
c094_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Kitty, when do you think the Commander will be back? I bet it won't be too long... But I really can't wait... Hehe."
c094_Outpost_Touch_1,Let's leave the Armory to Eu-Eunhwa and... hang out! Just the two of u-us... as friends!
c094_Outpost_Touch_2,"Emma said rest is important, so... why don't y-you and I rest together?"
c094_Outpost_Touch_3,"Where would you like to go, Commander?
I-I'm fine with anywhere, as long as it's with you."
c094_Gacha_Get_1,"If anyone tries to hurt you or our squad, I'll wipe them out with my missiles! So, please continue looking out for us..."
c094_Reinforce_1,I'll keep getting stronger...!
c094_Reinforce_2,"With this, I can kill even more."
c094_Reinforce_3,Those bullies can't do anything to me anymore!
c094_Gift_1,I-is this for me? R-really?
c094_Gift_2,"Th-thank you, Commander.
Hehe... I love it."
c094_Gift_3,I had something for you too... I'll be sure to br-bring it next time.
c094_Attractive_Up_1,"I'll try even harder to make you proud of me, Commander... because we're b-besties!"
c094_Attractive_Up_2,"I... I don't think ""friends"" is enough anymore. Wh-what comes after friends...?"
c094_Attractive_Up_3,"I-I want to stay with you f-forever, Commander. Always."
c094_Party_Deploy_1,O-okay! I'll do my best!
c094_Field_Touch_1,Um... Wh-what should I do...?
c094_Field_Go_1,Is this the r-right path?
c094_Battle_Enter_1,I'm ready to fight.
c094_Battle_Ready_1,Engaging the enemy now! Let's kill them all!
c094_Battle_Ready_2,Target sighted. Do I just crush them?
c094_Battle_Ready_3,I-I'll be right back!
c094_Reload_1,H-hold on! Reloading is taking longer than I thought...
c094_Reload_2,"G-get any closer, and you're all dead!"
c094_Reload_3,"C-can you cover me, please?"
c094_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Target locked.
c094_Ult_Skill_1,"Missile container online. Full barrage, fire!"
c094_FullBurst_1,G-good! Blow them all to pieces!
c094_Kill_Monster_1,"D-did you see that, Commander?"
c094_Kill_Monster_2,I-I did it!
c094_Kill_Monster_3,Hehe... They're all dead?
c094_Damage_1,Ah!
c094_Damage_2,Ugh!
c094_Damage_3,Ah!
c094_Die_1,"I-I'm sorry, C-Commander... I... I couldn't win..."
c094_Win_1,"As long as I'm with you, Commander... I-I think I can do even better!"
c095_Lobby_Touch_1,"Hey, Junior Blockhead. If you've got some free time, review the mission briefing."
c095_Lobby_Touch_2,"If you've got something to say, go ahead. I'll at least hear you out."
c095_Lobby_Touch_3,Don't start a conversation if you're not going to finish it. Don't leave people hanging.
c095_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Hey, Junior Blockhead. What's the next mission?"
c095_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"If you're curious about something, ask. I can at least offer some advice as your senior."
c095_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"We're Absolute. No matter how tough the mission is, just tell us what you need."
c095_Lobby_Stay_1,What are you doing? Now's not the time to be slacking off.
c095_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Running through the mission in your head? Take your time.
But it'd better be flawless."
c095_Outpost_Touch_1,"Not bad at all. Still, I think you could do even better."
c095_Outpost_Touch_2,Make sure to regularly maintain the weapons and ammo in the Armory so they're kept in perfect condition at all times.
c095_Outpost_Touch_3,"Always be thorough in mission prep. That's your job, after all."
c095_Gacha_Get_1,"Absolute is the ultimate force of perfection. Count yourself lucky to be on this journey with us, Junior Blockhead."
c095_Reinforce_1,I've gotten a bit more tactical.
c095_Reinforce_2,One step closer to ultimate strength.
c095_Reinforce_3,This is just the beginning. I'm far from satisfied.
c095_Gift_1,Looks like you've finally developed some good judgment.
c095_Gift_2,I hope it's something useful.
c095_Gift_3,You're giving this to me...? Thanks.
c095_Attractive_Up_1,I guess it's not completely foolish of me to entrust my dream to you.
c095_Attractive_Up_2,You're certainly not one of those run-of-the-mill weaklings.
c095_Attractive_Up_3,"If you're determined to walk that path, then I'll walk it with you. I'm counting on you, Junior Blockhead."
c095_Party_Deploy_1,That's some tactical thinking.
c095_Field_Touch_1,Call out the coordinates.
c095_Field_Go_1,Always stay alert and watch your surroundings while on the move.
c095_Battle_Enter_1,Encounter.
c095_Battle_Ready_1,I'll show you what perfection looks like.
c095_Battle_Ready_2,Target identified. Eliminating.
c095_Battle_Ready_3,I'll deal with this tactically.
c095_Reload_1,"Never take your eyes off the battlefield, even while reloading."
c095_Reload_2,Hang in there until I'm finished reloading.
c095_Reload_3,One second. I'll be back soon.
c095_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Target locked.
c095_Ult_Skill_1,"Once I've got something in my sights, I never miss."
c095_FullBurst_1,Go! Wipe them all out!
c095_Kill_Monster_1,Target neutralized.
c095_Kill_Monster_2,Next.
c095_Kill_Monster_3,Target eliminated.
c095_Damage_1,Ngh...
c095_Damage_2,Dammit!
c095_Damage_3,Damn.
c095_Die_1,I'm still a long way from being the perfect ultimate force it seems...
c095_Win_1,"Good work, Junior Blockhead. Not a bad operation."
c143_Lobby_Touch_1,"I only wore this because of the mission.
Don't get any weird ideas."
c143_Lobby_Touch_2,This is so awkward. I already said this doesn't suit me.
c143_Lobby_Touch_3,Ugh! I said stop calling me cute or I swear I'll smack you!
c143_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"... S-so, what do you think? Do you like it?
I didn't wear it because of you, but... I just w-wanted to know what you think."
c143_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"Well... I guess it's not so bad to dress up like this once in a while.
Especially since there's someone who seems to like it."
c143_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"You know what? You're...
Um... you're... r-really handsome, Pal."
c143_Lobby_Stay_1,"... Yeah, let me catch my breath for a sec.
Being around you looking like this... it's not good for my heart."
c143_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Pal, Pal! What're you up to? Are you busy?
... I-I'm not asking for your attention or anything. I'm just a little bored."
c143_Outpost_Touch_1,Uh... hold on. If Sugar and Frima see me like this...!
c143_Outpost_Touch_2,"Do you want to try on a bunny girl outfit too, Pal?
Haha, sorry, just the thought of it cracks me up."
c143_Outpost_Touch_3,"... Is it just me, or are there a lot of bunny girls everywhere?"
c143_Gacha_Get_1,"Well? What do you think of bunny girl Milk?
H-hey! Eyes up here, jerk!"
c143_Reinforce_1,How do I look? Do I seem stronger?
c143_Reinforce_2,"I don't think it's the bunny girl outfit that made me stronger. 
What do you think it was, Pal?"
c143_Reinforce_3,"As long as you're with me, Pal, I can keep getting stronger."
c143_Gift_1,"I feel like I'm always the one receiving from you. Thanks, Pal."
c143_Gift_2,What do you want in return? Just say the word.
c143_Gift_3,Hahaha. Don't tell me you like bunny girls that much you gave me a gift?
c143_Attractive_Up_1,"Do you like bunny girls, or do you like me? 
Although, I'm pretty sure I know the answer."
c143_Attractive_Up_2,"The more I get to know you, Pal, the more I like you."
c143_Attractive_Up_3,"I think I'm really fond of you, Pal."
c143_Party_Deploy_1,"Do you seriously want me to go out like this? Er, Pal...?"
c143_Field_Touch_1,"You've got some weird taste, Pal...
Whatever, it's no big deal. Let's go."
c143_Field_Go_1,"Are you seriously asking if I'm okay in these high heels?
What do you take me fo—eek?!"
c143_Battle_Enter_1,Just wipe that memory you have of me tripping.
c143_Battle_Ready_1,Ever been punched by a bunny girl?!
c143_Battle_Ready_2,Bunnies are actually carnivores!
c143_Battle_Ready_3,This restrictive outfit isn't a problem at all!
c143_Reload_1,"Ow, my feet hurt..."
c143_Reload_2,This thing is tighter than I thought...
c143_Reload_3,"The outfit isn't ruined, is it?"
c143_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,Pal! I'm ready!
c143_Ult_Skill_1,Hey. Q-quit looking at me like that!
c143_FullBurst_1,Die! Die! Die!
c143_Kill_Monster_1,Hahaha! Next!
c143_Kill_Monster_2,"I'm the killer bunny, punk!"
c143_Kill_Monster_3,One down!
c143_Damage_1,Eek!
c143_Damage_2,Ow!
c143_Damage_3,Geez!
c143_Die_1,I-it's your fault for staring at me like that...
c143_Win_1,Hahaha! Fighting in this outfit is actually kind of fun!
c315_Lobby_Touch_1,"Welcome, Master.
I'll be serving you today as a bunny girl."
c315_Lobby_Touch_2,"... I-is there anything you need?
I-It's just... if you stare at me like that..."
c315_Lobby_Touch_3,"Hehe, I even received special agent training this time.
I hope I get a chance to show it off to you."
c315_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,P-perhaps... you prefer bunny girls over maids?
c315_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I-it's not so much that I'm embarrassed...
It's just that showing this side of me to you is kind of..."
c315_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"P-please stop staring at me...!
Ahhh..."
c315_Lobby_Stay_1,"So embarrassing, so embarrassing, so embarrassing..."
c315_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"Master still says I'm beautiful even when I look like this... 
... Hehe. I really like you, Master."
c315_Outpost_Touch_1,M-master?! What are you doing here?!
c315_Outpost_Touch_2,"I won't run into Master... right?
It'd be too embarrassing if he saw me dressed like this..."
c315_Outpost_Touch_3,Hehe. Hosting a bunny girl event at the Maid Cafe would be fun.
c315_Gacha_Get_1,"Are you well, Master?
Hehe. I may be dressed differently than usual, but I'll still do my best to serve you."
c315_Reinforce_1,"I-I did get stronger, but..."
c315_Reinforce_2,I will r-repay you with b-better... s-service...
c315_Reinforce_3,M-master... Stop...
c315_Gift_1,I n-need to... I need to give something in return...!
c315_Gift_2,Th-th-thank you!
c315_Gift_3,"I-I'm really sorry, but could I maybe accept it later...?"
c315_Attractive_Up_1,You don't hate how I'm dressed... do you...?
c315_Attractive_Up_2,"Y-you're such a tease, Master. But even so... I'm really happy."
c315_Attractive_Up_3,"As long as you like it, it doesn't matter how I'm dressed."
c315_Party_Deploy_1,"Whew... Yeah, I'm okay now.
I'll get it done perfectly."
c315_Field_Touch_1,"Yes, Master. I'm listening."
c315_Field_Go_1,I'll proceed swiftly and silently.
c315_Battle_Enter_1,Commencing mission.
c315_Battle_Ready_1,"I feel a bit self-conscious with Master watching, but...!"
c315_Battle_Ready_2,"I will fight not as a maid, but as an agent!"
c315_Battle_Ready_3,"Watch me, Master... Er... I mean, just for a bit."
c315_Reload_1,I almost made e-eye contact with Master...!
c315_Reload_2,"Oh, jeez... I'm getting embarrassed again."
c315_Reload_3,"Gotta stay calm, like a true agent...!"
c315_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Master."
c315_Ult_Skill_1,Let me show you the results of my training...!
c315_FullBurst_1,"Everyone, now!"
c315_Kill_Monster_1,Done and dusted!
c315_Kill_Monster_2,It needs to be even more perfect...!
c315_Kill_Monster_3,It needs to be more flawless...!
c315_Damage_1,Ah!
c315_Damage_2,Ungh...
c315_Damage_3,Ugh.
c315_Die_1,It seems... I still lack training...
c315_Win_1,"Mission complete, Master."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"... I'm fine.
It's a lucky... outfit after all."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"Even if I'm not quite like Blanc or Noir,
if I can bring even just a tiny bit of luck to others..."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"You can't focus on the game?
Wh-what do you mean..."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"If you're looking at me like that... it means you like it, right?
... Hehe, I'm glad I wore this lucky outfit. It's totally worth it."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"I'll be your personal lucky bunny, Highroller."
c272_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Focus on the game for now, please.
If you want to look... you can stare all you want later."
c272_01_Lobby_Stay_1,"... There's so much to fuss about with this outfit.
Y-you didn't see anything, did you...?"
c272_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"... I guess you're busy.
I'll just quietly stay by your side and recharge your luck."
c272_01_Outpost_Touch_1,Was it really a good idea to come out dressed like this for publicity...?
c272_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Oh, Highroller. 
I'm so glad you're here. I was really nervous being alone."
c272_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"B-be sure to... join C-Coin Rush's latest event...
*Sigh* I should go get changed..."
c272_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Hello, Highroller. Which game are you inter—
Don’t mind my clothes. It’s just my lucky outfit."
c272_01_Reinforce_1,Hehe. Is it possible to get even luckier?
c272_01_Reinforce_2,"I'll use all this luck on you, Highroller."
c272_01_Reinforce_3,"Why don't we test how much stronger I've gotten?
How about a game?"
c272_01_Gift_1,"Thank you, as always."
c272_01_Gift_2,"Thank you for the luck you've given me, Highroller."
c272_01_Gift_3,I'll repay you with even greater luck.
c272_01_Attractive_Up_1,Will you be my good luck charm?
c272_01_Attractive_Up_2,"Meeting you might just be my greatest stroke of luck, Highroller."
c272_01_Attractive_Up_3,"A relationship where we exchange luck.
... Yeah. I'm really glad we have that kind of bond."
c272_01_Party_Deploy_1,"Stay tuned. Your lucky bunny is about to shine, Highroller."
c272_01_Field_Touch_1,"With an outfit like this, I should be careful..."
c272_01_Field_Go_1,"... I-I'll go a little slower.
If I'm not careful... things might slip off..."
c272_01_Battle_Enter_1,"It's a little embarrassing, but I'm sure with this outfit, luck will follow."
c272_01_Battle_Ready_1,Your lucky bunny will fight alongside you.
c272_01_Battle_Ready_2,I better be careful not to ruin this outfit.
c272_01_Battle_Ready_3,C-could you please look away for a moment?
c272_01_Reload_1,Eek! The stickers almost fell off...!
c272_01_Reload_2,Highroller wasn't watching... was he?
c272_01_Reload_3,I need to cover up a little...
c272_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I'm ready, Highroller."
c272_01_Ult_Skill_1,Shall I put my luck to the test?
c272_01_FullBurst_1,"Should I recommend this outfit to the others, too?"
c272_01_Kill_Monster_1,Victory to the bunny.
c272_01_Kill_Monster_2,I won't have any bad luck in this outfit.
c272_01_Kill_Monster_3,Easy enough.
c272_01_Damage_1,Ugh.
c272_01_Damage_2,My outfit...!
c272_01_Damage_3,Eek...
c272_01_Die_1,Not again... This jinx...
c272_01_Win_1,"That was lucky. But...
It was more embarrassing than I thought..."
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_1,"... What are you looking at?
N-never seen a bunny girl before?"
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_2,"I can tell people are looking at me differently today.
... So stay by my side, please."
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_3,"I chose something similar to my cheerleading uniform.
... What do you think, Coach? Does it look okay?"
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_1,"Y-you can only look at my eyes.
Anywhere else... maybe just a quick peek."
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_2,"This is basically what I usually wear.
Just because it's a bunny girl costume, people are looking at me differently...? How strange."
c550_01_Lobby_Touch_Love_3,"Of course I can still cheer now.
I have a special choreography to match this outfit... Want me to show you?"
c550_01_Lobby_Stay_1,... So you're completely ignoring me just because I told you not to look?
c550_01_Lobby_Stay_Love_1,"I'm not saying this just because I'm a bunny girl right now...
But I wish you'd pay a little more attention to me."
c550_01_Outpost_Touch_1,"Oh, yeah. Want to take a look around together, Coach?"
c550_01_Outpost_Touch_2,"Bunny girl and cheerleading... Hm, that might not be so bad."
c550_01_Outpost_Touch_3,"What would be a good cheer... Bunny bunny? Bounce?
C-Coach?! How long have you been standing there?!"
c550_01_Gacha_Get_1,"Hi, Coach. I-I'd appreciate it if you didn't stare at me like that."
c550_01_Reinforce_1,Maybe I'll feel a little less embarrassed now?
c550_01_Reinforce_2,"I've gotten used to Coach's gaze, so I'll get used to everyone else's too."
c550_01_Reinforce_3,I think I've got the perfect cheer for this outfit.
c550_01_Gift_1,"C-could you not stare like that? 
Just... don't look. Not right now."
c550_01_Gift_2,Are you only being nice to me because I'm dressed like this?
c550_01_Gift_3,... Thanks. I'm really happy.
c550_01_Attractive_Up_1,"Is there... anything you would like me to do? 
It's not often I'm in this kind of outfit after all..."
c550_01_Attractive_Up_2,"You don't like the bunny girl outfit more than me, do you?"
c550_01_Attractive_Up_3,"Does seeing me in this outfit make your heart race too, Coach?"
c550_01_Party_Deploy_1,... Coach. I think it's a bit too soon to go out dressed like this.
c550_01_Field_Touch_1,I-it's embarrassing... being seen like this by everyone.
c550_01_Field_Go_1,"Honestly... you're such a perv, Coach."
c550_01_Battle_Enter_1,"... Okay. I'll try my best.
That way, the others will do their best too."
c550_01_Battle_Ready_1,Bunny Go! Bunny Go!
c550_01_Battle_Ready_2,"With the energy of a bunny —
No, I don't think that's it."
c550_01_Battle_Ready_3,You really shouldn't be staring that much.
c550_01_Reload_1,Th-the hem of this outfit...!
c550_01_Reload_2,"I-I can sense your gaze on me, Coach."
c550_01_Reload_3,N-not right now. Don't look.
c550_01_Ult_Skill_Ready_1,"I-I still need to do my job, even if I'm embarrassed."
c550_01_Ult_Skill_1,"Everyone, shine brightly!"
c550_01_FullBurst_1,Let's hype it up and take it to the end!
c550_01_Kill_Monster_1,Wh-when will this end?
c550_01_Kill_Monster_2,It's not over yet...?!
c550_01_Kill_Monster_3,Everyone. Let's finish it q-quickly.
c550_01_Damage_1,Aah!
c550_01_Damage_2,Ungh...
c550_01_Damage_3,Ouch...!
c550_01_Die_1,I need to push a little harder...
c550_01_Win_1,"Now that the fight's over, I'm starting to feel self-conscious. How'd I do...?"
