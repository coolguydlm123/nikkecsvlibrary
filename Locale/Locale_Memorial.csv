memorial_01_name,A Man's Memoir
memorial_01_description,The memoirs of a man sequestered inside the bunker.
memorial_01_01_name,"February 7, XX."
memorial_01_01_description,"It's been four months since I entered this bunker.
There's only canned food, but at least there's enough to go around. There's a stable power supply as well.
I know the army will come to my rescue. All I have to do is wait.
They'll exterminate all those insect-like machines we call Raptures and take me away from this place.
Until that day comes, I have to hold on."
memorial_01_02_name,"August 21, XX."
memorial_01_02_description,"No one has come to my rescue.
Has the army been defeated?
That can't be. The TV said we were winning the war against the Raptures.
They just haven't found me yet.
I have to try to make the SOS signal stronger.
I'm a bit worried about the power, but help will be here soon enough. Everything will work out in the end."
memorial_01_03_name,"December 5, XX."
memorial_01_03_description,"Used up the last of the rations.
Plenty of power remaining, but electricity doesn't put food in my stomach.
It's time for me to go outside.
I wonder, have I been afraid of nothing this entire time?
All right, I'll go outside.
Perhaps people will interview me when they see me.
They'll tell me the war has been over for some time now, and I'll look like a right fool for staying in this bunker for as long as I have. 
I'm setting out tomorrow at sunrise.
I haven't seen another human being for ages. My stomach is already in knots."
memorial_02_name,Survival Guide 01
memorial_02_description,A guide to surviving on the surface. Author unknown.
memorial_02_01_name,1. How To Avoid Raptures
memorial_02_01_description,"Don't make any loud noises.
When conversing with others, keep your voice as low as possible.
Watch your footsteps and tread lightly.
Shooting is a guaranteed way of exposing yourself.
In other words, it's better to ignore armed marauders.
If you fire your gun, the first bullet that is ejected will seal your fate."
memorial_02_02_name,2. How to Secure Food
memorial_02_02_description,"Throw away everything but canned food.
Avoid areas nearby ponds.
If you want to go anywhere, don't move an inch until it's been 10 minutes since you last heard Rapture gunshots."
memorial_02_03_name,3. How To Sleep
memorial_02_03_description,"Never lie down unless you're in an enclosed space.
If at all possible, sleep with your body tied up.
This way, you won't move during sleep.
If someone you're with has a habit of talking in their sleep, snuggling up to them is the last thing you want to do. Keep your distance.
That way, your partner may be a goner, but at least you'll have a chance of surviving the night."
memorial_02_04_name,4. How To Deal With Strangers
memorial_02_04_description,"Trying to intimidate them with a weapon is useless.
If anything, it'll only be counterproductive if the people you're up against know about Tip No.1.
After you've gotten what you want out of them, go after their legs.
Raptures will only move on to the next location after clearing the other. This will buy you some time."

memorial_04_01_description,I heard Henry downstairs has won the Ark Lottery. Unbelievable. That freeloader hasn't had a decent job his whole life. Some upstanding citizen he would make! Surely there's been a mistake.
memorial_04_02_name,2
memorial_04_02_description,"I checked, and the data is correct. Why not me? I asked them why Henry was the one who won, but they told me it was classified. Now I'm positive. Henry bribed someone at the lottery offices somehow. Becoming an Ark citizen is the greatest glory one can hope to achieve. Does he really think he can buy his way in there? Well, he better think again."
memorial_04_03_name,3
memorial_04_03_description,"I went to see Henry.
I told him it was a waste letting someone like him inside the Ark, and that he should give the lottery ticket to me.
Henry flashed that stupid grin that he's always got plastered on his face and said,
""Sorry, no can do.""
Damn him.
An ingrate like him doesn't deserve to go to the Ark."
memorial_04_04_name,4
memorial_04_04_description,"I got it.
The ticket had some stains, but I managed to get all the red out.
Now I can become a true Ark citizen.

and contribute towards mankind.
All for humanity."

I thereby insist a thorough investigation be conducted on the Big Three and their research institutes."

I just happened to live near the elevator and saw the alien with my own eyes.
First off, it looks more machine-like than any sort of chimera-ish creature we had been imagining.
See the photo attached above.

- Pretty solid photoshop skills, impressive! ^^
- It's way too detailed. There's no way that's real.
- I'm back from the future to pay respect to this amazing post. It's a shame no one bought it at the time."

memorial_11_02_description,"I'm the person who uploaded a photo and claimed to have seen an alien before.
At that time, I only saw an alien as large as a small vehicle. But this time, it is totally different.
It's as large as a small villa, and shooting at the alien with a cartridge leaves no traces.
But then again, the alien shoots a laser from a core-like spot, and the laser punctures a heavily armored vehicle immediately.

- Though it might be fake, it's still funny. Haha. Hope there will be the next update tomorrow. Hahaha.
- The surface seems to be bulletproof. I'm curious about its composition.
   -> Adamantium.
   -> Gundarium Alloy.

I think the best way is to set off a nuclear bomb—mutually assured destruction.

- Yep. My thoughts exactly. Not even a surface-to-air missile could penetrate the Rapture's hide, let alone bullets.
- Let's enjoy the time we have left!
- Haven't foreign countries tried nuclear bombs before? I heard they were useless.

However, the other doctors and nurses have long since gone missing.

By staying in one place, we've managed to avoid attracting the aliens' attention.
But the medicine and disinfectants are running low. I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out.
The number of patients continues to rise,
yet there is no sign of a decrease in the number of aliens outside.
I feel like this is all a nightmare I want to wake up from..."

It reads, ""I would rather go to the Ark than stay here. By being here, I feel
like I'm traipsing about a dark tunnel with no light at the end.""
To be frank, I agree with her, but I mustn't give up. Not yet.
Until peace is restored to our world, I intend to stay right here and continue treating patients. No matter how long it takes. I'm sure that day will come."

At a glance, scalpels and dead patients surround me.
Slowly, my mind wanders into the abyss. I was supposed to save these people.

memorial_18_02_description,"I made a speech in front of the local politicians today.
When I mentioned the dramatic rise in temperature,
ice calving, and ice field reduction,
one man raised his hand and had the gall to say,
""Sounds great to me! I prefer warmer weather.""
It took all my willpower not to grab him by the collar and throttle him.
What fools they are! They won't enjoy the warm weather when the ocean rises to their necks!"
memorial_18_03_name,"June 27, XX."
memorial_18_03_description,"I've gone over it countless times, but I still feel that climate change is a man-made disaster.
If there were fewer humans, there would be lesser greenhouse gas emissions.
If there were fewer humans, there would be lower rates of deforestation.
In that sense, the birth rate reductions in several countries would actually be a positive sign.
The same goes for these aliens that have been such breaking news lately.
Perhaps it may not be a bad thing if the world population is reduced."

It was merely whether or not humans could survive in it."

This turned out to be a terrible miscalculation.
The sight of their comrades giving their lives away proved to be too traumatic for two of the surviving Nikkes, and they underwent a Mind Switch. The other two Nikkes shot and killed them, but that made their own mental condition unstable as well."

Again, this particular model looks entirely different from other pre-existing ones.
This decidedly non-academic language is hardly suitable for a report, but it looks a bit rough around the edges.
Its diminutive size also makes it appear quite feeble.
For some reason I can't explain, its gaze appeared to be fixated in this direction.
Something's off. I'm going to pull back for the time being."

memorial_33_01_description,"I was sent on a special Rapture investigation mission as the head of the squad.
We've got a bit of a reputation as a suicide squad, especially when it comes to figuring out what kind of abilities these Raptures might have.
Still, these missions pay well.
It's been a while since I've wired money back home, so I've got a lot riding on this."
memorial_33_02_name,March 18
memorial_33_02_description,"We encountered a special Rapture, a Master-level one. After a brief skirmish, we secured victory easily enough.
It exhibited no apparent special abilities and moved much slower than those I've encountered previously.
One unique aspect was the luminescent crystals that were embedded in its body.
I heard that on rare occasions, some Raptures have expensive ores attached to them, so I decided to collect those crystals.
If their color and luster are any indication, they must be worth a fortune."
memorial_33_03_name,March 21
memorial_33_03_description,"One of the Nikkes who went on the mission suddenly expired.
Just dropped dead.
No noticeable wounds on her body. No traces of corruption.
It was like she just switched off.
After the other Nikkes and I mourned her properly,
I picked up the crystal that she had been holding.
There was this loud crunching sound, which in and of itself wasn't so unusual, but it somehow felt as if I had torn off a part of her.
She had clung unto it like grim death, and I was actually quite touched by her dedication.
I don't know if it was my imagination, but the crystal seemed to grow larger in that moment."

memorial_33_04_description,"Another Nikke died suddenly.
There we were, walking, and she just collapsed.
I heard a tinkling sound when she fell.
Not a bang or plop, but a distinct tinkling.
I thought it was because the crystal had dropped to the ground when she fell, but she had fallen backward and was still holding onto it firmly.
The last Nikke alive in the squad said she had heard the same sound as well.
After mourning her passing, we decided to conduct an autopsy.
Inside, her body was full of crystals."
memorial_33_05_name,Crack Crack
memorial_33_05_description,"The Nikke and I were stunned by what we saw.
Suddenly, we heard the sound of glass shattering.
The deceased Nikke bolted upright and looked at us with dead, hollow eyes.
We fled at once.
I immediately requested an extended leave, while the other Nikke asked for her memory to be erased.
What on earth happened back there?
It must have been because of those cursed crystals.
The sound of that glass breaking haunts my dreams to this day."

memorial_oldtales_01_01_name,Corruption Report I
memorial_oldtales_01_01_description,"This report concerns my observations thus far on the phenomenon called ""Corruption"".
Corruption is a technological invention from the Raptures which induces temporary paralysis in a Nikke's nervous system. There is currently no known method to counteract this process, but since the effects are mild, the risk level can be considered low.
It has also been confirmed to be non-contagious.
However, being rendered immobile even for a brief moment can be fatal on the battlefield, so caution is advised."
memorial_oldtales_01_02_name,Corruption Report II
memorial_oldtales_01_02_description,"The Rapture that causes Corruption utilizes a specialized tentacle-shaped apparatus.
The tentacles physically penetrate the Nikke's body, inducing Corruption.
The duration of the resulting paralysis varies depending on each Nikke, but the specifics have not yet been identified.
Additional tracking and observation will be necessary."
memorial_oldtales_01_03_name,Corruption Report III
memorial_oldtales_01_03_description,"Although we performed an autopsy on a Nikke in a state of Corruption, no significant abnormalities were found.
There were only external wounds from the tentacles, and no unusual substances were found internally.
We therefore presume this to be the work of some kind of microorganism or virus.
As Nikkes are mechanical in nature, it is recommended to narrow the scope of inquiry to only viral strains for further investigation."
memorial_oldtales_01_04_name,Corruption Report IV
memorial_oldtales_01_04_description,"It has been confirmed that Corruption forcibly issues a command to NIMPH.
What we are seeing is not paralysis, but rather a command to cease all actions. A killswitch.
There also appears to be a partial connection to verbal commands.
While it may be possible to implant other types of override commands,
at this point in time, we have not seen any cases exhibiting anything other than the disruption of physical actions.
Further tracking for additional cases is necessary."
memorial_oldtales_01_05_name,Corruption Report VI
memorial_oldtales_01_05_description,"So far, the only cases discovered are related to the ceasing of physical commands.
Numerous antidotes and vaccine programs have been attempted to treat the Corruption, but none have proven effective.
Fortunately, thanks to NIMPH's natural defense capabilities, the invasive bodies cease their activity within a short period.
Since there are still many things about NIMPH itself which remain unclear, proactive treatment is currently impossible.
Until we know more about NIMPH, any research on the treatment of Corruption will be temporarily halted."

memorial_oldtales_02_03_name,Corruption Report III - Unofficial
memorial_oldtales_02_03_description,"Corruption is coded in a way that humans can understand.
This means that you can embed the command you desire within the Corruption's code and make the Nikke carry it out.
After injecting Corruption with a command impelling Test Subject 13 to constantly shout ahead, she followed the command faithfully for the proceeding three minutes.
She then returned to her senses, and the subsequent autopsy confirmed that no traces of Corruption remained thanks to NIMPH's natural healing properties.
These aforementioned healing abilities are proving rather troublesome. I want to extend the duration of the commands being input, but I lack sufficient knowledge of NIMPH.
For now, I need to determine how far I can push it."
memorial_oldtales_02_04_name,Corruption Report IV - Unofficial
memorial_oldtales_02_04_description,"Any action embedded within the Corruption functions as an overriding command, without exception.
For Test Subject 49, Corruption with the command to induce self-harm was injected, which the subject executed precisely as ordered.
Any and all commands in the code assume absolute authority over all else.  Corruption transforms the NIMPH itself, which Nikkes are incapable of resisting.
You can essentially make them do anything. However, the short duration of Corruption remains a sore spot."

I injected the Corruption containing my personality data into Test Subject 134, and something incredible happened.
Several unique behavioral patterns appeared. Not only did the subject attempt to protect the Rapture, she also became hostile toward Nikkes.
The subject acquired the mindset of a Rapture. 
Interestingly, the Rapture did not view the Nikke which had received the Corruption as an adversary.
The path to unity has been revealed.
However, Test Subject 134 ended her own life as soon as the Corruption lifted.

memorial_oldtales_03_01_description,"I've tinkered with the personality data countless times, and subjected numerous test subjects to various environmental conditions, but have yet to achieve any real breakthrough.
After the Corruption lifted on Test Subject 251, she cried and shouted incessantly before attempting to flee. I had to dispose of her.
However, watching her flee brought me to a sudden realization.
The Rapture had found a way to touch the NIMPH without any encouragement on my part.
If I just give them a little push, a great leap forward is inevitable.
I captured 10 Raptures, implanted the Corruption with my personality data, and then released them."
memorial_oldtales_03_02_name,Corruption Report VII - Unofficial
memorial_oldtales_03_02_description,"More wonderful news.
Reports of strengthened Corruption are flooding in.
The duration has been greatly extended, and the time required to manifest has been significantly shortened.
Behavior patterns have become much more diverse. The Nikkes are now truly living for the Raptures.
What magnificent creatures the Raptures are. Awe-inspiring, even.
Though there are reports that affected Nikkes repeat the last thing they did or said due to resistance from the NIMPH,
in the end, they are completely subsumed by the Corruption.
The path to unity is within reach. I must keep moving forward."
memorial_oldtales_03_03_name,Corruption Report VIII - Unofficial
memorial_oldtales_03_03_description,"It has been some time since I left a report.
The Corruption has evolved to near-perfection, but there is still one last step remaining.
I must confirm what happens when a Grimms Model is infected with Corruption.
If my hypothesis is correct, the Rapture will not consume the Grimms Model as a disposable asset. Such a powerful Nikke would be considered valuable even to the Rapture.
I'm so excited that I can hardly sleep.
What will happen? What will happen?
What will become of Cinderella?"

You've been chosen by the Raptures, or more specifically, by their Queen.
Not just anyone can become a Heretic.
Only Nikkes selected by the Queen can be reborn as Heretics.
By unfastening their personalities and replacing them with my own advanced personality data,
I carefully guide Nikkes along the path to becoming Heretics.
Not every Nikke receives this honor.
So, Cinderella, take pride in yourself.
And always remember:
You were at your most beautiful when you were Anachiro."

memorial_42_01_description,"Is this thing recording? Okay, yeah, it is. 
Since you guys never read what I wrote, I decided to leave a voice message instead. 
So make sure to listen. I'll really quiz you on this later, got it?
*Sigh*… Who am I kidding? None of you will probably listen to this. Still, it doesn't hurt to try."
memorial_42_02_name,02.wav
memorial_42_02_description,"This should be obvious by now, but the egg must not be subjected to any strong impacts. 
Given that its contents aren't fully developed yet, it's exceedingly fragile. That means no touching it or horseplaying around it.
Once it's ready, it will hatch of its own accord, so just leave it alone until then.
You get that? Don't mess with it in any way. Don't feed it. Don't sing to it. Don't even speak to it, even if it's something nice.
Just leave it be. I'm begging you."
memorial_42_03_name,03.wav
memorial_42_03_description,"Remember that silver liquid I mentioned? 
If you mix that with Dark Matter, it turns into some kind of dissolving agent. 
Anything which is melded into it retains its original properties, so we could experiment with mixing different things together. 
Therefore, if you find anything that looks promising, bring it over right away, and we can see what we get."
memorial_42_04_name,04.wav
memorial_42_04_description,"Based on the results we've gotten so far, anything that gets dissolved retains every last one of its traits afterwards.
There doesn't seem to be a limit to this, either. I've tested materials containing up to 141 traits, and every single one carried over. 
Of course, the effectiveness of each individual trait leaves much to be desired. It's like they're all jammed together into one conglomerate.
That means the key point is being selective and focused.
From now on, instead of wantonly grabbing anything we can get our hands on, we should be more discerning. 
Got that? Quality over quantity."

memorial_44_01_description,"There are several parts near the volcano presumed to belong to the Fire Dragon.
While they are few in number, they should be collected due to their value.
But what are these parts doing there?
It seems unlikely that the Fire Dragon would be beaten so thoroughly.
Could there have been some infighting among its kind?"
memorial_44_02_name,Near the Ruins
memorial_44_02_description,"While it might be a bit far to say for sure, there appear to be parts belonging to Scorpion and Chatterbox near the ancient castle ruins.
Not sure how they got there, but it's probably a good idea to snatch them up.
Come to think of it, the combination is odd.
What are Scorpion and Chatterbox parts doing in the same location?
At any rate, I'm making a note of it."

memorial_44_03_description,"I'm fairly certain there's something here, but I'm not entirely sure.
I think I'll need to dig to find out for sure, but honestly, I have no idea where to start.
I should set aside a day to try digging."
memorial_44_04_name,Near the Ark
memorial_44_04_description,"There seems to be something underground near the Ark. 
My intuition tells me it's incredibly valuable.
Valuable enough that it's worth pursuing despite it being so deep underground and there being so many Raptures nearby.
Still, it seems worth the risk."

memorial_45_01_name,001.wav
memorial_45_01_description,"You guys saw the Silver Liquid here, didn't you? 
It dissolves anything it touches, so stay far away from it.
Don't ever touch it. Never, ever!
Not even the tip of your finger or the teeniest tip of your toe.
Don't so much as think about it. Don't even go near it.
Don't say I didn't warn you. If you come into contact with that stuff, you're dead meat. 
I'm not speaking in metaphors here. You'll be dead as a doornail!"
memorial_45_02_name,002.wav
memorial_45_02_description,"Anything that touches the Silver Liquid melts and turns into more Silver Liquid. 
The only exception seems to be organic objects.
Don't even think for a second that we're in the clear because we're partially composed of organic parts. How can you be sure how much of us is organic and how much isn't?
You know the silver tree? The one that bears golden apples?
The moment your curiosity gets the best of you and you approach it, you're done for.
Streams of Silver Liquid will burst out like a geyser, so stay far away from it.
If, for whatever reason you can't avoid coming into contact with the Silver Liquid, use Dark Matter.
Dark Matter doesn't simply turn into more Silver Liquid. Instead, it actually mixes with it.
However, if too much gets mixed in, the Dark Matter will be assimilated into the Silver Liquid. Therefore, once you've mixed the two, you must be sure to remove the Dark Matter as soon as possible."
memorial_45_03_name,003.wav
memorial_45_03_description,"Why did I make such a dangerous place my hideout?
Remember how I said that the Silver Liquid can mix with Dark Matter?
If you mix the two at a precise 1:1 ratio, the resulting combination retains both the melding properties of the Silver Liquid and the unique properties of Dark Matter. 
Anything that melts here keeps its original traits intact, so it's perfect for creating ""eggs"". 
While this place may be dangerous, it's worth the risk."
memorial_45_04_name,004.wav
memorial_45_04_description,"If all kinds of rare materials were melted into this unique mixture and made into an egg, surely the resulting creation would be something incredible, right?

memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_01_description,"I'm not sure how long it's been since I finished making this bubble garden inside Gluttony. A month, maybe?
(I sometimes forget to keep track of the days, so it's not exact.)
What can I do now...
How can I let them know that I'm still here?
What if Cinderella or Abe is in danger?
What if the mission to climb the Lift failed? What if that thing is still out there in space, forever a looming threat?

Is there any way to help them?
Is there really nothing I can do?
Lately, that's all I've been thinking about."
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_02_name,Entry 2
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_02_description,"I think I've found something I can do.
I sent out a few bubbles into the expanse, and while investigating Gluttony's insides, I discovered what seems to be a sort of breathing hole that opens once a week.
Perhaps I can send out bubbles from there and let everyone know that I'm here.
There might still be a way for me to help.

Right. The bubbles should work.
Abe is the one who gave them to me, after all.
I should try sending one up as a test today."
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_03_name,Entry 3
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_03_description,"After successfully sending a bubble up to the surface,
I've decided to create more of them in the workshop.

There are two things these bubbles need to do.
First: Let my friends know that I'm inside Gluttony.
Second: Create a sheltering screen of some kind to help keep my friends away from the gaze of that thing, which might still be out there.

Given my current situation and strength, it'd be impossible for me to defeat that thing alone. So, just like how I created a bubble veil to shield myself from Gluttony's core, I will make a massive membrane to hide Cinderella, Abe, and everyone else from that thing so they can't be found.

If I know Cinderella and Abe, they'll definitely find a way to defeat that thing, so even if something terrible happens to them, someone else will be able to defeat i... (smudged by tears).
No. They're alive. I have to believe that.
What I need to do is buy them some time.
This is how I can help everyone!"
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_04_name,Entry 4
memorial_unbreakablesphere_01_04_description,"I succeeded in creating a bubble that looks like Cinderella, which will be the first bubble I send to the surface.
I used energy extracted from Gluttony's silver liquid as the building material.
(I never thought Gluttony's silver liquid could be used in so many ways. Guess there's truth to the saying, ""He who creates a poison also has the cure."")

I designed it so that when this doppelganger meets the real Cinderella on the surface, it will reach out to her.
If it's the Cinderella I know, I'm sure she'll reach out and hold its hand.
Then it will become a bubble and lead her back to where I am. To Gluttony.
If that happens, I'm positive I will be able to see them again.

I imbued it with a Kotodama that will cause it to dissolve and become a bubble cloud if it meets no one after half a year.
When those clouds congregate, they will form a giant veil that will render them invisible to the Queen.

I hope this plan succeeds.
Even if I'm digested by Gluttony one day and disappear into a mass of bubbles, I hope I'll have done my part to help save the world."
memorial_46_name,Neatly Written Record
memorial_46_description,A great record that will one day change the world.
memorial_46_01_name,Record 1: A Great Change
memorial_46_01_description,"After bidding farewell to a dear friend and setting off on a long journey, I encouraged Whaley to go vegetarian.
At first, Whaley stubbornly refused, but after a few tries,
it seemed to develop a liking for the new flavor and now eats only plant-based food without hesitation.

Then, an astonishing transformation began.
Whaley's color gradually shifted from red to blue.
Now, it is entirely blue, looking distinctly different from other Mother Whales.
Its personality changed dramatically as well, becoming noticeably more mild-mannered.

This proves that a Rapture's appearance changes according to its diet.
What a remarkable transformation this is!

It demonstrates that by adopting a vegetarian diet, Raptures can survive without harming humans, animals, or Nikkes,
and that we can coexist peacefully on this land without hostility.
We have taken a significant step closer to peace between Raptures and humanity!

I will continue to observe this change.
May this extraordinary record of such an incredible transformation
one day guide humanity onto a new path."
memorial_46_02_name,Record 2: A Great Change II
memorial_46_02_description,"After Whaley's transformation, I began to notice changes in other Raptures as well.
Perhaps the change in a Tyrant-class entity influenced its subordinates.
Some who had been hostile toward me gradually became friendly and docile.
Even when I built a house on Whaley and walked inside its body, there were no signs of rejection.

What an astounding change this is!
It proves that a change in the leader of a Rapture group can alter the will of its subordinates.

This means that one day, if the Rapture Queen chooses reconciliation with mankind instead of enmity,
a new path will open, and humans will no longer have to fight the Raptures.
In other words, peace is now a real possibility!

I've become deeply hopeful for the new era this remarkable change will bring.
May this record one day reach my dear friend who brought me safely here."
memorial_46_03_name,Record 3: A Great Realization
memorial_46_03_description,"We can communicate.
They can speak!
Today, I finally succeeded in communicating with them—not in their language, but in the language of mankind.

This is clearly different from the times when I merely mimicked their language.
Even though they recognize me as human, they choose to engage in communication.
This once again proves that without the instinctive hostility toward humans, Raptures are simply a new species distinct from mankind.
Even if our languages and ways of communicating differ, as long as we trust one another and desire peace, we can communicate with each other peacefully through dialogue.

I hope this profound realization of mine is conveyed to my dear friend, spreads throughout all of humanity, and ultimately brings mankind and the Raptures one step closer to each other."
memorial_46_04_name,Record 4: A Great Discovery!
memorial_46_04_description,"I've made an incredible discovery.
It's... a new and wondrous phenomenon I never could have foreseen.

Inside Whaley, I found a new life.
This child is neither human, nor Nikke, nor even a Rapture.

Could it be a new species?
Or perhaps a new evolution of the Raptures, born to make peace with humanity?
What new chapter in human history will this great discovery herald?"
