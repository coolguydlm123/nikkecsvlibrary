d_counseling_admi_01_1,"Commander, if you could only choose one..."
d_counseling_admi_01_2,Which do you prefer: dogs or cats?
d_counseling_admi_01_3,I prefer dogs.
d_counseling_admi_01_4,I'm more fond of cats.
d_counseling_admi_01_5,"I see. So you are a dog person, not a cat person."
d_counseling_admi_01_6,Dogs are quite adorable.
d_counseling_admi_01_7,I am fond of cats as well.
d_counseling_admi_01_8,"They may not look like it, but actually they're pretty sad."
d_counseling_admi_01_9,That's why I want to shower them with as much love as possible.
d_counseling_admi_01_10,I talk to Admi about animals.
d_counseling_admi_02_1,"Because of Privaty and me, Yulha ended up overworking herself."
d_counseling_admi_02_2,I'm quite concerned about her.
d_counseling_admi_02_3,Is there anything I can do to help her out?
d_counseling_admi_02_4,Just say 'Thank you.' She would appreciate that.
d_counseling_admi_02_5,Tell her you'll help her with her work from now on.
d_counseling_admi_02_6,Say 'Thank you'?
d_counseling_admi_02_7,I imagine she would be pretty embarrassed to hear me say that...
d_counseling_admi_02_8,"But, you're right. I really should say it to her."
d_counseling_admi_02_9,"That was very helpful. Thank you very much, Commander."
d_counseling_admi_02_10,Hm... I think Yulha would be furious.
d_counseling_admi_02_11,She'd probably tell me to just worry about doing my own job instead of messing with hers.
d_counseling_admi_02_12,"But, thank you anyway. I'll take it into consideration."
d_counseling_admi_02_13,I talk with Admi about Yulha.
d_counseling_admi_03_1,... Privaty.
d_counseling_admi_03_2,When will she ever grow up?
d_counseling_admi_03_3,It'd be better if you just gave up on that idea.
d_counseling_admi_03_4,"Someday, she will. Someday..."
d_counseling_admi_03_5,You think so?
d_counseling_admi_03_6,"So, it is just wishful thinking... It will never happen."
d_counseling_admi_03_7,...
d_counseling_admi_03_8,"Thank you, Commander. Letting go of false hope makes me feel much better."
d_counseling_admi_03_9,Right. Someday...
d_counseling_admi_03_10,...
d_counseling_admi_03_11,*Sigh*
d_counseling_admi_03_12,I pat Admi's back to show some moral support.
d_counseling_admi_04_1,The Outpost is such a weird place.
d_counseling_admi_04_2,"It's smaller than average, but we have a police station and a courthouse."
d_counseling_admi_04_3,"We have a hospital and a train station, too."
d_counseling_admi_04_4,"What's your favorite place in the Outpost, Commander?"
d_counseling_admi_04_5,The Commander's Room.
d_counseling_admi_04_6,"The courthouse, because it's where you are."
d_counseling_admi_04_7,"Oh... I like it, too."
d_counseling_admi_04_8,Because that's where I can see you.
d_counseling_admi_04_9,!!
d_counseling_admi_04_10,"Oh, really? Thank you, Commander..."
d_counseling_admi_04_11,I'm quite glad you feel that way.
d_counseling_admi_04_12,I spend some time talking about the Outpost with Admi.
d_counseling_admi_05_1,"Commander, what kind of weather do you like?"
d_counseling_admi_05_2,Sunny skies.
d_counseling_admi_05_3,Rainy days.
d_counseling_admi_05_4,I see. Sunshine really does seem to make you happy.
d_counseling_admi_05_5,It's the perfect weather for having fun outside.
d_counseling_admi_05_6,I feel the same way. You know how hard combat can be
d_counseling_admi_05_7,"on a rainy day... But, I do enjoy hearing the sound of the rain."
d_counseling_admi_05_8,The melody of rain helps me cope with my loneliness.
d_counseling_admi_05_9,I talk with Admi about the weather.
d_counseling_admi_06_1,"Commander, we are under the command of the Central Government."
d_counseling_admi_06_2,We must treat their orders as our top priority.
d_counseling_admi_06_3,"Are there times when that makes you feel sad, or even hateful toward us?"
d_counseling_admi_06_4,"Yes, there are times."
d_counseling_admi_06_5,Never.
d_counseling_admi_06_6,I knew it. That's entirely normal.
d_counseling_admi_06_7,"But, Commander, you have been always so sincere and kind to us. Thank you."
d_counseling_admi_06_8,Thank you for staying true to us.
d_counseling_admi_06_9,Really?
d_counseling_admi_06_10,...
d_counseling_admi_06_11,"Even if you are not really being honest, thank you for saying that."
d_counseling_admi_06_12,I spend some more quality time with Admi.
d_counseling_admi_07_1,"Commander, do you have an ideal type?"
d_counseling_admi_07_2,Someone who is mature.
d_counseling_admi_07_3,Someone who is cute.
d_counseling_admi_07_4,"Oh, is that so?"
d_counseling_admi_07_5,It is physically impossible for me to look mature.
d_counseling_admi_07_6,I... understand.
d_counseling_admi_07_7,"Then, I guess I'm lucky to look like this."
d_counseling_admi_07_8,"I'm not saying I'm cute, but..."
d_counseling_admi_07_9,"... I feel that if I work hard, I can be closer to the kind of woman you like."
d_counseling_admi_07_10,I talk to Admi about ideal types.
d_counseling_admi_08_1,People always say that no love lasts forever...
d_counseling_admi_08_2,Do you agree with that?
d_counseling_admi_08_3,Eternal love does exist.
d_counseling_admi_08_4,Eternal love is a lie.
d_counseling_admi_08_5,"I knew you would say that, Commander."
d_counseling_admi_08_6,"To be honest, I'm also hoping that such a love really exists."
d_counseling_admi_08_7,"... Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_admi_08_8,"So, Commander, you feel the same as everyone else..."
d_counseling_admi_08_9,"Even so, I always like to think it might be real."
d_counseling_admi_08_10,But... I don't know. Maybe it's not...
d_counseling_admi_08_11,I have a conversation about love with Admi.
d_counseling_admi_09_1,"Commander, where do you go when you want to relax and unwind?"
d_counseling_admi_09_2,"Downtown, somewhere crowded."
d_counseling_admi_09_3,A park without too many people.
d_counseling_admi_09_4,Ah... You like places with a lot of people.
d_counseling_admi_09_5,"When I go to crowded places, I get tired very quickly."
d_counseling_admi_09_6,"But there are plenty of things to keep you entertained downtown. Maybe, that's why you like it."
d_counseling_admi_09_7,I also enjoy quiet places with very few people.
d_counseling_admi_09_8,I feel at peace.
d_counseling_admi_09_9,"Perhaps, when I want to relax, I'll go to the same place as you."
d_counseling_admi_09_10,I have a conversation with Admi about places to relax.
d_counseling_admi_10_1,"They say that to have peace of mind, having a hobby is important."
d_counseling_admi_10_2,I'm thinking of getting one.
d_counseling_admi_10_3,But... I'm not quite sure what kind of hobby to choose.
d_counseling_admi_10_4,What about looking at cat pictures? Or taking cat pictures?
d_counseling_admi_10_5,What about exercising?
d_counseling_admi_10_6,Pictures of cats?
d_counseling_admi_10_7,...
d_counseling_admi_10_8,That sounds nice. I will start today.
d_counseling_admi_10_9,Working out might be too hard for me.
d_counseling_admi_10_10,It would feel too much like training.
d_counseling_admi_10_11,Oh! I'm sorry.
d_counseling_admi_10_12,Let... let me think about it.
d_counseling_admi_10_13,I have a conversation with Admi about hobbies.
d_counseling_admi_11_1,Every beginning has an end.
d_counseling_admi_11_2,"If everything is bound to end, then why bother trying?"
d_counseling_admi_11_3,"What are your thoughts, Commander?"
d_counseling_admi_11_4,You just need to start fresh.
d_counseling_admi_11_5,"I can't give up, not until I know how it all ends."
d_counseling_admi_11_6,You think so?
d_counseling_admi_11_7,"Even if you start something new, it will end eventually."
d_counseling_admi_11_8,Don't you find the repetition exhausting?
d_counseling_admi_11_9,It's a little hard to understand.
d_counseling_admi_11_10,How it all ends...
d_counseling_admi_11_11,"I suppose you could define ""end"" in various ways."
d_counseling_admi_11_12,Surely one of those definitions must include a happy ending.
d_counseling_admi_11_13,That seems like a good mindset.
d_counseling_admi_11_14,Admi and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_admi_12_1,I wanted to get Yulha something for always working so hard.
d_counseling_admi_12_2,Any ideas?
d_counseling_admi_12_3,A vacation.
d_counseling_admi_12_4,Some alcohol.
d_counseling_admi_12_5,Yulha would never go for that.
d_counseling_admi_12_6,"If she relaxed for even a minute, she'd fall behind in her work."
d_counseling_admi_12_7,"I'm grateful for what she does, but I feel a little bad for her too."
d_counseling_admi_12_8,"It's not good to rely on alcohol,"
d_counseling_admi_12_9,but it's probably the only way she can get outside of her head.
d_counseling_admi_12_10,Thanks for the suggestion!
d_counseling_admi_12_11,Admi and I talk about Yulha.
d_counseling_admi_13_1,"What type of music do you typically listen to, Commander?"
d_counseling_admi_13_2,Subdued and solemn music.
d_counseling_admi_13_3,Upbeat and exciting music.
d_counseling_admi_13_4,I like that kind of music too.
d_counseling_admi_13_5,Sitting in the park and listening to music puts me at ease.
d_counseling_admi_13_6,Would you like to come with me some time?
d_counseling_admi_13_7,I see.
d_counseling_admi_13_8,I tend to prefer more subdued music.
d_counseling_admi_13_9,"However, if you can recommend me some more upbeat music, I'd love to hear it."
d_counseling_admi_13_10,Admi and I talk about our taste in music.
d_counseling_admi_14_1,"I've been having a lot of nightmares lately, so mornings have been tough."
d_counseling_admi_14_2,Do you dream often?
d_counseling_admi_14_3,"Yes, all the time."
d_counseling_admi_14_4,"No, not very often."
d_counseling_admi_14_5,Really?
d_counseling_admi_14_6,Does that not wear you out mentally?
d_counseling_admi_14_7,I hope you at least have good dreams.
d_counseling_admi_14_8,I'm glad to hear that.
d_counseling_admi_14_9,Dreaming a lot when you sleep can be pretty taxing.
d_counseling_admi_14_10,It's nice to hear that you sleep soundly.
d_counseling_admi_14_11,Admi and I discuss dreams.
d_counseling_admi_15_1,Commander.
d_counseling_admi_15_2,"If we manage to reclaim the surface, how would you feel?"
d_counseling_admi_15_3,I'd be elated.
d_counseling_admi_15_4,I'm not sure how I'd feel.
d_counseling_admi_15_5,I knew you would feel that way.
d_counseling_admi_15_6,I would be happy too.
d_counseling_admi_15_7,I hope that day will come soon.
d_counseling_admi_15_8,"Oh, is that so?"
d_counseling_admi_15_9,I thought for sure you'd be happy.
d_counseling_admi_15_10,It seems that there's still a lot I don't know about you.
d_counseling_admi_15_11,Admi and I discuss the surface and its future.
d_counseling_admi_16_1,"Commander, are you any good at claw machines?"
d_counseling_admi_16_2,There's one in front of the convenience store.
d_counseling_admi_16_3,I tried it several times but can't seem to grab anything.
d_counseling_admi_16_4,I'm the claw machine master.
d_counseling_admi_16_5,"Honestly, I'm not very good."
d_counseling_admi_16_6,Is that true?!
d_counseling_admi_16_7,Can you come with me next time then?
d_counseling_admi_16_8,I'll buy you a tasty treat afterward.
d_counseling_admi_16_9,That's too bad...
d_counseling_admi_16_10,Guess I just need to practice some more.
d_counseling_admi_16_11,"When I get good enough, I'll be sure to snag something for you!"
d_counseling_admi_16_12,Admi and I talked about claw machines.
d_counseling_admi_17_1,Have you tried any of the food up on the surface?
d_counseling_admi_17_2,I tried grapes for the first time a few days ago.
d_counseling_admi_17_3,I've never tasted anything so sweet.
d_counseling_admi_17_4,I've eaten a lot.
d_counseling_admi_17_5,I've barely tried anything.
d_counseling_admi_17_6,What did you find the most memorable?
d_counseling_admi_17_7,"If I ever have the opportunity, I'd like to try some different things."
d_counseling_admi_17_8,Although it'd taste even better if you and I could eat it together...
d_counseling_admi_17_9,No kidding...
d_counseling_admi_17_10,I thought you would have tried all sorts of stuff.
d_counseling_admi_17_11,"If I come across any more, I'll make sure to invite you."
d_counseling_admi_17_12,Admi and I talk about food up on the surface.
d_counseling_admi_18_1,"Commander, out of curiosity, is there anything you would like as a gift?"
d_counseling_admi_18_2,Your time.
d_counseling_admi_18_3,A cat doll.
d_counseling_admi_18_4,M-my time?
d_counseling_admi_18_5,Well... you can have it anytime.
d_counseling_admi_18_6,Um...
d_counseling_admi_18_7,Are you sure that's what you want?
d_counseling_admi_18_8,You don't need to be so considerate of me.
d_counseling_admi_18_9,Admi and I talk about gifts.
d_counseling_admi_19_1,There were a lot of books about cats at the library.
d_counseling_admi_19_2,I ended up borrowing 6 books all at once.
d_counseling_admi_19_3,I may have gone a bit overboard.
d_counseling_admi_19_4,Just a tad.
d_counseling_admi_19_5,"Not at all, as long as you finish reading all of them."
d_counseling_admi_19_6,I don't know when I'll find time to read them all...
d_counseling_admi_19_7,There may be other people waiting to read them as well.
d_counseling_admi_19_8,I better go return a few of them.
d_counseling_admi_19_9,"You're right, but I don't know when I'll find time to read them all."
d_counseling_admi_19_10,... But thank you for putting a positive spin on all this.
d_counseling_admi_19_11,I'll try to read them as fast as I can.
d_counseling_admi_19_12,Admi and I have a back and forth about the books she borrowed.
d_counseling_admi_20_1,Cats are so adorable when they meow.
d_counseling_admi_20_2,"How do they make that sound, I wonder?"
d_counseling_admi_20_3,*Meow*
d_counseling_admi_20_4,Not as cute as your voice.
d_counseling_admi_20_5,Hmmph.
d_counseling_admi_20_6,"Your voice is too deep, it doesn't sound like a cat at all."
d_counseling_admi_20_7,Can you try again?
d_counseling_admi_20_8,"...Oh, thank you!"
d_counseling_admi_20_9,This is the first time I've been complimented about my voice...
d_counseling_admi_20_10,I'm a little embarrassed.
d_counseling_admi_20_11,Admi and I get into the nitty-gritty about cats and their meows.
d_counseling_alice_01_1,"Rabbit in the mountains, rabbit in the meadow, where does the rabbit want to go?"
d_counseling_alice_01_2,"Hiya, Rabbity! Where is the rabbit in this song going?"
d_counseling_alice_01_3,"Naturally, rabbits prefer the hills."
d_counseling_alice_01_4,It's searching for a happier world.
d_counseling_alice_01_5,The hills?
d_counseling_alice_01_6,That sounds like a far-away place!
d_counseling_alice_01_7,"Come on, rabbit! I believe in you!"
d_counseling_alice_01_8,Whoa!
d_counseling_alice_01_9,She's really looking for a happier world!
d_counseling_alice_01_10,That's so cool!
d_counseling_alice_01_11,Alice and I sing some songs and have a good time together.
d_counseling_alice_02_1,"Hey, Rabbity. I was wondering."
d_counseling_alice_02_2,What if Sleeping Beauty gets hungry while she's sleeping?
d_counseling_alice_02_3,She'll have plenty to feast on in her dreams.
d_counseling_alice_02_4,"If she gets hungry, she'll wake up."
d_counseling_alice_02_5,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_alice_02_6,I never thought about all the great food in her dreams!
d_counseling_alice_02_7,Now I don't have to worry about her anymore!
d_counseling_alice_02_8,Really? She'll get up?
d_counseling_alice_02_9,"Then we'll need to have some food ready for her, right?"
d_counseling_alice_02_10,Hmm... that's a lot of work.
d_counseling_alice_02_11,Alice and I have a serious conversation about Sleeping Beauty.
d_counseling_alice_03_1,The Queen has brought soooooo much snow.
d_counseling_alice_03_2,Is there a way we can ask her to stop?
d_counseling_alice_03_3,We could soothe her nerves with a cup of black tea.
d_counseling_alice_03_4,"Actually, the snow has nothing to do with Ludmilla."
d_counseling_alice_03_5,!!
d_counseling_alice_03_6,"You're right! If the Queen is in a good mood, she won't bring any more snow!"
d_counseling_alice_03_7,You're a genius!
d_counseling_alice_03_8,Really? How can that be?
d_counseling_alice_03_9,Oh no! Does this mean the Queen is losing control of her powers?
d_counseling_alice_03_10,This is no good. No good at all!
d_counseling_alice_03_11,Alice and I chat about Ludmilla for a while.
d_counseling_alice_04_1,"Speaking of carrots,"
d_counseling_alice_04_2,which taste do you prefer – sweet or salty?
d_counseling_alice_04_3,"Actually, I don't like carrots at all."
d_counseling_alice_04_4,I like salty-sweet carrots.
d_counseling_alice_04_5,!!
d_counseling_alice_04_6,Really?
d_counseling_alice_04_7,So strange...
d_counseling_alice_04_8,I thought carrots were every rabbit's favorite food!
d_counseling_alice_04_9,Salty-sweet?
d_counseling_alice_04_10,I never knew there were salty-sweet carrots!
d_counseling_alice_04_11,I bet they taste soooo good!
d_counseling_alice_04_12,I discuss the flavors of carrots with Alice.
d_counseling_alice_05_1,Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_05_2,I heard that people in the Ark eat some kind of food called Splendamin.
d_counseling_alice_05_3,What makes Splendamin so splendid?
d_counseling_alice_05_4,It puts you in a splendid mood.
d_counseling_alice_05_5,It gives you a splendid body.
d_counseling_alice_05_6,Splendid mood?
d_counseling_alice_05_7,That's amazing! A splendid mood!
d_counseling_alice_05_8,Amazing!
d_counseling_alice_05_9,Body?
d_counseling_alice_05_10,"Wow! So, you must have a splendid body, too!"
d_counseling_alice_05_11,I have a good talk with Alice about Splendamin.
d_counseling_alice_06_1,"Speaking of weather,"
d_counseling_alice_06_2,what kind of weather do you prefer: sunny or snowy?
d_counseling_alice_06_3,Sunny.
d_counseling_alice_06_4,Snowy.
d_counseling_alice_06_5,"I like sunny days too,"
d_counseling_alice_06_6,but I like snowy days more!
d_counseling_alice_06_7,That's because our Queen is the Snow Queen!
d_counseling_alice_06_8,I love our Queen's snow as well!
d_counseling_alice_06_9,"The snow is cold, and it can be really scary sometimes..."
d_counseling_alice_06_10,But I love it anyway! It's the same color as our Queen.
d_counseling_alice_06_11,I have a good talk with Alice about the Snow Queen.
d_counseling_alice_07_1,Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_07_2,Why don't the Queen of Hearts' minions need to sleep?
d_counseling_alice_07_3,"I don't think I've ever seen them go to sleep, not even once."
d_counseling_alice_07_4,They're under an insomnia spell.
d_counseling_alice_07_5,That's why we have to make them all go to sleep.
d_counseling_alice_07_6,Ooh... really?
d_counseling_alice_07_7,"The Queen of Hearts' minions are all big meanies,"
d_counseling_alice_07_8,but I still feel sorry for them.
d_counseling_alice_07_9,You're right! If they can't go to sleep by themselves...
d_counseling_alice_07_10,We can give them a little help!
d_counseling_alice_07_11,You're a real genius!
d_counseling_alice_07_12,"I have a good talk with Alice about the minions of the Queen of Heart, Raptures."
d_counseling_alice_08_1,"Rabbit in the mountains, oh, come drink by the spring."
d_counseling_alice_08_2,"Rabbit in the morning, rubbing its eyes."
d_counseling_alice_08_3,Oh! Rabbit! Do you always wake up this early?
d_counseling_alice_08_4,That's right! I'm gonna go drink some spring water.
d_counseling_alice_08_5,I was just sleepwalking.
d_counseling_alice_08_6,Whoa! Early birds are the best!
d_counseling_alice_08_7,"From now on, I'll wake up early with you! I promise!"
d_counseling_alice_08_8,Mmm-hmm. Sounds fishy to me.
d_counseling_alice_08_9,How did you go to the spring
d_counseling_alice_08_10,if you were sleepwalking?
d_counseling_alice_08_11,I have a discussion on the way to the spring with Alice for a while.
d_counseling_alice_09_1,"Rabbity, the fat's in the fire!"
d_counseling_alice_09_2,The Queen is so powerful that the machines have been taken down one after another!
d_counseling_alice_09_3,I don't know what to do.
d_counseling_alice_09_4,Let them stay hidden.
d_counseling_alice_09_5,They will be fine as long as you stay with Ludmilla all the time.
d_counseling_alice_09_6,That won't do at all.
d_counseling_alice_09_7,"I've tried that long ago,"
d_counseling_alice_09_8,"but the Queen told me that, it would be more difficult to rescue the lost princess."
d_counseling_alice_09_9,Ok! I will!
d_counseling_alice_09_10,"After all, I like being with her."
d_counseling_alice_09_11,I have a discussion about rescuing the machines with Alice for a while.
d_counseling_alice_10_1,"Hey, Rabbity! Don't fall asleep in the middle of a race!"
d_counseling_alice_10_2,Remember?
d_counseling_alice_10_3,I won't take part in any race.
d_counseling_alice_10_4,OK. I will try my best in every race.
d_counseling_alice_10_5,Huh? Why not?
d_counseling_alice_10_6,Have you quit racing?
d_counseling_alice_10_7,Hmph. Good!
d_counseling_alice_10_8,I'll be your number one fan.
d_counseling_alice_10_9,I'll watch you win all the races!
d_counseling_alice_10_10,I chat with Alice about how to beat tortoises in a race.
d_counseling_alice_11_1,Hey Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_11_2,"Whenever you sleep, do you dream?"
d_counseling_alice_11_3,Not very often.
d_counseling_alice_11_4,All the time.
d_counseling_alice_11_5,"Darn, that's too bad."
d_counseling_alice_11_6,"If you did, I was going to ask what you dreamed about."
d_counseling_alice_11_7,So you're just like me!
d_counseling_alice_11_8,I dream all the time about you and I running around
d_counseling_alice_11_9,"in a field of flowers together, without a care in the world."
d_counseling_alice_11_10,What do you dream about?
d_counseling_alice_11_11,Alice and I talk about dreams.
d_counseling_alice_12_1,The snow is really piling up today!
d_counseling_alice_12_2,What do you like to do whenever it snows?
d_counseling_alice_12_3,Have a snowball fight.
d_counseling_alice_12_4,Make a snowman.
d_counseling_alice_12_5,"Wow, that sounds cool!"
d_counseling_alice_12_6,I've never done that before.
d_counseling_alice_12_7,Wanna have a snowball fight with me?
d_counseling_alice_12_8,"I wanted to do something a little different today,"
d_counseling_alice_12_9,but since you really enjoy making snowmen...
d_counseling_alice_12_10,I can make another one.
d_counseling_alice_12_11,Alice and I try and come up with other snow-related activities.
d_counseling_alice_13_1,"Doo dah, doo dee dah..."
d_counseling_alice_13_2,"Rabbity, sing with me!"
d_counseling_alice_13_3,Join in and complement her singing.
d_counseling_alice_13_4,Sing along jokingly.
d_counseling_alice_13_5,Whoa!
d_counseling_alice_13_6,You sing so well!
d_counseling_alice_13_7,Sing it again!
d_counseling_alice_13_8,"Hmm, that doesn't quite gel..."
d_counseling_alice_13_9,"Still, I'm glad to see you enjoying yourself."
d_counseling_alice_13_10,Alice and I have fun singing together.
d_counseling_alice_14_1,"You must have other animal friends, right?"
d_counseling_alice_14_2,What other animal friends are you close with?
d_counseling_alice_14_3,A tortoise.
d_counseling_alice_14_4,A dog.
d_counseling_alice_14_5,"Wait, rabbits and tortoises don't get along!"
d_counseling_alice_14_6,They had that big disagreement over that race...
d_counseling_alice_14_7,"Oh, so you have a dog friend?"
d_counseling_alice_14_8,What's its name?
d_counseling_alice_14_9,Poli.
d_counseling_alice_14_10,"Hey, I know a policewoman with the same name!"
d_counseling_alice_14_11,Alice and I have a conversation about animal friends.
d_counseling_alice_15_1,Hey Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_15_2,Have you ever eaten snow before?
d_counseling_alice_15_3,"Sure, I've eaten snow that's fallen on the ground."
d_counseling_alice_15_4,Never.
d_counseling_alice_15_5,Wow!
d_counseling_alice_15_6,I've only had snow that's coming down from the sky.
d_counseling_alice_15_7,I wonder if it tastes any different once it's hit the ground.
d_counseling_alice_15_8,Let's try some next time we run across it.
d_counseling_alice_15_9,I can't believe you still haven't tried it!
d_counseling_alice_15_10,"You can't eat snow once it melts,"
d_counseling_alice_15_11,so make sure you try it before then.
d_counseling_alice_15_12,Alice and I talk about the taste of snow.
d_counseling_alice_16_1,I'm in the mood for cotton candy today.
d_counseling_alice_16_2,"Do you like cotton candy, Rabbity?"
d_counseling_alice_16_3,I like it because it's sweet.
d_counseling_alice_16_4,"Not really, I think it's too sweet."
d_counseling_alice_16_5,I figured you would!
d_counseling_alice_16_6,Let's have some together next time.
d_counseling_alice_16_7,I want some that are pink-colored!
d_counseling_alice_16_8,But that's why I like it so much...
d_counseling_alice_16_9,I guess you don't have a big sweet tooth.
d_counseling_alice_16_10,Alice and I talk about cotton candy.
d_counseling_alice_17_1,"Whenever I can't fall asleep,"
d_counseling_alice_17_2,"I imagine you and I are having tea time, Rabbity."
d_counseling_alice_17_3,What goes through your mind when you can't fall asleep?
d_counseling_alice_17_4,I imagine tea time with you.
d_counseling_alice_17_5,I lay down and try to keep my mind blank.
d_counseling_alice_17_6,"Wow, so we've been thinking about the same thing!"
d_counseling_alice_17_7,Hopefully we can run into each other in our dreams.
d_counseling_alice_17_8,I'll be sure to prepare some scrumptious treats for you.
d_counseling_alice_17_9,Don't you get bored just laying down not thinking about anything?
d_counseling_alice_17_10,It'd be more fun
d_counseling_alice_17_11,if you tried to imagine something...
d_counseling_alice_17_12,Alice and I talk about imagination.
d_counseling_alice_18_1,I'm making cookies with the Queen today!
d_counseling_alice_18_2,I'll give you some once I finish.
d_counseling_alice_18_3,What should I make them look like?
d_counseling_alice_18_4,Like a rabbit.
d_counseling_alice_18_5,Like a snowman.
d_counseling_alice_18_6,"Whoa, freaky!"
d_counseling_alice_18_7,I was thinking the exact same thing!
d_counseling_alice_18_8,Our minds are in sync.
d_counseling_alice_18_9,I'll try and make it extra delicious for you!
d_counseling_alice_18_10,I thought you'd want it to be shaped like a rabbit...
d_counseling_alice_18_11,But I can try and go for a snowman.
d_counseling_alice_18_12,I eagerly anticipated trying Alice's delicious cookies.
d_counseling_alice_19_1,Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_19_2,Would a cloud melt like cotton candy does?
d_counseling_alice_19_3,"Sure, and it would probably taste the same as well."
d_counseling_alice_19_4,I doubt it.
d_counseling_alice_19_5,So it'd taste similar as well?!
d_counseling_alice_19_6,That'd be amazing!
d_counseling_alice_19_7,I hope I can try eating some actual clouds one day.
d_counseling_alice_19_8,Really?
d_counseling_alice_19_9,"Oh, I thought they'd be similar..."
d_counseling_alice_19_10,Alice and I converse about clouds.
d_counseling_alice_20_1,Hey Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_20_2,"If you were the main character in a movie, what would you be?"
d_counseling_alice_20_3,A hatmaker.
d_counseling_alice_20_4,Alice.
d_counseling_alice_20_5,I think you'd make a great hatmaker!
d_counseling_alice_20_6,You and I could have a tea party every day.
d_counseling_alice_20_7,We'd have so much fun!
d_counseling_alice_20_8,Uh... but Alice is who I want to be...
d_counseling_alice_20_9,What about another role?
d_counseling_alice_20_10,Alice and I fantasize about being movie protagonists.
d_counseling_anis_01_1,"Hey, Commander, when you see a lady, which place do you look first?"
d_counseling_anis_01_2,I want an honest answer.
d_counseling_anis_01_3,Her face.
d_counseling_anis_01_4,Her heart.
d_counseling_anis_01_5,"Hah!
I always knew you were a face guy."
d_counseling_anis_01_6,"Huh? No?
Then which part do you think is the most important?"
d_counseling_anis_01_7,Ugh! What a corny answer.
d_counseling_anis_01_8,How can you see a woman's heart at the first glance?
d_counseling_anis_01_9,I have a conversation about ideal types with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_02_1,"Should I take a shower before going to bed,"
d_counseling_anis_02_2,or after getting up?
d_counseling_anis_02_3,I didn't go outside today.
d_counseling_anis_02_4,Then you don't need a shower at all.
d_counseling_anis_02_5,Then shower twice!
d_counseling_anis_02_6,...
d_counseling_anis_02_7,"Hey, I'm serious!"
d_counseling_anis_02_8,It's only proper to take a shower at least once a day.
d_counseling_anis_02_9,"That would be nice, but I'm afraid there is not enough hot water."
d_counseling_anis_02_10,"Hey, why don't I take a shower in your room?"
d_counseling_anis_02_11,Anis and I discuss body wash and shampoo.
d_counseling_anis_03_1,"As a Nikke, I've always got my hands full.
But sometimes, I have to wonder... what's the point of all this?"
d_counseling_anis_03_2,"I can't find much joy in my work,
 but there's nothing else I can do."
d_counseling_anis_03_3,"Commander, what do you think I should do?"
d_counseling_anis_03_4,"Not everyone finds joy in their work, and that's okay."
d_counseling_anis_03_5,You can try to find joy in your work.
d_counseling_anis_03_6,"Hmm... You're right.
A job is just a job, after all."
d_counseling_anis_03_7,Only a few geniuses can find meaning in their work.
d_counseling_anis_03_8,Never mind. I just need to work hard. That's enough.
d_counseling_anis_03_9,Joy... Joy...
d_counseling_anis_03_10,Didn't that kind of thing go away a long time ago?
d_counseling_anis_03_11,Anis tells me her tricks for slacking off at work.
d_counseling_anis_04_1,"Argh!!
Commander, I can't stand Liter any more!"
d_counseling_anis_04_2,Her constant nagging is driving me crazy!
d_counseling_anis_04_3,So what if I leave my dirty socks lying around?
d_counseling_anis_04_4,Because she's the one who does the cleaning.
d_counseling_anis_04_5,Socks? Where?
d_counseling_anis_04_6,"That's true, I admit..."
d_counseling_anis_04_7,But I did pick up all my socks today.
d_counseling_anis_04_8,"It may have been my fault in the past, but today I'm perfectly innocent."
d_counseling_anis_04_9,Huh?
d_counseling_anis_04_10,Commander... are you really into that kind of thing?
d_counseling_anis_04_11,"If you... if you really want my socks, maybe I can show you."
d_counseling_anis_04_12,Anis and I discuss good socks.
d_counseling_anis_05_1,"Neon's crazy, I reckon."
d_counseling_anis_05_2,She's a firepower maniac.
d_counseling_anis_05_3,That's why she excels at what she does.
d_counseling_anis_05_4,You shouldn't say that about your teammate.
d_counseling_anis_05_5,"I know, right? She's a complete maniac."
d_counseling_anis_05_6,"But, in a way, I envy her. She has something that she's passionate about."
d_counseling_anis_05_7,"Even if it's something weird, like firepower."
d_counseling_anis_05_8,I don't mean she lost her mind or whatever.
d_counseling_anis_05_9,"And I also didn't mean... Pfft... 
How to put this..."
d_counseling_anis_05_10,"Forget about it, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_05_11,"Anis and I discuss the definition of a ""maniac""."
d_counseling_anis_06_1,"Chocolate-flavored Splendamin, and chocolate."
d_counseling_anis_06_2,"The former is cheap and common, and the latter is expensive and rare."
d_counseling_anis_06_3,"However, they have the same taste."
d_counseling_anis_06_4,"So, which one is better in the end?"
d_counseling_anis_06_5,Chocolate.
d_counseling_anis_06_6,Chocolate-flavored Splendamin.
d_counseling_anis_06_7,"Hmm... Really?
Your choice surprises me."
d_counseling_anis_06_8,"Since different paths lead to the same destination, why bother taking the hard path?"
d_counseling_anis_06_9,The path itself is meaningless.
d_counseling_anis_06_10,Absolutely!
d_counseling_anis_06_11,"Since different paths lead to the same destination, I think it's wise to take the easy path."
d_counseling_anis_06_12,That's the only way to lead an easy life.
d_counseling_anis_06_13,Anis and I talk about all the different kinds of chocolate.
d_counseling_anis_07_1,Rapi is amazing.
d_counseling_anis_07_2,"She has suffered so much, but she's still so determined."
d_counseling_anis_07_3,She's so different from me.
d_counseling_anis_07_4,Sometimes I just can't figure out why we were put in the same squad.
d_counseling_anis_07_5,Your differences are what make you work well together.
d_counseling_anis_07_6,You have many strengths as well.
d_counseling_anis_07_7,"Huh! So, it because we complement each other?"
d_counseling_anis_07_8,"That's good to hear!
Thanks! You've really cheered me up."
d_counseling_anis_07_9,"... After all, I don't want Rapi to hate me or anything."
d_counseling_anis_07_10,Me? That's impossible.
d_counseling_anis_07_11,"How to put this?
I just live my life aimlessly."
d_counseling_anis_07_12,"I have nothing to live for, but I don't want to die, either.
I'm like some kind of zombie."
d_counseling_anis_07_13,I listen to Anis praising Rapi in a thousand different ways.
d_counseling_anis_08_1,I've been talking in my sleep a lot lately.
d_counseling_anis_08_2,"Last night, Neon woke me up
and asked me why I keep babbling on..."
d_counseling_anis_08_3,... Should I ask Mary for medical treatment?
d_counseling_anis_08_4,Did you apologize to Neon?
d_counseling_anis_08_5,Seems like you've been under a lot of pressure recently.
d_counseling_anis_08_6,I don't even know what I should apologize for.
d_counseling_anis_08_7,"... Hey, wait a minute."
d_counseling_anis_08_8,What if Neon was lying to me?
d_counseling_anis_08_9,"You make a good point.
After all, times have been tough since we met."
d_counseling_anis_08_10,"Ah, please don't get me wrong. I don't mean I dislike being with you."
d_counseling_anis_08_11,I'm just under so much pressure.
d_counseling_anis_08_12,I share some advice about getting better sleep with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_09_1,How strange! My shoulder got stiff all of a sudden...
d_counseling_anis_09_2,But I don't think there is anything wrong with it.
d_counseling_anis_09_3,Maybe because your shoulder is too heavy.
d_counseling_anis_09_4,"... Anis, there's a person on your shoulder."
d_counseling_anis_09_5,...
d_counseling_anis_09_6,"Hee-hee.
That's for sure. I'm confident about my shoulder."
d_counseling_anis_09_7,"Commander, do you want to have a try?
Just once."
d_counseling_anis_09_8,Waaaah!
d_counseling_anis_09_9,...
d_counseling_anis_09_10,"... Commander,
please don't tease me like that!"
d_counseling_anis_09_11,I practice stretching out stiff shoulders with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_10_1,"Commander, this uniform I'm wearing..."
d_counseling_anis_10_2,"It's a gift from my boss, Mustang."
d_counseling_anis_10_3,Do you think it's a little bit...
d_counseling_anis_10_4,Bizarre? Kind of.
d_counseling_anis_10_5,You look gorgeous in it.
d_counseling_anis_10_6,Is... that so?
d_counseling_anis_10_7,Should get something else to change into?
d_counseling_anis_10_8,Ah... I may not have enough money.
d_counseling_anis_10_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_anis_10_10,"Anyway, if you really think so, then..."
d_counseling_anis_10_11,Feel free to look at it as much as you want.
d_counseling_anis_10_12,I discuss fashion with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_11_1,"Commander, could I ask you..."
d_counseling_anis_11_2,do you like boy bands and girl groups?
d_counseling_anis_11_3,"No real reason, I'm just curious, that's all."
d_counseling_anis_11_4,I would literally die without them.
d_counseling_anis_11_5,I don't have much interest in them.
d_counseling_anis_11_6,You're that much of a fan?
d_counseling_anis_11_7,What group do you like the best? Spotlight or Dome of Eternity?
d_counseling_anis_11_8,"They're kind of older, but have you heard of T.T.?"
d_counseling_anis_11_9,Hmmm... as expected.
d_counseling_anis_11_10,I figured you would feel that way.
d_counseling_anis_11_11,"Then, are there any other singers or celebrities that you like?"
d_counseling_anis_11_12,Anis and I have a lovely conversation about celebrities.
d_counseling_anis_12_1,"I found a wallet once before, and it ended up being a horrible experience."
d_counseling_anis_12_2,"Ever since then, I tend not to help others."
d_counseling_anis_12_3,"How about you, Commander? Do you help others, or ignore them?"
d_counseling_anis_12_4,I can't ignore someone that is in trouble.
d_counseling_anis_12_5,You should solve your own problems.
d_counseling_anis_12_6,"That's such a ""you"" answer."
d_counseling_anis_12_7,"I suppose that's how most people are actually. No matter how much the world has changed, that human connection still remains..."
d_counseling_anis_12_8,Sigh...
d_counseling_anis_12_9,"I guess it doesn't matter all that much, since I'm not human."
d_counseling_anis_12_10,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_anis_12_11,"In the end, you're the only one who can solve your own issues."
d_counseling_anis_12_12,So you might be better off not giving or receiving any help.
d_counseling_anis_12_13,"Still, that's an unexpected answer from you, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_12_14,Anis and I converse about humanity.
d_counseling_anis_13_1,"Do you know how Neon, the spy who's obsessed with firepower, wears glasses?"
d_counseling_anis_13_2,"Since she's a Nikke, couldn't she just swap out her eyeballs?"
d_counseling_anis_13_3,Why does she bother wearing glasses?
d_counseling_anis_13_4,"They don't serve any purpose, and it seems like they'd be uncomfortable."
d_counseling_anis_13_5,Don't you ever put down her glasses!
d_counseling_anis_13_6,I'm not so sure myself.
d_counseling_anis_13_7,"Yikes, you surprised me!"
d_counseling_anis_13_8,Why are you yelling all of a sudden?
d_counseling_anis_13_9,"Wait a minute, you're actually being serious."
d_counseling_anis_13_10,"I didn't expect much, but still...what a boring answer."
d_counseling_anis_13_11,I should just ask her next time.
d_counseling_anis_13_12,...Nevermind. There's no point in prodding any further.
d_counseling_anis_13_13,Anis and I talk about vision.
d_counseling_anis_14_1,"You know Splendamin, the food we're always stuffing down?"
d_counseling_anis_14_2,"For a supposed ""wonderfood"", its name is so bland."
d_counseling_anis_14_3,It might be better if it had a more mouth-watering name.
d_counseling_anis_14_4,Juicy Perfecto.
d_counseling_anis_14_5,Ultra Splendamin.
d_counseling_anis_14_6,"That's... a little better, maybe?"
d_counseling_anis_14_7,... I think it still needs some work.
d_counseling_anis_14_8,"Still, I appreciate you giving it some thought."
d_counseling_anis_14_9,Sounds like some kind of supplement.
d_counseling_anis_14_10,Folkwang will probably go gaga over it.
d_counseling_anis_14_11,Anis and I talk about the profound effect naming can have.
d_counseling_anis_15_1,"When we deal with others, we're always putting on different masks to suit different people."
d_counseling_anis_15_2,...
d_counseling_anis_15_3,"If we were to show them our true colors, would they be averse to it?"
d_counseling_anis_15_4,"If you're gonna put on a mask, might as well wear a cool Ark Rangers mask."
d_counseling_anis_15_5,You can't please everyone. Haters gonna hate.
d_counseling_anis_15_6,...
d_counseling_anis_15_7,I shouldn't have brought this up.
d_counseling_anis_15_8,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_anis_15_9,It's impossible to be loved by everyone.
d_counseling_anis_15_10,"... I tried, but it didn't work out."
d_counseling_anis_15_11,Anis and I have a long conversation about masks.
d_counseling_anis_16_1,"I feel weird saying this,"
d_counseling_anis_16_2,but I find the heat of battle kind of thrilling.
d_counseling_anis_16_3,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I may be a warmonger of some kind."
d_counseling_anis_16_4,What's so surprising about that?
d_counseling_anis_16_5,Your body is tricking your brain in order to survive.
d_counseling_anis_16_6,What? You see me as belligerent?
d_counseling_anis_16_7,"Really? Haha, stop kidding around."
d_counseling_anis_16_8,...
d_counseling_anis_16_9,... Are you serious?
d_counseling_anis_16_10,Right... adrenaline and all that.
d_counseling_anis_16_11,That must be the reason.
d_counseling_anis_16_12,"It can't be just because I enjoy smashing things up, right?"
d_counseling_anis_16_13,Anis and I discuss one's mental fortitude during battle.
d_counseling_anis_17_1,"This is a bit random, but does it bother you"
d_counseling_anis_17_2,that I use your shower whenever I want?
d_counseling_anis_17_3,"Having a girl shower in your room must make you a bit uneasy, right?"
d_counseling_anis_17_4,Uh...
d_counseling_anis_17_5,It really doesn't affect me that much.
d_counseling_anis_17_6,Your eyes are starting to wander off...
d_counseling_anis_17_7,What's going on in that head of yours?!
d_counseling_anis_17_8,You look like you're reminiscing about something euphoric! Cut it out!
d_counseling_anis_17_9,...
d_counseling_anis_17_10,I guess it's nothing.
d_counseling_anis_17_11,Good to hear.
d_counseling_anis_17_12,Anis and I talk about shower supplies.
d_counseling_anis_18_1,How are things going with Rapi?
d_counseling_anis_18_2,"If you're going through a rough patch, just let me know. I can help."
d_counseling_anis_18_3,She can be a bit... fastidious.
d_counseling_anis_18_4,I'll try to figure it out myself.
d_counseling_anis_18_5,"Rapi? No way, she's just thorough!"
d_counseling_anis_18_6,As long as you do what you're supposed to be doing...
d_counseling_anis_18_7,"Hmm... I said I'd help, but all I'm doing is defending her..."
d_counseling_anis_18_8,So you're having a tough time dealing with her?
d_counseling_anis_18_9,"No worries, I'm sure you'll be able to move past it. It's you after all."
d_counseling_anis_18_10,"Rapi is very accommodating so if anything is ever bothering you, don't hide it."
d_counseling_anis_18_11,Anis and I talk more about Rapi.
d_counseling_anis_19_1,Do you like dogs?
d_counseling_anis_19_2,"A long time ago, I met a dog. It must have liked me since it bounded right up to me."
d_counseling_anis_19_3,"It was the first time I had ever seen that dog, yet it made a beeline straight for me..."
d_counseling_anis_19_4,You must have felt uncomfortable.
d_counseling_anis_19_5,You must have been happy.
d_counseling_anis_19_6,Yes. I didn't really like it.
d_counseling_anis_19_7,I knew it didn't mean any harm. It just liked me is all.
d_counseling_anis_19_8,"But nevertheless, it did make me feel uncomfortable."
d_counseling_anis_19_9,I suppose it's just hard to accept such blind affection.
d_counseling_anis_19_10,Hm... Well...
d_counseling_anis_19_11,"I suppose so, but..."
d_counseling_anis_19_12,It made me question why it was so fond of me.
d_counseling_anis_19_13,I didn't like how it just threw caution to the wind and ran right over to me.
d_counseling_anis_19_14,Anis and I talk about animals.
d_counseling_anis_20_1,"If the world was ending tomorrow,"
d_counseling_anis_20_2,what would you want to do?
d_counseling_anis_20_3,I would complete my bucket list.
d_counseling_anis_20_4,I would just sit back and do nothing.
d_counseling_anis_20_5,You've got a bucket list?
d_counseling_anis_20_6,I envy you. I don't have anything like that.
d_counseling_anis_20_7,I think I'd just sit around and take it easy.
d_counseling_anis_20_8,Same here.
d_counseling_anis_20_9,"I don't have many purposes in life anyway, so I can't pretend to suddenly have some out of the blue."
d_counseling_anis_20_10,I'd just go about my usual routine and quietly wait for the end.
d_counseling_anis_20_11,It... feels nicer knowing that I'm not alone.
d_counseling_anis_20_12,Anis and I watched a TV show about possible apocalyptic scenarios.
d_counseling_belorta_01_1,Old-Timer!
d_counseling_belorta_01_2,"Who do you like better, me or Mica?"
d_counseling_belorta_01_3,You.
d_counseling_belorta_01_4,Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_01_5,Me? Really?
d_counseling_belorta_01_6,"In that case, you're not allowed to get mad at me when I play tricks on Mica!"
d_counseling_belorta_01_7,"Oh, who am I kidding? You never do, anyway! Tee-hee!"
d_counseling_belorta_01_8,"Huh, really?"
d_counseling_belorta_01_9,Since Old-Timer has a soft spot for Mica...
d_counseling_belorta_01_10,"You're willing to let me play pranks on you instead of her, right?"
d_counseling_belorta_01_11,"It'll be loads of fun, I promise! Tee-hee!"
d_counseling_belorta_01_12,"I try to appease Belorta, who is way too excited about her trick ideas."
d_counseling_belorta_02_1,Old-Timer! I think I'm in trouble!
d_counseling_belorta_02_2,I have no idea which one to eat first! Should I eat the apple-flavored Splendamin...
d_counseling_belorta_02_3,or the strawberry-flavored Splendamin?
d_counseling_belorta_02_4,"Which one would you choose, Old-Timer?"
d_counseling_belorta_02_5,Apple.
d_counseling_belorta_02_6,Strawberry.
d_counseling_belorta_02_7,What a coincidence!
d_counseling_belorta_02_8,"I must have read your mind, because that's the one I'm already eating!"
d_counseling_belorta_02_9,Strawberry? Didn't expect that.
d_counseling_belorta_02_10,Boo-hoo! I thought for sure you'd choose apple. That's why I went ahead and ate it all up!
d_counseling_belorta_02_11,I buy some more Splendamin and share with Belorta.
d_counseling_belorta_03_1,I want to show off our firecrackers for Neon.
d_counseling_belorta_03_2,What kind of firecracker you think is better?
d_counseling_belorta_03_3,"Big, powerful ones?"
d_counseling_belorta_03_4,Or those pretty ones that the Carronades like so much?
d_counseling_belorta_03_5,Big ones?
d_counseling_belorta_03_6,All our firecrackers go off with big BOOM!
d_counseling_belorta_03_7,"You don't seem to know much about our firecrackers, huh?"
d_counseling_belorta_03_8,Yeah! Obviously we have to choose the gorgeous ones!
d_counseling_belorta_03_9,They are the pride of the Carronades!
d_counseling_belorta_03_10,"Old-Timer, you know us well!"
d_counseling_belorta_03_11,Belorta tells me quite a lot about the Carronades' firecrackers.
d_counseling_belorta_04_1,I haven't seen Mica this angry in a long time!
d_counseling_belorta_04_2,I should do something to put a smile back on her face. But what?
d_counseling_belorta_04_3,Buy her something yummy.
d_counseling_belorta_04_4,"Stop playing tricks on her, just for one day."
d_counseling_belorta_04_5,Something yummy?
d_counseling_belorta_04_6,"Hmm... Generally, I don't share my food with others."
d_counseling_belorta_04_7,"But, then again,
Mica is a special person to me."
d_counseling_belorta_04_8,"So, Old-Timer,"
d_counseling_belorta_04_9,"let's all go out for a great meal together, shall we?"
d_counseling_belorta_04_10,How could you say that?!
d_counseling_belorta_04_11,A day without playing tricks? Impossible!
d_counseling_belorta_04_12,Forget it. I'll just treat her to a great meal.
d_counseling_belorta_04_13,I talk with Belorta about Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_05_1,"Heeey, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_belorta_05_2,I want to give Mica a good scare.
d_counseling_belorta_05_3,"Should I dress up as a ghost,"
d_counseling_belorta_05_4,or as a Rapture?
d_counseling_belorta_05_5,How about a Rapture ghost?
d_counseling_belorta_05_6,Neither one is very scary.
d_counseling_belorta_05_7,A Rapture ghost?
d_counseling_belorta_05_8,Hmm... Mica isn't afraid of ghosts or Raptures on their own.
d_counseling_belorta_05_9,"Great idea, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_belorta_05_10,"Oh, you're saying that Mica won't be afraid of either of them?"
d_counseling_belorta_05_11,"Good job! You can join my tricks on Mica in the future, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_belorta_05_12,Belorta and I come up with an idea that is sure to scare Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_06_1,"Nobody ever comes to our Toy Store. I'm so bored, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_belorta_06_2,Maybe holding an interesting event could bring in more people.
d_counseling_belorta_06_3,What kind of events should we hold?
d_counseling_belorta_06_4,A two-for-one offer on toys?
d_counseling_belorta_06_5,A two-for-one offer on tricks?
d_counseling_belorta_06_6,No! That's too boring!
d_counseling_belorta_06_7,Come up with something funnier!
d_counseling_belorta_06_8,!!
d_counseling_belorta_06_9,"You're a genius, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_belorta_06_10,"One trick on the way in, and another on the way out!"
d_counseling_belorta_06_11,Yeah! This is gonna be great!
d_counseling_belorta_06_12,Belorta and I make a plan to revitalize the Toy Store.
d_counseling_belorta_07_1,"You're always so busy, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_belorta_07_2,What do you even do on the holidays?
d_counseling_belorta_07_3,Rest at home.
d_counseling_belorta_07_4,Head out and have some fun.
d_counseling_belorta_07_5,Come on! Seriously?
d_counseling_belorta_07_6,Staying at home is SO boring.
d_counseling_belorta_07_7,Let's have some fun together!
d_counseling_belorta_07_8,I knew it! I knew you were the outdoorsy type!
d_counseling_belorta_07_9,Woo-hoo!
d_counseling_belorta_07_10,"Next time you have time off, let's go out and play together! Pinky swear!"
d_counseling_belorta_07_11,I have a great time with Belorta while making holiday plans.
d_counseling_belorta_08_1,"Hey, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_belorta_08_2,I have a question for you.
d_counseling_belorta_08_3,If you had the choice between getting eternal life but always being hungry...
d_counseling_belorta_08_4,"and a place where you are not hungry but can only live for a while,"
d_counseling_belorta_08_5,What would you choose?
d_counseling_belorta_08_6,A short life with no hunger.
d_counseling_belorta_08_7,"An eternal, hungry life."
d_counseling_belorta_08_8,"Aha! We're the same, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_belorta_08_9,"The most important thing in life is not to suffer from hunger, right?"
d_counseling_belorta_08_10,What? Really?
d_counseling_belorta_08_11,I thought you would make the same choice I did.
d_counseling_belorta_08_12,Belorta tells me many horrible stories about hunger.
d_counseling_belorta_09_1,"So, what's your favorite meal?"
d_counseling_belorta_09_2,"Breakfast, lunch, or dinner?"
d_counseling_belorta_09_3,"The important thing is what you eat, not when you eat."
d_counseling_belorta_09_4,I like every meal.
d_counseling_belorta_09_5,Whoa! I never thought about it that way.
d_counseling_belorta_09_6,What a brilliant idea!
d_counseling_belorta_09_7,"No matter what time I eat, I'm always happy!"
d_counseling_belorta_09_8,"I feel the same way. I was kind of hoping for a new answer, though."
d_counseling_belorta_09_9,"Anyway, it's great that we're on the same page!"
d_counseling_belorta_09_10,I have a nice and lively discussion with Belorta about food.
d_counseling_belorta_10_1,Old-Timer!
d_counseling_belorta_10_2,They say the weather is gonna be beautiful tomorrow! What kind of things should I do?
d_counseling_belorta_10_3,Light up some firecrackers with Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_10_4,Play tricks on Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_10_5,Tomorrow morning?
d_counseling_belorta_10_6,Hmm... Firecrackers may be fun at any time of day...
d_counseling_belorta_10_7,"But they look better at night. So, I'll wait until nighttime, then light up the sky!"
d_counseling_belorta_10_8,"You got me, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_belorta_10_9,"I was already planning to ""play"" with Mica tomorrow morning!"
d_counseling_belorta_10_10,I chat with Belorta for a while and look forward to a nice day tomorrow.
d_counseling_belorta_11_1,Old-Timer!
d_counseling_belorta_11_2,"If you could take just one thing to a deserted island,"
d_counseling_belorta_11_3,what would it be?
d_counseling_belorta_11_4,"Sustenance is paramount, so large quantities of canned food."
d_counseling_belorta_11_5,"I can't stand being bored, so probably a cellphone or laptop."
d_counseling_belorta_11_6,You put eating above all else as well?
d_counseling_belorta_11_7,You and I think alike!
d_counseling_belorta_11_8,But what would happen when you got hungry?
d_counseling_belorta_11_9,You can't eat a laptop...
d_counseling_belorta_11_10,Belorta and I talk about our desert island survival strategies.
d_counseling_belorta_12_1,"Hey, how do you relieve stress?"
d_counseling_belorta_12_2,Eating something delicious.
d_counseling_belorta_12_3,I meditate.
d_counseling_belorta_12_4,Too right!
d_counseling_belorta_12_5,Eating is the ultimate stress reliever.
d_counseling_belorta_12_6,"Whenever you're starting to feel the pressure, give me a call."
d_counseling_belorta_12_7,We can go hog wild on some delicious grub together!
d_counseling_belorta_12_8,Sounds kinda boring...
d_counseling_belorta_12_9,I feel like it'd only add more stress on top of how you're already feeling.
d_counseling_belorta_12_10,Belorta and I talk about ways to relieve stress.
d_counseling_belorta_13_1,Old-Timer!
d_counseling_belorta_13_2,Do you prefer night or day?
d_counseling_belorta_13_3,Day.
d_counseling_belorta_13_4,Night.
d_counseling_belorta_13_5,"Daytime can be nice, but"
d_counseling_belorta_13_6,"I prefer nighttime, because that's when you can set off fireworks!"
d_counseling_belorta_13_7,Great minds think alike!
d_counseling_belorta_13_8,I prefer nighttime as well.
d_counseling_belorta_13_9,That's when you can set off fireworks!
d_counseling_belorta_13_10,Belorta and I discuss the pros and cons of day and night.
d_counseling_belorta_14_1,Are there any foods that you dislike?
d_counseling_belorta_14_2,No.
d_counseling_belorta_14_3,I'm not big on vegetables.
d_counseling_belorta_14_4,"Yep, you're a foodie just like me."
d_counseling_belorta_14_5,"It doesn't matter what it is, it all tastes great to us."
d_counseling_belorta_14_6,"Two human garbage disposals, that's what we are!"
d_counseling_belorta_14_7,I was surprised to hear that you're a bit of a picky eater.
d_counseling_belorta_14_8,Vegetables can be delicious if you give them a chance!
d_counseling_belorta_14_9,Belorta and I talk about food.
d_counseling_belorta_15_1,Food that you've cooked yourself
d_counseling_belorta_15_2,always tastes better. I wonder why...
d_counseling_belorta_15_3,"Are you a good cook, Old-Timer?"
d_counseling_belorta_15_4,Cooking is a hobby for me.
d_counseling_belorta_15_5,I can barely boil water.
d_counseling_belorta_15_6,All right! You should cook up something special for me then!
d_counseling_belorta_15_7,My own personal chef!
d_counseling_belorta_15_8,I can't wait to see what you make me.
d_counseling_belorta_15_9,That makes two of us.
d_counseling_belorta_15_10,How about you and I learn together?
d_counseling_belorta_15_11,Belorta and I searched for mouth-watering recipes.
d_counseling_belorta_16_1,Old-Timer! Old-Timer!
d_counseling_belorta_16_2,Mint chocolate is all the rage these days.
d_counseling_belorta_16_3,Do you like it?
d_counseling_belorta_16_4,I'm a mint chocolate fanatic.
d_counseling_belorta_16_5,I'm not a huge fan.
d_counseling_belorta_16_6,"I knew you'd say that. You're just like me, there's nothing you dislike!"
d_counseling_belorta_16_7,Mica and I had some mint chocolate ice cream.
d_counseling_belorta_16_8,It was absolutely delicious.
d_counseling_belorta_16_9,What?! No way!
d_counseling_belorta_16_10,There's nothing better than mint chocolate ice cream!
d_counseling_belorta_16_11,Belorta and I have a conversation about mint chocolate.
d_counseling_belorta_17_1,What are you in the mood for?
d_counseling_belorta_17_2,Setting off fireworks together.
d_counseling_belorta_17_3,Having a nice meal together.
d_counseling_belorta_17_4,"Hehehe, I was thinking that as well."
d_counseling_belorta_17_5,We're gonna have a blast!
d_counseling_belorta_17_6,I'm gonna show you some incredible fireworks.
d_counseling_belorta_17_7,"I'd love to, but I just ate."
d_counseling_belorta_17_8,Although I could eat more if I put my mind to it.
d_counseling_belorta_17_9,How about we watch some fireworks while I let everything digest?
d_counseling_belorta_17_10,Belorta and I figure out which fireworks to set off.
d_counseling_belorta_18_1,"Hey, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_belorta_18_2,I'm thinking of creating a bucket list.
d_counseling_belorta_18_3,What's on yours?
d_counseling_belorta_18_4,To try new foods all around the world.
d_counseling_belorta_18_5,Travel the world after reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_belorta_18_6,"Oh my gosh, just thinking about that gets me pumped!"
d_counseling_belorta_18_7,I'm going to add that too.
d_counseling_belorta_18_8,We can go on a culinary world tour together!
d_counseling_belorta_18_9,Hmm... I'm not super interested in travel.
d_counseling_belorta_18_10,"Unless it's traveling to eat, that is!"
d_counseling_belorta_18_11,Belorta and I compare and contrast our bucket lists.
d_counseling_belorta_19_1,Mica and I came up with nicknames for each other today.
d_counseling_belorta_19_2,"If you were to give the two of us a nickname,"
d_counseling_belorta_19_3,what would you call us?
d_counseling_belorta_19_4,Baby pig sisters.
d_counseling_belorta_19_5,Firecrackers
d_counseling_belorta_19_6,"Hmmm... I may be a baby pig, but Mica isn't..."
d_counseling_belorta_19_7,I'll ask Mica!
d_counseling_belorta_19_8,Not bad!
d_counseling_belorta_19_9,That fits Mica and me to a T!
d_counseling_belorta_19_10,I've got to go tell Mica!
d_counseling_belorta_19_11,Belorta and I spend time coming up with more nicknames.
d_counseling_belorta_20_1,Can I ask you a question?
d_counseling_belorta_20_2,How would you feel if your close friend died?
d_counseling_belorta_20_3,Mica will always be with you.
d_counseling_belorta_20_4,I would feel as if a part of me died as well.
d_counseling_belorta_20_5,I certainly hope so.
d_counseling_belorta_20_6,I'd be bored stiff without Mica.
d_counseling_belorta_20_7,I'm gonna go hang out with her today.
d_counseling_belorta_20_8,I don't think that would make Mica very happy...
d_counseling_belorta_20_9,I'd rather not think about it.
d_counseling_belorta_20_10,Belorta and I have a conversation about death.
d_counseling_brid_01_1,A word of advice.
d_counseling_brid_01_2,"If Soline comes over and nags you to do something,"
d_counseling_brid_01_3,please refuse all her requests.
d_counseling_brid_01_4,She relies on others too much. It's a bad habit.
d_counseling_brid_01_5,Ignoring her won't fix that.
d_counseling_brid_01_6,"If I ignore her, she'll keep nagging."
d_counseling_brid_01_7,*Sigh* That's true.
d_counseling_brid_01_8,"It must be difficult for you, Commander."
d_counseling_brid_01_9,"If that happens, please notify me."
d_counseling_brid_01_10,I will make myself of assistance.
d_counseling_brid_01_11,Brid and I sigh while thinking of Soline.
d_counseling_brid_02_1,*Sigh*
d_counseling_brid_02_2,What even is this schedule?
d_counseling_brid_02_3,Who made this?
d_counseling_brid_02_4,Bring her a coffee without saying anything.
d_counseling_brid_02_5,Is something the matter?
d_counseling_brid_02_6,Ah... Coffee.
d_counseling_brid_02_7,Just what I needed to keep me sharp.
d_counseling_brid_02_8,Thank you.
d_counseling_brid_02_9,"Ah. I must look so tired, don't I?"
d_counseling_brid_02_10,Forgive me.
d_counseling_brid_02_11,It's not a big deal. You don't have to worry about me.
d_counseling_brid_02_12,"I work alongside Brid, who has a lot on her plate."
d_counseling_brid_03_1,"Commander, I want to ask you something."
d_counseling_brid_03_2,Do you prefer your coffee bitter?
d_counseling_brid_03_3,Or do you prefer a nutty flavor?
d_counseling_brid_03_4,Bitter.
d_counseling_brid_03_5,Nutty.
d_counseling_brid_03_6,I see.
d_counseling_brid_03_7,I wanted to give you some of the coffee I bought today...
d_counseling_brid_03_8,"But, I'm afraid you won't like it."
d_counseling_brid_03_9,I'm glad to hear that.
d_counseling_brid_03_10,I want to share the coffee I bought today with you.
d_counseling_brid_03_11,I think you'll enjoy it.
d_counseling_brid_03_12,I spend time with Brid while drinking coffee.
d_counseling_brid_04_1,Did you know that Diesel likes to sing?
d_counseling_brid_04_2,Passengers occasionally report that some tone-deaf woman is bombarding them with noise.
d_counseling_brid_04_3,I believe it must be Diesel.
d_counseling_brid_04_4,What can I do to discourage Diesel from singing without offending her?
d_counseling_brid_04_5,Tell her to stop her awful singing.
d_counseling_brid_04_6,Tell her to fill her mouth with candy during her shift.
d_counseling_brid_04_7,I'm not sure if saying that won't hurt her feelings.
d_counseling_brid_04_8,*Sigh* But perhaps there's no other choice.
d_counseling_brid_04_9,I will try to speak to her sincerely.
d_counseling_brid_04_10,That's a great idea.
d_counseling_brid_04_11,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_brid_04_12,Brid and I remain concerned about Diesel's singing.
d_counseling_brid_05_1,"I have noted that you occasionally use our train service, Commander."
d_counseling_brid_05_2,Have you experienced any inconveniences?
d_counseling_brid_05_3,"A few days ago, Soline was sitting beside me and grumbling."
d_counseling_brid_05_4,"No, none at all."
d_counseling_brid_05_5,It seems that kind of thing is bound to happen.
d_counseling_brid_05_6,Thank you for your feedback.
d_counseling_brid_05_7,There must be something.
d_counseling_brid_05_8,This is for improving the service of the Ark Express.
d_counseling_brid_05_9,We are not trying to get anyone in trouble.
d_counseling_brid_05_10,"So, you don't need to cover for anyone."
d_counseling_brid_05_11,I discuss with Brid how to improve the service of the Ark Express.
d_counseling_brid_06_1,Someone was saying that
d_counseling_brid_06_2,the AZX is still far from completion.
d_counseling_brid_06_3,"Do you agree, Commander?"
d_counseling_brid_06_4,Yes. There's plenty of room for improvement.
d_counseling_brid_06_5,No. I believe it is perfect as it is.
d_counseling_brid_06_6,Hm. I know you are trying to be diplomatic...
d_counseling_brid_06_7,"But the fact is, you see it as incomplete."
d_counseling_brid_06_8,I see your point.
d_counseling_brid_06_9,Although I know clearly that she is still incomplete...
d_counseling_brid_06_10,... I'm still glad to hear you say that.
d_counseling_brid_06_11,I have a conversation with Brid about the good points of the AZX.
d_counseling_brid_07_1,"Commander, when you have a lot of things to do,"
d_counseling_brid_07_2,do you do it all at once and then relax?
d_counseling_brid_07_3,Or do you alternate between work and breaks to keep things in balance?
d_counseling_brid_07_4,I do it all at once.
d_counseling_brid_07_5,I try to balance it out.
d_counseling_brid_07_6,"I see. So, you are just like me."
d_counseling_brid_07_7,"You never know what else will come up, so I prefer finishing everything at once."
d_counseling_brid_07_8,"Judging by the way you work with Counters,"
d_counseling_brid_07_9,I didn't think you were the type to seek balance.
d_counseling_brid_07_10,Your answer is very unexpected.
d_counseling_brid_07_11,I have a conversation with Brid about how difficult it is to be a burned-out office worker.
d_counseling_brid_08_1,Nice weather today.
d_counseling_brid_08_2,"Are you working today, or will you be going out to have some fun?"
d_counseling_brid_08_3,"Do I have other options, aside from work?"
d_counseling_brid_08_4,I'm going out to have fun.
d_counseling_brid_08_5,You understand your situation well.
d_counseling_brid_08_6,A commander's work never ends.
d_counseling_brid_08_7,Keep it up.
d_counseling_brid_08_8,You have many tasks that need to be completed today.
d_counseling_brid_08_9,You really think you can just put them off?
d_counseling_brid_08_10,I work hard with Brid.
d_counseling_brid_09_1,"Sometimes,"
d_counseling_brid_09_2,I regret handing over the leadership role to Diesel.
d_counseling_brid_09_3,I turned down the job because I didn't think I could lead the squad.
d_counseling_brid_09_4,Now I wonder if I have given her too heavy a burden.
d_counseling_brid_09_5,It does seem pretty hard on her.
d_counseling_brid_09_6,Diesel is a strong leader.
d_counseling_brid_09_7,Uh... That's not it. Diesel is an extraordinary leader.
d_counseling_brid_09_8,I'm sorry for not being clear.
d_counseling_brid_09_9,I feel sorry for Diesel.
d_counseling_brid_09_10,That's correct.
d_counseling_brid_09_11,Diesel is a strong leader.
d_counseling_brid_09_12,"If I keep worrying like this, others will doubt her ability."
d_counseling_brid_09_13,Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_brid_09_14,I have a conversation with Brid about Diesel's leadership.
d_counseling_brid_10_1,It appears the number of passengers using the Ark Express has significantly increased recently.
d_counseling_brid_10_2,"Of course, this is a good sign for us."
d_counseling_brid_10_3,"But, I'm curious why this happened. There haven't been any special events."
d_counseling_brid_10_4,"Commander, perhaps you know the reason?"
d_counseling_brid_10_5,Brid is becoming more and more popular.
d_counseling_brid_10_6,The AZX is becoming more and more popular.
d_counseling_brid_10_7,...
d_counseling_brid_10_8,I'm asking you seriously.
d_counseling_brid_10_9,Do I sound like I'm joking?
d_counseling_brid_10_10,Fine. I withdraw the question.
d_counseling_brid_10_11,Great minds think alike.
d_counseling_brid_10_12,"I believe that's the reason, too."
d_counseling_brid_10_13,Thank you for confirming it.
d_counseling_brid_10_14,I spend some quality time with Brid.
d_counseling_brid_11_1,"If you had a time machine,"
d_counseling_brid_11_2,"would you want to go to the past,"
d_counseling_brid_11_3,or the future?
d_counseling_brid_11_4,The past.
d_counseling_brid_11_5,The future.
d_counseling_brid_11_6,So would I.
d_counseling_brid_11_7,"I'd want to go back to the day of the AFX Incident,"
d_counseling_brid_11_8,time paradoxes be darned.
d_counseling_brid_11_9,I figured as much.
d_counseling_brid_11_10,"You'd prefer to see the future, not relive the past."
d_counseling_brid_11_11,That's probably the more normal choice...
d_counseling_brid_11_12,Brid and I fantasized more about time machines.
d_counseling_brid_12_1,"When you're working, do you prefer talking face-to-face,"
d_counseling_brid_12_2,or through text messages?
d_counseling_brid_12_3,Face-to-face.
d_counseling_brid_12_4,Text messages.
d_counseling_brid_12_5,I see...
d_counseling_brid_12_6,Using text messages for work conversations can be good because it cuts out any extraneous small talk.
d_counseling_brid_12_7,It's also easier to prevent things from slipping through the cracks.
d_counseling_brid_12_8,But I can still respect your way of going about things.
d_counseling_brid_12_9,I feel the same.
d_counseling_brid_12_10,I think it's more efficient
d_counseling_brid_12_11,at preventing things from slipping through the cracks.
d_counseling_brid_12_12,Brid and I have a conversation about our working styles.
d_counseling_brid_13_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_brid_13_2,"when you look at me, what do you see?"
d_counseling_brid_13_3,A coffee addict.
d_counseling_brid_13_4,A workaholic.
d_counseling_brid_13_5,A coffee addict?
d_counseling_brid_13_6,Don't be ridiculous.
d_counseling_brid_13_7,8 cups a day is perfectly acceptable for the average worker.
d_counseling_brid_13_8,...
d_counseling_brid_13_9,"I already knew it,"
d_counseling_brid_13_10,but it's different hearing it back from someone else.
d_counseling_brid_13_11,"Regardless, it seems to be an accurate assessment. Thank you."
d_counseling_brid_13_12,I speak to Brid further about her habits and her personality.
d_counseling_brid_14_1,Commander.
d_counseling_brid_14_2,Don't you have something to say to me?
d_counseling_brid_14_3,Did you finish all your work?
d_counseling_brid_14_4,I'm sorry?
d_counseling_brid_14_5,"Yes, of course I did..."
d_counseling_brid_14_6,Ah!
d_counseling_brid_14_7,I forgot to receive a report from Soline.
d_counseling_brid_14_8,"In fact, I was going to remind you that last time you asked me the time of the train I was driving."
d_counseling_brid_14_9,"But instead, it reminded me of the unfinished work."
d_counseling_brid_14_10,Why are you apologizing?
d_counseling_brid_14_11,"In fact, I was going to remind you that last time you asked me the time of the train I was driving."
d_counseling_brid_14_12,But now I'm starting to wonder what you've done wrong.
d_counseling_brid_14_13,I have a conversation with Brid.
d_counseling_brid_15_1,"If you had a day off,"
d_counseling_brid_15_2,what would you want to do?
d_counseling_brid_15_3,Sleep in all day.
d_counseling_brid_15_4,Day off? There is no such thing.
d_counseling_brid_15_5,You should make the most of your days off.
d_counseling_brid_15_6,"You can sleep in anytime,"
d_counseling_brid_15_7,so it's a waste to sleep the entire day away.
d_counseling_brid_15_8,"Nevertheless, I will respect your opinion."
d_counseling_brid_15_9,!!
d_counseling_brid_15_10,So true.
d_counseling_brid_15_11,Keep at it.
d_counseling_brid_15_12,Brid and I have a conversation about days off.
d_counseling_brid_16_1,Is there anyone you're having difficulty working with?
d_counseling_brid_16_2,No one comes to mind.
d_counseling_brid_16_3,There is someone who's a bit childish.
d_counseling_brid_16_4,That's great that you get along with everyone so well.
d_counseling_brid_16_5,"But then again,"
d_counseling_brid_16_6,"if you're going to lead all of these Nikkes,"
d_counseling_brid_16_7,that's to be expected.
d_counseling_brid_16_8,!!
d_counseling_brid_16_9,I thought you of all people wouldn't find Soline difficult...
d_counseling_brid_16_10,But I can certainly understand your feelings.
d_counseling_brid_16_11,I have a conversation with Brid about her co-workers.
d_counseling_brid_17_1,Someone once told me that
d_counseling_brid_17_2,lying isn't always a bad thing...
d_counseling_brid_17_3,Do you believe there's such a thing as a white lie?
d_counseling_brid_17_4,I do.
d_counseling_brid_17_5,"No, I don't."
d_counseling_brid_17_6,So that's how you feel...
d_counseling_brid_17_7,...
d_counseling_brid_17_8,I'm sorry.
d_counseling_brid_17_9,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_brid_17_10,The worst truth is still better than the best lie.
d_counseling_brid_17_11,"No matter how much pain it could cause me,"
d_counseling_brid_17_12,I would always prefer to hear the most devastating truth over any lie.
d_counseling_brid_17_13,Brid and I talk more about the idea of lying.
d_counseling_brid_18_1,"A few days ago, I heard that Talentum Mall has new investment products."
d_counseling_brid_18_2,"They claimed it could drastically increase any Nikke's salary, and asked whether I was interested."
d_counseling_brid_18_3,"Commander, do you tend to jump at new challenges that present themselves?"
d_counseling_brid_18_4,Or do you prefer to play it safe and not risk it?
d_counseling_brid_18_5,I often take on challenges.
d_counseling_brid_18_6,I prefer to play it safe.
d_counseling_brid_18_7,I thought so.
d_counseling_brid_18_8,That's why you're always heading up to the surface even when reclaiming it is by no means a certainty.
d_counseling_brid_18_9,"But taking on too many challenges could cause you to lose everything,"
d_counseling_brid_18_10,so I hope you don't overexert yourself and end up worse off for it.
d_counseling_brid_18_11,That's surprising. I thought it would be the other way around.
d_counseling_brid_18_12,"To be honest, I tend to play things safe as well."
d_counseling_brid_18_13,"For me, the risk of losing everything I have"
d_counseling_brid_18_14,is not worth any potential profits I could gain from going out on a limb.
d_counseling_brid_18_15,Brid and I talk a little more about taking on new challenges.
d_counseling_brid_19_1,Passengers often tell me that
d_counseling_brid_19_2,trains are a very romantic way of traveling.
d_counseling_brid_19_3,How do you feel about trains?
d_counseling_brid_19_4,I don't have time for such flights of fancy.
d_counseling_brid_19_5,I long for the day I can ride the rails up on the surface.
d_counseling_brid_19_6,Same here.
d_counseling_brid_19_7,There's too much going on in our own reality
d_counseling_brid_19_8,to entertain any dreams of travel right now.
d_counseling_brid_19_9,Traversing the surface on a train certainly sounds like a dream all right.
d_counseling_brid_19_10,...
d_counseling_brid_19_11,A dream that isn't promised.
d_counseling_brid_19_12,"However, if a time like that ever comes"
d_counseling_brid_19_13,I would want to operate that train that you are on.
d_counseling_brid_19_14,Brid and I talk about train travel.
d_counseling_brid_20_1,I feel like time has been flying by so fast lately.
d_counseling_brid_20_2,"Let me ask you,"
d_counseling_brid_20_3,where do you think I will be in 10 years?
d_counseling_brid_20_4,You'll probably be a member of the Ark Express.
d_counseling_brid_20_5,You'll probably still be running the train like you are now.
d_counseling_brid_20_6,"I'm sorry to tell you this, but"
d_counseling_brid_20_7,"as long as I am a Nikke, I'm afraid that's impossible."
d_counseling_brid_20_8,"Yes, I'll be doing just what I'm doing now."
d_counseling_brid_20_9,Thank you.
d_counseling_brid_20_10,"If you ask me, there's no better future than that."
d_counseling_brid_20_11,Brid and I discuss the future.
d_counseling_centi_01_1,"Boss!
Folks at the Outpost are always complaining about the construction noise!"
d_counseling_centi_01_2,But... it's construction! It's gonna be loud no matter what!
d_counseling_centi_01_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_centi_01_4,Give them ear plugs.
d_counseling_centi_01_5,Make it louder!
d_counseling_centi_01_6,No!
d_counseling_centi_01_7,"If they can't hear what's going on, it'd be even more dangerous!"
d_counseling_centi_01_8,"Anyway, thanks for your advice!"
d_counseling_centi_01_9,"Oh! You mean we should speed up the construction, right?"
d_counseling_centi_01_10,"Got it!
I'll try my best!"
d_counseling_centi_01_11,I have a conversation with Centi about construction noise.
d_counseling_centi_02_1,I have a question!
d_counseling_centi_02_2,Does all my noise make you uncomfortable?
d_counseling_centi_02_3,"Actually, it energizes me!"
d_counseling_centi_02_4,It is like a lullaby to me.
d_counseling_centi_02_5,"Really?!
Well, I know I really make a lot of noise."
d_counseling_centi_02_6,"So, I'm glad it gives you energy!"
d_counseling_centi_02_7,Maybe I should talk this loud all the time!!!
d_counseling_centi_02_8,Seriously?!
d_counseling_centi_02_9,I'm afraid you might need to see a doctor!
d_counseling_centi_02_10,I have a conversation with Centi about appropriate chatting volume.
d_counseling_centi_03_1,I'm trying to come up with a new architectural design!
d_counseling_centi_03_2,What do you think? Should design be practical and plain...
d_counseling_centi_03_3,"Or fancy, if a little inconvenient?"
d_counseling_centi_03_4,I just can't make up my mind!
d_counseling_centi_03_5,Why not practical AND fancy?
d_counseling_centi_03_6,"If you can't decide, just build two buildings!"
d_counseling_centi_03_7,No way!
d_counseling_centi_03_8,"If that was a possibility, I wouldn't be in this pickle in the first place!"
d_counseling_centi_03_9,Yeah! You're right!
d_counseling_centi_03_10,I've got the time! I've got the materials!
d_counseling_centi_03_11,I'll just build two!
d_counseling_centi_03_12,I look over some designs with Centi.
d_counseling_centi_04_1,I love building!
d_counseling_centi_04_2,"But, space here is so limited!"
d_counseling_centi_04_3,I'm terrified I'll run out of spots to build on before long!
d_counseling_centi_04_4,We'll take back the surface soon!
d_counseling_centi_04_5,"If that happens, just tear it all down and start over!"
d_counseling_centi_04_6,!!
d_counseling_centi_04_7,"That's the coolest thing you've ever said, Boss!"
d_counseling_centi_04_8,"It may just be big talk, but it still sounds so cool!"
d_counseling_centi_04_9,I would never tear down something I built myself!
d_counseling_centi_04_10,My buildings are like my children!
d_counseling_centi_04_11,I could never do that to them!
d_counseling_centi_04_12,I learn a lot about the building zones from Centi.
d_counseling_centi_05_1,"One time, my hammer broke and we had to stop working for a while!"
d_counseling_centi_05_2,"Because of that delay, we couldn't finish the building according to schedule!"
d_counseling_centi_05_3,"A building schedule is like a promise!
I can't go around breaking my promises!"
d_counseling_centi_05_4,Bad things happen from time to time!
d_counseling_centi_05_5,A good builder does not blame their tools!
d_counseling_centi_05_6,"I didn't come to you for comforting words, Boss!"
d_counseling_centi_05_7,I'm gonna keep working hard and do my best!
d_counseling_centi_05_8,Boss! Are you telling me I'm not good enough?
d_counseling_centi_05_9,...
d_counseling_centi_05_10,"Oh, I got it!
What you meant was: where there's a will, there's a way!"
d_counseling_centi_05_11,"Ok! Next time my hammer breaks, I'll keep hammering with my fists!"
d_counseling_centi_05_12,I discuss the importance of tools with Centi.
d_counseling_centi_06_1,"If I don't eat regularly, I will have no strength to work!"
d_counseling_centi_06_2,"But to eat three meals a day, I have to stop working three times a day!"
d_counseling_centi_06_3,This really bothers me!
d_counseling_centi_06_4,Just eat a day's worth of food at once!
d_counseling_centi_06_5,Just eat and work at the same time!
d_counseling_centi_06_6,Whoa! Good idea!
d_counseling_centi_06_7,I'll try it tomorrow!
d_counseling_centi_06_8,"Better yet, I could eat a whole month's worth of food at once!"
d_counseling_centi_06_9,No! That's dangerous!
d_counseling_centi_06_10,You can't get distracted when you work!
d_counseling_centi_06_11,One wrong step and you'd be in a heap of trouble!
d_counseling_centi_06_12,I have a conversation with Centi about the importance of eating.
d_counseling_centi_07_1,Liter is so small!
d_counseling_centi_07_2,I just want to pat her on her little head!
d_counseling_centi_07_3,But she would kill me if I did!
d_counseling_centi_07_4,Are you afraid of death!?
d_counseling_centi_07_5,Don't worry! She wears a helmet!
d_counseling_centi_07_6,...
d_counseling_centi_07_7,Life is the most important thing in the world.
d_counseling_centi_07_8,Huh! You're right!
d_counseling_centi_07_9,I'll give it a try!
d_counseling_centi_07_10,"Before long, I'm gonna wear a hole in her little helmet!"
d_counseling_centi_07_11,I have a conversation about Liter with Centi.
d_counseling_centi_08_1,"I freaking love vehicles!
 I wanna get one!"
d_counseling_centi_08_2,I just can't decide between a motorcycle or a truck!
d_counseling_centi_08_3,Can you pick one for me?
d_counseling_centi_08_4,A truck!
d_counseling_centi_08_5,A motorcycle!
d_counseling_centi_08_6,"Yeah, Boss! I think you've got the right idea!"
d_counseling_centi_08_7,Just think of all the stuff I could fit in there!
d_counseling_centi_08_8,I wonder why some people just don't seem to appreciate trucks!
d_counseling_centi_08_9,"Really? Come to think of it, motorcycles can't carry very many tools!"
d_counseling_centi_08_10,"I couldn't take Liter with me, either!"
d_counseling_centi_08_11,"So, no motorcycles for me!"
d_counseling_centi_08_12,I talk about driving routes with Centi.
d_counseling_centi_09_1,Safety is important!
d_counseling_centi_09_2,"But, putting safety first means I have to work slower!"
d_counseling_centi_09_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_centi_09_4,Adjust the project schedule!
d_counseling_centi_09_5,"No matter what, safety always comes first!"
d_counseling_centi_09_6,I'll stick to the schedule even if it kills me!
d_counseling_centi_09_7,I will follow it no matter what!
d_counseling_centi_09_8,You're right!
d_counseling_centi_09_9,"It may take longer, but it's the right thing to do!"
d_counseling_centi_09_10,Safety first! Right?
d_counseling_centi_09_11,I have a conversation with Centi about the importance of the project schedule.
d_counseling_centi_10_1,I've been to the Outer Rim!
d_counseling_centi_10_2,"It's no wonderland, let me tell you! The environment is terrible!"
d_counseling_centi_10_3,"I want to help them, but I don't know what to do!"
d_counseling_centi_10_4,Give them moral support!
d_counseling_centi_10_5,Rebuild the whole Outer Rim!
d_counseling_centi_10_6,But that won't improve the environment at all!
d_counseling_centi_10_7,"They need houses and utilities, not encouragement!"
d_counseling_centi_10_8,Copy that!
d_counseling_centi_10_9,It'll take a long time and a whole lot of money!
d_counseling_centi_10_10,"But, I'll get it done someday!"
d_counseling_centi_10_11,Centi tells me more about the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_centi_11_1,I still feel really awkward with Volt!
d_counseling_centi_11_2,I'm struggling to find ways to get close to him!
d_counseling_centi_11_3,Give him lots of treats!
d_counseling_centi_11_4,Take him out for walks every day!
d_counseling_centi_11_5,"If I give him too many treats, I'll be in hot water with Liter!"
d_counseling_centi_11_6,And Volt doesn't eat the treats I give him...
d_counseling_centi_11_7,!!
d_counseling_centi_11_8,That's a good idea!
d_counseling_centi_11_9,I'm going to take him out for a walk tomorrow on Liter's behalf!
d_counseling_centi_11_10,I'll also bring his favorite toys!
d_counseling_centi_11_11,Centi and I look into ways of how she can get closer to Volt.
d_counseling_centi_12_1,"I'm planning on buying a new toolbox,"
d_counseling_centi_12_2,but I'm not sure what color I want to get.
d_counseling_centi_12_3,Orange.
d_counseling_centi_12_4,Grey.
d_counseling_centi_12_5,"I don't know, that might be a bit too garish..."
d_counseling_centi_12_6,I want to try my best to avoid bright colors.
d_counseling_centi_12_7,Nice! That'll complement my clothes perfectly.
d_counseling_centi_12_8,It'll also be harder to see any scuff marks on it.
d_counseling_centi_12_9,It's settled then! Grey it is!
d_counseling_centi_12_10,Centi and I searched for the ideal toolbox.
d_counseling_centi_13_1,I dreamt that Mighty Tools won this year's architectural award.
d_counseling_centi_13_2,"The dream was so vivid, I'm still replaying it in my mind!"
d_counseling_centi_13_3,"That was no dream, that was a vision!"
d_counseling_centi_13_4,Congratulations!
d_counseling_centi_13_5,!!
d_counseling_centi_13_6,No kidding! I hope it comes true.
d_counseling_centi_13_7,"If Liter and I won an award, I'd be over the moon!"
d_counseling_centi_13_8,"It was only a dream, but thanks regardless."
d_counseling_centi_13_9,I just hope it comes true in real life.
d_counseling_centi_13_10,I help Centi prepare an acceptance speech for the awards ceremony.
d_counseling_centi_14_1,It's such a pain working in the rain!
d_counseling_centi_14_2,"I only have two hands, so I can't hold an umbrella."
d_counseling_centi_14_3,Wear a raincoat while you're working.
d_counseling_centi_14_4,Take a break whenever it starts raining.
d_counseling_centi_14_5,That's genius!
d_counseling_centi_14_6,Why didn't I think of that?
d_counseling_centi_14_7,I'll just slip on a raincoat whenever it rains.
d_counseling_centi_14_8,Absolutely not!
d_counseling_centi_14_9,"If I rested every time it rained, I'd be way behind schedule!"
d_counseling_centi_14_10,Centi and I vent about what a hindrance rain can be.
d_counseling_centi_15_1,"Say, do you ever listen to music when you're working?"
d_counseling_centi_15_2,Apparently it's supposed to make you more productive.
d_counseling_centi_15_3,"Soooo, I'm wondering what kind of music I should listen to while I work."
d_counseling_centi_15_4,Crank some hip-hop and hammer along to the beat.
d_counseling_centi_15_5,Blast some rock music to raise the tempo.
d_counseling_centi_15_6,"Oooh, that sounds exciting!"
d_counseling_centi_15_7,"Just me, my body, and the rhythm!"
d_counseling_centi_15_8,"When it comes to construction, it's dangerous to rush things!"
d_counseling_centi_15_9,I'll have to listen to something else.
d_counseling_centi_15_10,Centi and I think about what kind of music she should listen to while working.
d_counseling_centi_16_1,I can't imagine life without Liter.
d_counseling_centi_16_2,I'm worried I'll be useless without her.
d_counseling_centi_16_3,You're perfectly capable of solving problems on your own.
d_counseling_centi_16_4,Don't worry too much about things that haven't even happened yet.
d_counseling_centi_16_5,You think so?
d_counseling_centi_16_6,It's a relief to hear you say that.
d_counseling_centi_16_7,I'll try to improve myself more in the meantime!
d_counseling_centi_16_8,You're right!
d_counseling_centi_16_9,"Liter isn't going anywhere, not for now at least!"
d_counseling_centi_16_10,I just get in my own head too much when I'm alone.
d_counseling_centi_16_11,I have a conversation with Centi about Liter.
d_counseling_centi_17_1,"Boss, what do you normally do during your free time?"
d_counseling_centi_17_2,Anything to improve me.
d_counseling_centi_17_3,Read.
d_counseling_centi_17_4,You too?!
d_counseling_centi_17_5,That's really impressive!
d_counseling_centi_17_6,I study architecture whenever I've got a spare minute.
d_counseling_centi_17_7,"Oh, cool!"
d_counseling_centi_17_8,"I zonk out as soon as I open a book, so I'm no bookworm."
d_counseling_centi_17_9,How do you do it?
d_counseling_centi_17_10,Just the idea of going through an entire book makes me drowsy.
d_counseling_centi_17_11,Centi and I talk about what we do in our spare time.
d_counseling_centi_18_1,"Boss, do you like crowded places?"
d_counseling_centi_18_2,Or do you prefer places with fewer people around?
d_counseling_centi_18_3,Crowded places.
d_counseling_centi_18_4,Empty places.
d_counseling_centi_18_5,You like crowded places too?
d_counseling_centi_18_6,You're the same as me!
d_counseling_centi_18_7,"Whenever I see crowds of people visiting the buildings I've constructed, I feel a sense of pride."
d_counseling_centi_18_8,So you prefer silence over the hustle and bustle?
d_counseling_centi_18_9,I'd be bored out of my gourd if there was no one else around.
d_counseling_centi_18_10,Not to mention that I'd be out of a job!
d_counseling_centi_18_11,Centi and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_centi_19_1,Lifetime job security is a thing of the past.
d_counseling_centi_19_2,The idea that my job might disappear one day really bums me out.
d_counseling_centi_19_3,I'm pretty sure our jobs are safe.
d_counseling_centi_19_4,I'm doing some job hunting on the side myself.
d_counseling_centi_19_5,!!
d_counseling_centi_19_6,You think so?
d_counseling_centi_19_7,That's a relief! I like this job!
d_counseling_centi_19_8,!!
d_counseling_centi_19_9,What?! Why would you do that?
d_counseling_centi_19_10,This is the perfect job for you already!
d_counseling_centi_19_11,Centi and I have a conversation about jobs.
d_counseling_centi_20_1,"Boss, do you believe in superstition?"
d_counseling_centi_20_2,"For me, if my shoelaces are untied before I head out, the rest of the day is all downhill from there."
d_counseling_centi_20_3,There's got to be some way around this...
d_counseling_centi_20_4,Just don't overthink things and keep working.
d_counseling_centi_20_5,Wear shoes without laces.
d_counseling_centi_20_6,"I try not to think about it, but it keeps popping up in my head!"
d_counseling_centi_20_7,I've got to think of a way to get rid of this bad luck!
d_counseling_centi_20_8,!!
d_counseling_centi_20_9,Shoes without laces!
d_counseling_centi_20_10,That's genius! I'll go buy some right now!
d_counseling_centi_20_11,Centi and I talk more about various superstitions.
d_counseling_crow_01_1,I need more weapons.
d_counseling_crow_01_2,Do you know any place that's worth spending my money on?
d_counseling_crow_01_3,"What do you need them for, exactly?"
d_counseling_crow_01_4,Dark Net?
d_counseling_crow_01_5,Did nobody ever tell you that curiosity killed the cat?
d_counseling_crow_01_6,Save yourself a world of trouble and stop asking.
d_counseling_crow_01_7,Huh. Never expected you to recommend that place.
d_counseling_crow_01_8,"Even the most righteous hero will betray the law,"
d_counseling_crow_01_9,when it comes to weapon quality.
d_counseling_crow_01_10,I share a serious conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_02_1,Do you see the bomb attached to my neck?
d_counseling_crow_02_2,Do you have the authority to get it taken off?
d_counseling_crow_02_3,...
d_counseling_crow_02_4,I will make the request to Syuen.
d_counseling_crow_02_5,...
d_counseling_crow_02_6,Tsk. I knew you would react like that.
d_counseling_crow_02_7,What?
d_counseling_crow_02_8,Ha. Ha.
d_counseling_crow_02_9,Your joke was so funny I almost forgot to laugh.
d_counseling_crow_02_10,I get to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_03_1,Viper is up to something.
d_counseling_crow_03_2,I just can't figure out what it is.
d_counseling_crow_03_3,I'll try to snoop around.
d_counseling_crow_03_4,Do you have any guesses?
d_counseling_crow_03_5,No. Just leave her be.
d_counseling_crow_03_6,It might be a lot more fun this way.
d_counseling_crow_03_7,No good leads yet.
d_counseling_crow_03_8,"Either she's starting a riot, or about to jump into one."
d_counseling_crow_03_9,Heck. Maybe it's both.
d_counseling_crow_03_10,I get to understand Crow's interpersonal relationships.
d_counseling_crow_04_1,Jackal seems even more stupid these days.
d_counseling_crow_04_2,Any good tips for training a dog?
d_counseling_crow_04_3,Jackal is not a dog.
d_counseling_crow_04_4,I will ask a Nikke who owns a dog.
d_counseling_crow_04_5,What is that?
d_counseling_crow_04_6,Jackal is a dog.
d_counseling_crow_04_7,"Once you get bitten, you'll know."
d_counseling_crow_04_8,"Hey, that'd be a great help."
d_counseling_crow_04_9,"Since the wealthy old people of the Royal Road are the only ones allowed to keep dogs,"
d_counseling_crow_04_10,I have no idea who else to ask.
d_counseling_crow_04_11,I have a friendly conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_05_1,What's the difference between humans and Nikkes?
d_counseling_crow_05_2,Just the mechanical aspects of the body.
d_counseling_crow_05_3,The possibility of duplication.
d_counseling_crow_05_4,Huh. I see...
d_counseling_crow_05_5,"Nikkes' bodies are mostly mechanical, after all."
d_counseling_crow_05_6,Huh. I see.
d_counseling_crow_05_7,You can always just make more Nikkes.
d_counseling_crow_05_8,"That makes it hard to think of them as human, right?"
d_counseling_crow_05_9,Interesting. Is that what most people think?
d_counseling_crow_05_10,I share a deep conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_06_1,"{AccountData.NickName}, let me ask you one thing."
d_counseling_crow_06_2,Say you have a bottle filled with disgusting little maggots.
d_counseling_crow_06_3,Would you use wash and reuse that bottle?
d_counseling_crow_06_4,Or would you just burn it?
d_counseling_crow_06_5,I would wash it and reuse it.
d_counseling_crow_06_6,I would burn it.
d_counseling_crow_06_7,"... Hey, Pal?"
d_counseling_crow_06_8,You really don't know when to give up.
d_counseling_crow_06_9,That's why I always want to test your limits...
d_counseling_crow_06_10,Right?
d_counseling_crow_06_11,It's no different in the Ark.
d_counseling_crow_06_12,Burning something is faster than cleaning.
d_counseling_crow_06_13,I share a deep conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_07_1,"Hey, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_counseling_crow_07_2,You ever been to the Outer Rim?
d_counseling_crow_07_3,Yes.
d_counseling_crow_07_4,No.
d_counseling_crow_07_5,Oh. Really?
d_counseling_crow_07_6,It's a nasty place.
d_counseling_crow_07_7,"It's also what the real Ark looks like, without any modification."
d_counseling_crow_07_8,That's why I like it.
d_counseling_crow_07_9,"... Hey, Pal?"
d_counseling_crow_07_10,You really know nothing about the Ark.
d_counseling_crow_07_11,I share a deep conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_08_1,"Yesterday, a Nikke said I was a psychopath."
d_counseling_crow_08_2,She said I was promoting rebellion.
d_counseling_crow_08_3,What do you think?
d_counseling_crow_08_4,I think she's right.
d_counseling_crow_08_5,"No, of course not."
d_counseling_crow_08_6,...
d_counseling_crow_08_7,Hm. It's refreshing to hear someone to just say what they think.
d_counseling_crow_08_8,"Yeah, right?"
d_counseling_crow_08_9,I'm not a psychopath. I'm probably more of a sociopath.
d_counseling_crow_08_10,I get to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_09_1,I want to go to Royal Road...
d_counseling_crow_09_2,"But, it's hard for outlaws like me to set foot there."
d_counseling_crow_09_3,Any ideas?
d_counseling_crow_09_4,I'll take you there.
d_counseling_crow_09_5,Why do you want to go there?
d_counseling_crow_09_6,I was hoping you'd say that.
d_counseling_crow_09_7,Then two of us will create very exciting news on the Tetra Net.
d_counseling_crow_09_8,...
d_counseling_crow_09_9,Can't a girl just try to relax every once in a while?
d_counseling_crow_09_10,"Blowing up the same numbskulls every day gets pretty boring, you know."
d_counseling_crow_09_11,I share a serious conversation with Crow.
d_counseling_crow_10_1,"You know, it might be hard to believe, but actually I love idealists like you."
d_counseling_crow_10_2,Can you guess why?
d_counseling_crow_10_3,Because you enjoy breaking their ideals.
d_counseling_crow_10_4,"Because, deep down, you're an idealist, too."
d_counseling_crow_10_5,Ha! You must be a mind reader.
d_counseling_crow_10_6,There is nothing more beautiful than a pompous idealist's frustration.
d_counseling_crow_10_7,Fireworks are most beautiful when they explode. It's kind of like that.
d_counseling_crow_10_8,Why would you say something like that about me?
d_counseling_crow_10_9,Don't project your childish wishes on me.
d_counseling_crow_10_10,I never think so because I'm a sociopath. I just pretend to be the same kind when they benefit me.
d_counseling_crow_10_11,I get to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_11_1,"If you've been waiting on a message from someone for a long time,"
d_counseling_crow_11_2,how do you keep yourself from getting too anxious?
d_counseling_crow_11_3,Concentrate on something else.
d_counseling_crow_11_4,Tell them to hurry it up.
d_counseling_crow_11_5,... Hmm.
d_counseling_crow_11_6,"It's a good suggestion, but not for me. I like things done in a hurry."
d_counseling_crow_11_7,"Yeah, maybe I should give them a call."
d_counseling_crow_11_8,Crow picked up the cellphone.
d_counseling_crow_11_9,"...Hey, Viper. I told you to detonate it ages ago, how come you're still setting up?"
d_counseling_crow_11_10,I got to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_12_1,"Since you're a Commander, you probably run into all sorts of different Nikkes."
d_counseling_crow_12_2,Is there anyone you could never be close to?
d_counseling_crow_12_3,"Well... you, for one."
d_counseling_crow_12_4,Such a thing would never happen.
d_counseling_crow_12_5,... I'm sorry to hear that.
d_counseling_crow_12_6,"But, as the saying goes, opposites attract."
d_counseling_crow_12_7,I'm sure you'll warm up to me in time.
d_counseling_crow_12_8,You may be right.
d_counseling_crow_12_9,"Where there's a will, there's a way."
d_counseling_crow_12_10,"If it's a Nikke we're talking about, then you could, say... input a code into her brain."
d_counseling_crow_12_11,I got to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_13_1,I don't like the way the riff-raff have been acting lately.
d_counseling_crow_13_2,How can I set them straight?
d_counseling_crow_13_3,Just trust them and give them time.
d_counseling_crow_13_4,Tell them specifically what they're doing wrong.
d_counseling_crow_13_5,I'm not sure about that. They've let me down too many times at this point.
d_counseling_crow_13_6,"If those morons had their heads on straight,"
d_counseling_crow_13_7,then the Ark and the Outer Rim would be equal in terms of policing by now.
d_counseling_crow_13_8,"In theory, that's what should be done."
d_counseling_crow_13_9,But I'm not so confident I'll be able to resist the urge to murder them in the process.
d_counseling_crow_13_10,Should I get Viper to do it for me?
d_counseling_crow_13_11,I speak with Crow about educating subordinates.
d_counseling_crow_14_1,What do you think of Syuen and Missilis?
d_counseling_crow_14_2,She's a boon to mankind.
d_counseling_crow_14_3,...
d_counseling_crow_14_4,A fairly standard opinion...
d_counseling_crow_14_5,"Well, I don't see any reason why someone of your stature would think otherwise."
d_counseling_crow_14_6,I can tell by your face there's a lot remaining unsaid here.
d_counseling_crow_14_7,"After all, you and Syuen are always at each other's throats."
d_counseling_crow_14_8,It's nice to know we have a mutual enemy.
d_counseling_crow_14_9,Crow and I discuss our feelings about The Big Three.
d_counseling_crow_15_1,Someone told me today that
d_counseling_crow_15_2,I'm technically the leader of Heavenly Ascension.
d_counseling_crow_15_3,I'm sure you're not.
d_counseling_crow_15_4,Is that not correct?
d_counseling_crow_15_5,...
d_counseling_crow_15_6,Are you stupid?
d_counseling_crow_15_7,What are you talking about? Heavenly Ascension has its own separate leader.
d_counseling_crow_15_8,"She is a bit dense, so I have to interject sometimes..."
d_counseling_crow_15_9,Now that I think about it... I suppose it's pretty much the same thing.
d_counseling_crow_15_10,I talk with Crow about her relationship with Heavenly Ascension.
d_counseling_crow_16_1,"Hey {AccountData.NickName}, what do you admire most in a person?"
d_counseling_crow_16_2,Firm beliefs.
d_counseling_crow_16_3,Know-how.
d_counseling_crow_16_4,"Oh yes, very true indeed."
d_counseling_crow_16_5,"Let me tell you, the sense of pleasure when you break down"
d_counseling_crow_16_6,someone with firmly held beliefs... nothing compares.
d_counseling_crow_16_7,You don't say...
d_counseling_crow_16_8,Very well.
d_counseling_crow_16_9,I hope you get along with whomever you're referring to.
d_counseling_crow_16_10,I got to understand Crow a little better.
d_counseling_crow_17_1,Outer Rim is a place filled with outlaws and undesirables.
d_counseling_crow_17_2,If you had the power to break down the partition
d_counseling_crow_17_3,"that separated the Outer Rim and the Ark,"
d_counseling_crow_17_4,would you do it?
d_counseling_crow_17_5,Yes.
d_counseling_crow_17_6,No.
d_counseling_crow_17_7,An admirable answer.
d_counseling_crow_17_8,You'd stubbornly insist on adhering to your beliefs
d_counseling_crow_17_9,even if it meant the deaths of innocent civilians. Wonderful.
d_counseling_crow_17_10,What a boring answer.
d_counseling_crow_17_11,Since when were you such a realist?
d_counseling_crow_17_12,Crow and I have a lively discussion about politics.
d_counseling_crow_18_1,I wanted to give Jackal a gift.
d_counseling_crow_18_2,Any recommendations?
d_counseling_crow_18_3,A cute hair scrunchie.
d_counseling_crow_18_4,A dog toy.
d_counseling_crow_18_5,...
d_counseling_crow_18_6,You know she doesn't wear that sort of thing.
d_counseling_crow_18_7,"Now, do you intend on actually giving me a proper recommendation?"
d_counseling_crow_18_8,...!!
d_counseling_crow_18_9,What a unique idea!
d_counseling_crow_18_10,A few traitors would make for wonderful playthings.
d_counseling_crow_18_11,Crow and I talk about the art of giving gifts to colleagues.
d_counseling_crow_19_1,"Reclaiming the surface, reclaiming the surface..."
d_counseling_crow_19_2,"It's always bandied about like it's a given, but is it actually possible?"
d_counseling_crow_19_3,"As long as you don't give up, there is always hope."
d_counseling_crow_19_4,I doubt it will happen in my lifetime.
d_counseling_crow_19_5,... That's true.
d_counseling_crow_19_6,"Then again, those fools who go bankrupt playing the lottery have the same mindset."
d_counseling_crow_19_7,But the fact that you still fight
d_counseling_crow_19_8,must mean you're willing to make personal sacrifices for a future generation you'll never know.
d_counseling_crow_19_9,"I can't say I understand it, but it is very intriguing."
d_counseling_crow_19_10,I converse with Crow about the feasibility of reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_crow_20_1,"Have you ever wanted something so badly, that you were willing to die for it?"
d_counseling_crow_20_2,"No, never."
d_counseling_crow_20_3,"Yes, the safety of the people."
d_counseling_crow_20_4,... How disappointing.
d_counseling_crow_20_5,I thought for sure you would come up with something.
d_counseling_crow_20_6,Interesting...
d_counseling_crow_20_7,I wish for destruction.
d_counseling_crow_20_8,"That way, you and I can wreak havoc together."
d_counseling_crow_20_9,Crow and I have an in-depth conversation.
d_counseling_delta_01_1,Commander.
d_counseling_delta_01_2,I heard your schedule has been exhausting lately.
d_counseling_delta_01_3,Take this opportunity to get some rest and relaxation at the Outpost.
d_counseling_delta_01_4,Thank you. I'll get some rest.
d_counseling_delta_01_5,I'm afraid not. No way I'm letting my guard down.
d_counseling_delta_01_6,I knew it.
d_counseling_delta_01_7,You are not taking the mission seriously enough.
d_counseling_delta_01_8,I must do a better job of training you to stay focused.
d_counseling_delta_01_9,... Good.
d_counseling_delta_01_10,"In wartime, letting your guard down is no different from surrender."
d_counseling_delta_01_11,Our training continues tomorrow.
d_counseling_delta_01_12,I talk with Delta about training.
d_counseling_delta_02_1,"Lately,"
d_counseling_delta_02_2,I am worried that I have been too harsh when talking to Signal.
d_counseling_delta_02_3,I don't think so. You sound warm and kind.
d_counseling_delta_02_4,You really should treat Signal better.
d_counseling_delta_02_5,!!
d_counseling_delta_02_6,Incorrect.
d_counseling_delta_02_7,No need to comfort me with lies.
d_counseling_delta_02_8,I see.
d_counseling_delta_02_9,Thank you for your sincere feedback.
d_counseling_delta_02_10,I talk with Delta about Signal.
d_counseling_delta_03_1,What kind of food do you prefer?
d_counseling_delta_03_2,"Spicy, or not spicy?"
d_counseling_delta_03_3,"In war, any food will do."
d_counseling_delta_03_4,Not spicy.
d_counseling_delta_03_5,!!
d_counseling_delta_03_6,"That is correct, Commander."
d_counseling_delta_03_7,Rations are a valuable resource in war.
d_counseling_delta_03_8,This is the only opinion that matters.
d_counseling_delta_03_9,... Is that so?
d_counseling_delta_03_10,Your answer is spoken without great conviction.
d_counseling_delta_03_11,"Yet, I still choose to believe you."
d_counseling_delta_03_12,I talk with Delta about our favorite foods.
d_counseling_delta_04_1,"Seraphim advised me to get some rest,"
d_counseling_delta_04_2,but all I want to do is train.
d_counseling_delta_04_3,What is the correct course of action?
d_counseling_delta_04_4,Take the effort you would have put into rest and put it into training.
d_counseling_delta_04_5,Follow Seraphim's advice.
d_counseling_delta_04_6,I had not considered this approach!
d_counseling_delta_04_7,I will give your proposal careful consideration.
d_counseling_delta_04_8,"Is that your official opinion, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_04_9,...
d_counseling_delta_04_10,Apologies. I cannot neglect my training.
d_counseling_delta_04_11,I must consider alternative solutions.
d_counseling_delta_04_12,I talk with Delta about taking breaks.
d_counseling_delta_05_1,"Commander, do you have a type?"
d_counseling_delta_05_2,Why do you ask?
d_counseling_delta_05_3,I like people who work hard for themselves.
d_counseling_delta_05_4,"Answering a question with a question is considered impolite, Commander."
d_counseling_delta_05_5,I ask because I infer that many of the Nikkes are curious about what you like.
d_counseling_delta_05_6,"But if you don't have one, that is also an acceptable answer."
d_counseling_delta_05_7,I see.
d_counseling_delta_05_8,Hard work... an admirable answer.
d_counseling_delta_05_9,"When the Nikkes hear this, I believe it will motivate them to better themselves."
d_counseling_delta_05_10,I have a serious conversation about types with Delta.
d_counseling_delta_06_1,Someone asked me about my hobbies. I said my hobby is training.
d_counseling_delta_06_2,They thought it was a joke.
d_counseling_delta_06_3,Is it funny to treat training as a hobby?
d_counseling_delta_06_4,Nothing could be more serious than training.
d_counseling_delta_06_5,Maybe they just thought your answer was unusual.
d_counseling_delta_06_6,I am happy that you think so.
d_counseling_delta_06_7,"Yet, you did not answer my question."
d_counseling_delta_06_8,I cannot understand what is unusual about my answer.
d_counseling_delta_06_9,"However, your reply has given me a clue about how others see me."
d_counseling_delta_06_10,Thank you for your advice.
d_counseling_delta_06_11,I have a conversation with Delta about hobbies.
d_counseling_delta_07_1,Commander.
d_counseling_delta_07_2,What goes through your mind during battle?
d_counseling_delta_07_3,I'm thinking about how to save everyone.
d_counseling_delta_07_4,I'm thinking about how to win.
d_counseling_delta_07_5,Save... everyone?
d_counseling_delta_07_6,What a naïve and arrogant answer.
d_counseling_delta_07_7,"But,"
d_counseling_delta_07_8,I honestly appreciate your concern.
d_counseling_delta_07_9,...
d_counseling_delta_07_10,Of course. That is the only possible answer.
d_counseling_delta_07_11,I have a conversation with Delta about thoughts during battle.
d_counseling_delta_08_1,I've heard that music can bring you inner peace.
d_counseling_delta_08_2,Could you recommend some music?
d_counseling_delta_08_3,Julia's violin performance.
d_counseling_delta_08_4,Military anthems.
d_counseling_delta_08_5,Hm... Her music does exhibit calming effects.
d_counseling_delta_08_6,"However, I do not enjoy it. I do not know why."
d_counseling_delta_08_7,The purpose of a military anthem is not to create inner peace.
d_counseling_delta_08_8,...
d_counseling_delta_08_9,"But, in my case, perhaps it would work perfectly."
d_counseling_delta_08_10,Thank you for your advice.
d_counseling_delta_08_11,I have a conversation with Delta about music for a while.
d_counseling_delta_09_1,"Signal invited me to the Royal Road today,"
d_counseling_delta_09_2,but I never feel at ease in that kind of place.
d_counseling_delta_09_3,How should I decline her offer?
d_counseling_delta_09_4,Just tell her you'll be training.
d_counseling_delta_09_5,Think of it as team building.
d_counseling_delta_09_6,...
d_counseling_delta_09_7,I thought you would at least give me a well-considered answer.
d_counseling_delta_09_8,Team building...
d_counseling_delta_09_9,"Fine. If I see it as a mission with an objective, I can accept it."
d_counseling_delta_09_10,Thank you for your advice.
d_counseling_delta_09_11,Delta and I discuss ways to adapt to Royal Road.
d_counseling_delta_10_1,"Someone once told me,"
d_counseling_delta_10_2,I live my life like there is no future.
d_counseling_delta_10_3,I suppose it is true. I have never considered the future.
d_counseling_delta_10_4,"Do you ever think about it, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_10_5,No. I live in the moment.
d_counseling_delta_10_6,All the time.
d_counseling_delta_10_7,"Is that so, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_10_8,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_delta_10_9,"I want to live my life to the fullest, not waste it longing for a distant future."
d_counseling_delta_10_10,It suits me better.
d_counseling_delta_10_11,Really?
d_counseling_delta_10_12,"I agree that it is good to hold a dream in your heart, but..."
d_counseling_delta_10_13,"If you think too much about the future,"
d_counseling_delta_10_14,you will feel miserable in the present. I hope you will take this into consideration.
d_counseling_delta_10_15,I have a deep discussion about the present and the future with Delta.
d_counseling_delta_11_1,I don't invest in anything unless it truly impresses me.
d_counseling_delta_11_2,That's why I think Signal is awesome.
d_counseling_delta_11_3,What are you willing to invest your time and money into?
d_counseling_delta_11_4,Something that piques my interest.
d_counseling_delta_11_5,Someone that piques my interest.
d_counseling_delta_11_6,You don't say...
d_counseling_delta_11_7,"As for me, my interests lie in work-related tasks and training."
d_counseling_delta_11_8,It's hard for me to imagine being interested in much else.
d_counseling_delta_11_9,...!
d_counseling_delta_11_10,Is that something that you make a habit of doing?
d_counseling_delta_11_11,"Very well then, I'll try to invest in you a little more, Commander."
d_counseling_delta_11_12,Delta and I invest our time and energy into having a discussion.
d_counseling_delta_12_1,I think it's important to set personal goals for yourself.
d_counseling_delta_12_2,"What are you setting out to accomplish this year, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_12_3,To just get through it alive.
d_counseling_delta_12_4,To reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_delta_12_5,"Sure, keeping yourself out of harm's way is important,"
d_counseling_delta_12_6,but I thought someone like you
d_counseling_delta_12_7,would have set a more defined goal for themselves.
d_counseling_delta_12_8,I thought you would say that.
d_counseling_delta_12_9,I myself aspire to the same goal.
d_counseling_delta_12_10,I will do everything I can to make it happen.
d_counseling_delta_12_11,Delta and I promised each other that we would succeed with our goals.
d_counseling_delta_13_1,I've heard hobbies can be more enjoyable when done with other people.
d_counseling_delta_13_2,"So I was thinking about picking up one of your hobbies, so we can share it."
d_counseling_delta_13_3,"What are you setting out to accomplish this year, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_13_4,What pastimes do you often indulge in?
d_counseling_delta_13_5,Weapons research.
d_counseling_delta_13_6,"As in, the mall and all of that?"
d_counseling_delta_13_7,"I'm not a very materialistic person, so I'm not sure whether that will suit me."
d_counseling_delta_13_8,"Still, I'll give it a try."
d_counseling_delta_13_9,I didn't know you were so interested in weaponry.
d_counseling_delta_13_10,That's something I'd gladly participate in.
d_counseling_delta_13_11,Let me know the next time you're conducting any weapons research.
d_counseling_delta_13_12,Delta and I speak more on the topic of hobbies.
d_counseling_delta_14_1,What would you do
d_counseling_delta_14_2,if we fail to reclaim the surface and things merely remain as they are?
d_counseling_delta_14_3,I'd refuse to give up.
d_counseling_delta_14_4,I would feel quite exasperated.
d_counseling_delta_14_5,"As expected, you were never a quitter."
d_counseling_delta_14_6,"No matter where this path we're on leads us, I'll follow you until the very end."
d_counseling_delta_14_7,"If the days pass without any noticeable change,"
d_counseling_delta_14_8,"it will get to the best of us, even if it is you, Commander."
d_counseling_delta_14_9,But don't you worry
d_counseling_delta_14_10,since I will never give up.
d_counseling_delta_14_11,Delta and I continue to have a conversation about the future.
d_counseling_delta_15_1,I've heard certain animals dance upon hearing compliments.
d_counseling_delta_15_2,"If you received a compliment, what type of dance would you like to do?"
d_counseling_delta_15_3,Shouldn't you be asking me what kind of compliment I'd want to hear instead?
d_counseling_delta_15_4,Popping and locking.
d_counseling_delta_15_5,"Oh, is that what I should be focusing on?"
d_counseling_delta_15_6,"Actually, I just wanted to see you dance."
d_counseling_delta_15_7,"All right then, what kind of compliment would you like to be given?"
d_counseling_delta_15_8,"I don't know what dance that is, but I'm sure it's great."
d_counseling_delta_15_9,I'll be sure to shower you with some compliments soon.
d_counseling_delta_15_10,Delta and I talk about the positive power of complimenting others.
d_counseling_delta_16_1,"Hey Commander, how are you feeling?"
d_counseling_delta_16_2,Great.
d_counseling_delta_16_3,Not so good.
d_counseling_delta_16_4,You always keep yourself in tip-top shape.
d_counseling_delta_16_5,"However, you are still human, so it's easy to overexert yourself."
d_counseling_delta_16_6,"Therefore, you must continue to build up your stamina."
d_counseling_delta_16_7,Let's train together later.
d_counseling_delta_16_8,Have you not been taking good care of yourself?
d_counseling_delta_16_9,Although it's good not to have a lax attitude towards everything.
d_counseling_delta_16_10,it's just as important to rest whenever your body is telling you it doesn't feel well.
d_counseling_delta_16_11,"You're not a Nikke, after all."
d_counseling_delta_16_12,Delta and I have a conversation about the health condition.
d_counseling_delta_17_1,I always end up making the same mistakes during training.
d_counseling_delta_17_2,I'm worried that I'll make the same mistake when out in the field.
d_counseling_delta_17_3,Do you have any advice for me?
d_counseling_delta_17_4,Trust yourself.
d_counseling_delta_17_5,Trust me.
d_counseling_delta_17_6,"Because I keep repeating the same mistake,"
d_counseling_delta_17_7,"I end up questioning myself, when I should be trusting myself."
d_counseling_delta_17_8,... I apologize for being so weak.
d_counseling_delta_17_9,Very well...
d_counseling_delta_17_10,"Since you have trust in me, I will trust you."
d_counseling_delta_17_11,Thank you.
d_counseling_delta_17_12,"Suddenly, I feel a chill for some reason."
d_counseling_delta_17_13,Delta and I talk about the influence one's mindset can have.
d_counseling_delta_18_1,Do you think it's important how food tastes?
d_counseling_delta_18_2,Of course it is.
d_counseling_delta_18_3,"No, it's not terribly important."
d_counseling_delta_18_4,I'm not so sure I agree.
d_counseling_delta_18_5,"Of course, it's nice if the food you're eating tastes good,"
d_counseling_delta_18_6,"but in times of war, more pressing matters take precedence."
d_counseling_delta_18_7,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_delta_18_8,"In times of war, we cannot afford the luxury of being so fussy about how our food tastes."
d_counseling_delta_18_9,So I'm thankful even to have prepackaged rations.
d_counseling_delta_18_10,Delta and I talk more about food and its taste.
d_counseling_delta_19_1,I'm considering letting the other Nikkes in the Outpost join in on our morning training.
d_counseling_delta_19_2,Could you please transmit a bugle call from the radio tower at approximately 6 AM?
d_counseling_delta_19_3,"Private {AccountData.NickName}, reporting for duty!"
d_counseling_delta_19_4,... I don't think that's such a good idea.
d_counseling_delta_19_5,...!
d_counseling_delta_19_6,You sound very convincing!
d_counseling_delta_19_7,Will you be joining us in the morning as well?
d_counseling_delta_19_8,You don't think so?
d_counseling_delta_19_9,"To be fair, even I was getting a little tired of the wake-up call."
d_counseling_delta_19_10,Any other recommendations as far as the music we can play to get people up and out of bed?
d_counseling_delta_19_11,Delta and I discuss what music would be best to wake up others in the morning.
d_counseling_delta_20_1,These new Nikkes recruits have no discipline.
d_counseling_delta_20_2,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_counseling_delta_20_3,We'd have never allowed such indolence back in my day.
d_counseling_delta_20_4,"Well, they're still just a bunch of greenhorns."
d_counseling_delta_20_5,I couldn't agree more.
d_counseling_delta_20_6,We can't allow such a sad state of affairs to continue.
d_counseling_delta_20_7,I'll arrange for some special late-night training sessions.
d_counseling_delta_20_8,That's no excuse!
d_counseling_delta_20_9,We must give them proper training so that they can work together down the line.
d_counseling_delta_20_10,Delta and I reminisce about our days as new recruits back in the day.
d_counseling_diesel_01_1,"Hey Commander, you've been spacing out"
d_counseling_diesel_01_2,in the office for a while.
d_counseling_diesel_01_3,Are you bored or something?
d_counseling_diesel_01_4,Yes.
d_counseling_diesel_01_5,Nope.
d_counseling_diesel_01_6,I knew it!
d_counseling_diesel_01_7,My eyes never deceive me.
d_counseling_diesel_01_8,"It's like you have ""Help! I'm bored and I want to do something!"" written all over your face."
d_counseling_diesel_01_9,How about a strawberry candy?
d_counseling_diesel_01_10,"Oh, come on!"
d_counseling_diesel_01_11,"Even I can see that you have ""I'm bored"" written all over your face."
d_counseling_diesel_01_12,"But if you say you're not, I'll believe you."
d_counseling_diesel_01_13,"Have a strawberry candy, then?"
d_counseling_diesel_01_14,I talk with Diesel while eating the strawberry candy she gives me.
d_counseling_diesel_02_1,Soline said she was tired of eating strawberry candy.
d_counseling_diesel_02_2,She said she wanted something else for a change.
d_counseling_diesel_02_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_diesel_02_4,No more candy for her.
d_counseling_diesel_02_5,Give her some better strawberry candy.
d_counseling_diesel_02_6,Hm... Is that really the only way?
d_counseling_diesel_02_7,It makes me feel so sad...
d_counseling_diesel_02_8,"Whoa, fantastic idea!"
d_counseling_diesel_02_9,"I haven't gone shopping for candy in a long time. Strawberry candies, here I come!"
d_counseling_diesel_02_10,Diesel tells me all about her favorite strawberry candy.
d_counseling_diesel_03_1,"Heeey... Commander,"
d_counseling_diesel_03_2,Brid has been feeling down lately.
d_counseling_diesel_03_3,I'm worried about her.
d_counseling_diesel_03_4,What can I do to cheer her up?
d_counseling_diesel_03_5,Ask Soline to stay away from Brid for a while.
d_counseling_diesel_03_6,Help Brid with some of her work.
d_counseling_diesel_03_7,"Haha! You mean, remove her main source of stress?"
d_counseling_diesel_03_8,"I wouldn't mind that. And then I could spend more time with Soline, too."
d_counseling_diesel_03_9,"I can help Brid and play with Soline at the same time!
That's what I call a win-win scenario!"
d_counseling_diesel_03_10,That would make Brid even more upset!
d_counseling_diesel_03_11,"She's so responsible, she has to do all her work herself or she'll feel stressed out."
d_counseling_diesel_03_12,"Buuut... I guess I should go ask her if she needs help, just in case!"
d_counseling_diesel_03_13,I chat with Diesel about ways to help Brid relax.
d_counseling_diesel_04_1,"Commander, do you like soft flavors or strong flavors?"
d_counseling_diesel_04_2,Soft.
d_counseling_diesel_04_3,Strong.
d_counseling_diesel_04_4,Oh. I see.
d_counseling_diesel_04_5,I had no idea! I always give you my strongest strawberry candy.
d_counseling_diesel_04_6,I guess I should give you the strawberry milk candy instead.
d_counseling_diesel_04_7,"Haha! Me, too!"
d_counseling_diesel_04_8,I like pure strawberry candy with no milk!
d_counseling_diesel_04_9,"From now on, I'll give you all my strongest, purest candy!"
d_counseling_diesel_04_10,I have a cheerful conversation with Diesel about strawberry candy preferences.
d_counseling_diesel_05_1,Ding dong! Out of the way!
d_counseling_diesel_05_2,AZX is coming through! Ding dong!
d_counseling_diesel_05_3,"She's out of tune, but just let her sing."
d_counseling_diesel_05_4,"She's out of tune, so tell her to stop."
d_counseling_diesel_05_5,Passengers over there! Please be careful!
d_counseling_diesel_05_6,The train is coming through! Ding dong!
d_counseling_diesel_05_7,"Thank you for letting me finish the song, Commander."
d_counseling_diesel_05_8,Oops! I was just so carried away by the music.
d_counseling_diesel_05_9,"Sooorry, Commander!"
d_counseling_diesel_05_10,I have a cheerful chat with Diesel.
d_counseling_diesel_06_1,"Commander, did you like Ark Rangers when you were a kid?"
d_counseling_diesel_06_2,I was a huge fan.
d_counseling_diesel_06_3,I never got into them.
d_counseling_diesel_06_4,"Haha, I see!"
d_counseling_diesel_06_5,You must have been so adorable!
d_counseling_diesel_06_6,I wish I could see photos of you when you were little.
d_counseling_diesel_06_7,Oh! You were one of those cool kids who didn't care about trends.
d_counseling_diesel_06_8,You must have been so adorable!
d_counseling_diesel_06_9,I talk with Diesel about childhood.
d_counseling_diesel_07_1,Hm... What a pickle...
d_counseling_diesel_07_2,I really want to make the AZX more pretty.
d_counseling_diesel_07_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_diesel_07_4,Make it the same color as strawberry candy.
d_counseling_diesel_07_5,The AZX is already perfect. No need to decorate.
d_counseling_diesel_07_6,Oh! That would be so cute!
d_counseling_diesel_07_7,"Hm... But...
Its current appearance would be lost forever!"
d_counseling_diesel_07_8,"Oh, my! What a pickle..."
d_counseling_diesel_07_9,!!
d_counseling_diesel_07_10,You're right. The AZX is already perfect
d_counseling_diesel_07_11,without any additional decoration.
d_counseling_diesel_07_12,I didn't even consider that.
d_counseling_diesel_07_13,Thank you sooo much!
d_counseling_diesel_07_14,I talk with Diesel about the cute AZX.
d_counseling_diesel_08_1,What a beautiful day!
d_counseling_diesel_08_2,"If you could take a day off on a nice day like this,"
d_counseling_diesel_08_3,"what would you do, Commander?"
d_counseling_diesel_08_4,Sleep in the office.
d_counseling_diesel_08_5,Practice my singing.
d_counseling_diesel_08_6,"Wow! You must be so tired all the time, right?"
d_counseling_diesel_08_7,But staying cooped up inside will only make you more tired in the end.
d_counseling_diesel_08_8,Taking a walk around the Outpost would be a better choice.
d_counseling_diesel_08_9,!!
d_counseling_diesel_08_10,Practice singing? That sounds so exciting!
d_counseling_diesel_08_11,Can I do it with you?
d_counseling_diesel_08_12,I chat with Diesel about how to have a pleasant holiday.
d_counseling_diesel_09_1,Hey! There's something I want to know.
d_counseling_diesel_09_2,What would I be doing if I hadn't come to work at Arc Express?
d_counseling_diesel_09_3,Probably a pop idol.
d_counseling_diesel_09_4,Definitely a kindergarten teacher.
d_counseling_diesel_09_5,Do you really think so?
d_counseling_diesel_09_6,Wow! Just thinking about it makes me so happy!
d_counseling_diesel_09_7,I feel like my dream has come true!
d_counseling_diesel_09_8,Oh... Yes. I do love playing with kids.
d_counseling_diesel_09_9,I guess I would make a good teacher.
d_counseling_diesel_09_10,I spend some time chatting with Diesel.
d_counseling_diesel_10_1,"Commander, if time machines were real,"
d_counseling_diesel_10_2,would you want to go back and change anything?
d_counseling_diesel_10_3,Yes.
d_counseling_diesel_10_4,No.
d_counseling_diesel_10_5,"Gee! So, you feel the same as me!"
d_counseling_diesel_10_6,I didn't expect that.
d_counseling_diesel_10_7,"But it makes sense. After all, everyone has regrets."
d_counseling_diesel_10_8,That includes me!
d_counseling_diesel_10_9,"I also have a moment that I really, really regret."
d_counseling_diesel_10_10,Knowing that you feel the same makes me feel comforted.
d_counseling_diesel_10_11,"Hehe, I knew it."
d_counseling_diesel_10_12,"I admire the way you live without regrets, Commander."
d_counseling_diesel_10_13,I spend a quiet time with Diesel reminiscing about the past.
d_counseling_diesel_11_1,"If you could get on the AZX right now and go anywhere you wanted,"
d_counseling_diesel_11_2,where would you go?
d_counseling_diesel_11_3,Somewhere with a lush forest and babbling brook.
d_counseling_diesel_11_4,Somewhere near the ocean where I could hear the sound of crashing waves.
d_counseling_diesel_11_5,So you prefer forested areas?
d_counseling_diesel_11_6,Glancing at the mountains and streams outside the window
d_counseling_diesel_11_7,while riding the AZX would be a real treat.
d_counseling_diesel_11_8,I'm a big fan of the ocean as well.
d_counseling_diesel_11_9,"Sitting by the ocean at night, dipping my toes in the sand, listening to the waves coming in and out..."
d_counseling_diesel_11_10,I could do that forever.
d_counseling_diesel_11_11,"Oh boy, this makes me want to hop in the AZX right now and set off!"
d_counseling_diesel_11_12,Diesel and I talk about the various places we want to visit.
d_counseling_diesel_12_1,I really like the color of the uniform I'm wearing.
d_counseling_diesel_12_2,"What's your favorite color, Commander?"
d_counseling_diesel_12_3,Blue.
d_counseling_diesel_12_4,White.
d_counseling_diesel_12_5,"Hey, me too!"
d_counseling_diesel_12_6,Nothing beats blue.
d_counseling_diesel_12_7,"Whenever I see the color blue, it feels like my mind is clearer than before."
d_counseling_diesel_12_8,I can feel my entire body become more at ease.
d_counseling_diesel_12_9,White is a nice and clean color.
d_counseling_diesel_12_10,Very appropriate for you!
d_counseling_diesel_12_11,Diesel and I talk a little more about our favorite colors.
d_counseling_diesel_13_1,Every button has to be in place with our uniforms when we're on duty.
d_counseling_diesel_13_2,What type of clothing style do you like?
d_counseling_diesel_13_3,Cool and casual.
d_counseling_diesel_13_4,Prim and proper.
d_counseling_diesel_13_5,Really? I didn't expect you to be into a more laidback style.
d_counseling_diesel_13_6,I prefer it myself as well.
d_counseling_diesel_13_7,I wonder what you'd look like with a more casual look...
d_counseling_diesel_13_8,I'm sure it'd look good on you!
d_counseling_diesel_13_9,Hmm...I think you could rock a casual look too!
d_counseling_diesel_13_10,I think you could pull off a more stylish look too.
d_counseling_diesel_13_11,I'm sure you'd cut quite the figure!
d_counseling_diesel_13_12,Diesel and I spent some time talking about our favorite clothing styles.
d_counseling_diesel_14_1,Brid is always pounding down coffee while she's working... I'm actually a little worried.
d_counseling_diesel_14_2,Is there anything else I could get her to drink instead of coffee?
d_counseling_diesel_14_3,Make her a sweet strawberry latte.
d_counseling_diesel_14_4,Why change it? Nothing beats a good cup of joe while you're working.
d_counseling_diesel_14_5,Sounds delicious! My mouth's watering just thinking about it.
d_counseling_diesel_14_6,I'll go and buy all the ingredients.
d_counseling_diesel_14_7,Fresh strawberries may be tough to find though...
d_counseling_diesel_14_8,I hope Brid will like it!
d_counseling_diesel_14_9,But I want to make her something new...
d_counseling_diesel_14_10,I suppose you're right though. Coffee is second to none in terms of increasing your work efficiency.
d_counseling_diesel_14_11,I should buy her a top-of-the-line coffee grinder!
d_counseling_diesel_14_12,Diesel and I try to figure out other drinks that Brid might enjoy.
d_counseling_diesel_15_1,"Whenever I smell something nice, it puts me in a good mood."
d_counseling_diesel_15_2,What's your favorite smell?
d_counseling_diesel_15_3,Sweet fruits
d_counseling_diesel_15_4,Fresh flowers
d_counseling_diesel_15_5,Same! The fruits smell so nice.
d_counseling_diesel_15_6,Especially strawberries!
d_counseling_diesel_15_7,"Whenever I pick up the scent of strawberries, it's as if I'm having strawberry candy."
d_counseling_diesel_15_8,Nothing puts me in a better mood!
d_counseling_diesel_15_9,That's unexpected...
d_counseling_diesel_15_10,I thought you would like the smell of certain fruits better.
d_counseling_diesel_15_11,"Anyway, I'll keep that in mind."
d_counseling_diesel_15_12,Diesel and I talked more about our favorite scents.
d_counseling_diesel_16_1,I've heard certain animals dance after you give them a compliment.
d_counseling_diesel_16_2,"In your mind, what's the ultimate compliment?"
d_counseling_diesel_16_3,Any compliment from you.
d_counseling_diesel_16_4,Any compliment is fine by me.
d_counseling_diesel_16_5,"In that case,"
d_counseling_diesel_16_6,I'll be sure to compliment you every day!
d_counseling_diesel_16_7,"I wonder if you'd start dancing if I gave you enough compliments, hehe!"
d_counseling_diesel_16_8,You seem like a really nice person.
d_counseling_diesel_16_9,I'm happy to have you around.
d_counseling_diesel_16_10,I hope you can stick around for a long time!
d_counseling_diesel_16_11,Diesel showered me with compliments for the rest of the day.
d_counseling_diesel_17_1,"Instead of texting, I prefer calling people."
d_counseling_diesel_17_2,What do you prefer?
d_counseling_diesel_17_3,Texting.
d_counseling_diesel_17_4,Phone calls.
d_counseling_diesel_17_5,"In that case,"
d_counseling_diesel_17_6,I'll text you more from here on out.
d_counseling_diesel_17_7,"If you ask me,"
d_counseling_diesel_17_8,talking with someone over the phone is the way to go.
d_counseling_diesel_17_9,You can more easily tell how the person is feeling when you can hear their voice.
d_counseling_diesel_17_10,"Next time I'm bored, I'll give you a call."
d_counseling_diesel_17_11,Diesel and I had a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_diesel_18_1,"For me, it's the little things that bring me joy."
d_counseling_diesel_18_2,What's something small that makes you happy?
d_counseling_diesel_18_3,I haven't really thought about it.
d_counseling_diesel_18_4,Talking with you.
d_counseling_diesel_18_5,"Don't worry, I'm sure there's plenty out there"
d_counseling_diesel_18_6,that would make you happy.
d_counseling_diesel_18_7,"If anything comes to mind, be sure to let me know!"
d_counseling_diesel_18_8,I didn't realize you enjoyed talking with me so much!
d_counseling_diesel_18_9,Talking with you makes me happy as well.
d_counseling_diesel_18_10,We should try and talk a little more often.
d_counseling_diesel_18_11,Diesel and I have a conversation about happiness.
d_counseling_diesel_19_1,It's always so hard picking out a birthday present.
d_counseling_diesel_19_2,Is there anything you would want as a birthday present?
d_counseling_diesel_19_3,Strawberry cake.
d_counseling_diesel_19_4,It's the thought that counts.
d_counseling_diesel_19_5,"Oooh, sounds delicious!"
d_counseling_diesel_19_6,"Then again, anything with strawberries is bound to be good."
d_counseling_diesel_19_7,"All right then, I'll bake a strawberry cake for your birthday."
d_counseling_diesel_19_9,Hmm... kind of a cookie-cutter answer.
d_counseling_diesel_19_10,You'll be one tough cookie to buy a birthday present for.
d_counseling_diesel_19_11,Diesel and I talked more about birthday presents.
d_counseling_diesel_20_1,"I watched a documentary yesterday, and it talked a lot about death."
d_counseling_diesel_20_2,It got me thinking...
d_counseling_diesel_20_3,What age do you want to live until?
d_counseling_diesel_20_4,I want to be immortal.
d_counseling_diesel_20_5,I want my life to be short and sweet.
d_counseling_diesel_20_6,That'd be great!
d_counseling_diesel_20_7,I want you to live a long long time as well.
d_counseling_diesel_20_8,Don't you think it's sad to live such a short life though?
d_counseling_diesel_20_9,I want you to live a long long time.
d_counseling_diesel_20_10,"Diesel and I talk about our times, and when they'll be up."
d_counseling_dolla_01_1,Client.
d_counseling_dolla_01_2,Do you invest in stocks?
d_counseling_dolla_01_3,I'm investing long-term in Missilis.
d_counseling_dolla_01_4,Are there any good stocks to invest in?
d_counseling_dolla_01_5,Oh. I'm surprised.
d_counseling_dolla_01_6,I thought you disliked Syuen too much to invest in Missilis.
d_counseling_dolla_01_7,"Well, I admire you for separating business from personal matters."
d_counseling_dolla_01_8,Of course.
d_counseling_dolla_01_9,Allow me to recommend a company that will collaborate with us to launch a new product by the end of this month.
d_counseling_dolla_01_10,The product isn't bad. I expect the stock price to skyrocket in the next few weeks.
d_counseling_dolla_01_11,Now's your chance to get in on the ground level...
d_counseling_dolla_01_12,I talk business with Dolla.
d_counseling_dolla_02_1,Client.
d_counseling_dolla_02_2,[The end justifies the means.] What do you think of this saying?
d_counseling_dolla_02_3,I agree.
d_counseling_dolla_02_4,I can't agree.
d_counseling_dolla_02_5,Haha.
d_counseling_dolla_02_6,"Indeed, it's true."
d_counseling_dolla_02_7,"If the result is good, who cares about the process?"
d_counseling_dolla_02_8,"Haha! Well said, Client. I expected you to answer something like that."
d_counseling_dolla_02_9,"Though, my personal point of view does differ substantially from yours..."
d_counseling_dolla_02_10,I spend a meaningful time with Dolla.
d_counseling_dolla_03_1,"Sometimes, I'm not so sure about my colleagues in the squad."
d_counseling_dolla_03_2,"Rupee is completely stupid, and Yan is pretty annoying."
d_counseling_dolla_03_3,Yet you still trust them.
d_counseling_dolla_03_4,"You should be nicer to them, since you guys are working together."
d_counseling_dolla_03_5,... How odd.
d_counseling_dolla_03_6,"You're kinda slow but you always see right through me, Client."
d_counseling_dolla_03_7,For the last time...
d_counseling_dolla_03_8,We do not 'work together.' We simply have a business relationship.
d_counseling_dolla_03_9,I listen to Dolla's banter and give some advice.
d_counseling_dolla_04_1,"Client, I want to ask you something..."
d_counseling_dolla_04_2,What's your ideal type?
d_counseling_dolla_04_3,Someone with ambition...
d_counseling_dolla_04_4,Why you would ask such an odd question?
d_counseling_dolla_04_5,!!
d_counseling_dolla_04_6,Are you... are you just messing with me?
d_counseling_dolla_04_7,Isn't it obvious?
d_counseling_dolla_04_8,"I want to introduce someone special to you, Client."
d_counseling_dolla_04_9,I have an awkward conversation with Dolla about my ideal type.
d_counseling_dolla_05_1,"... Client, I'm going to ask you something, but keep in mind that it's merely a question."
d_counseling_dolla_05_2,Have you ever broken the law?
d_counseling_dolla_05_3,Nope. I'm innocent.
d_counseling_dolla_05_4,Hasn't everyone?
d_counseling_dolla_05_5,Haha. Just as I thought.
d_counseling_dolla_05_6,A truly Client-like answer.
d_counseling_dolla_05_7,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_dolla_05_8,It seems you and I have more in common than I thought.
d_counseling_dolla_05_9,I spend some meaningful time with Dolla.
d_counseling_dolla_06_1,An odd question just occurred to me...
d_counseling_dolla_06_2,What will I be in 10 years?
d_counseling_dolla_06_3,The CEO of a monopoly.
d_counseling_dolla_06_4,The leader of a charity organization.
d_counseling_dolla_06_5,... What?
d_counseling_dolla_06_6,You really think so?
d_counseling_dolla_06_7,Oh my. My heart is pounding right now.
d_counseling_dolla_06_8,... Seriously?
d_counseling_dolla_06_9,"I know, you just wanted me to change my mind, but what you said has the opposite effect."
d_counseling_dolla_06_10,"I'll be a selfish, money-grubbing capitalist to the end."
d_counseling_dolla_06_11,I discuss Dolla's future with her.
d_counseling_dolla_07_1,I've always wanted to know...
d_counseling_dolla_07_2,How can people be content with the things they already have?
d_counseling_dolla_07_3,They find meaning in something other than possessions.
d_counseling_dolla_07_4,"What good is feeling satisfied, anyway?"
d_counseling_dolla_07_5,I acknowledge that this is good advice...
d_counseling_dolla_07_6,"But, no matter what I do, it just doesn't work for me."
d_counseling_dolla_07_7,"... Yeah, right?"
d_counseling_dolla_07_8,"Sorry. I knew the answer, and yet I still asked."
d_counseling_dolla_07_9,I just need to hear those words right now.
d_counseling_dolla_07_10,I spend some meaningful time with Dolla.
d_counseling_dolla_08_1,I've been working nonstop recently so I decided to take on vacation.
d_counseling_dolla_08_2,Any places you recommend?
d_counseling_dolla_08_3,The Commander's Room.
d_counseling_dolla_08_4,The hot springs.
d_counseling_dolla_08_5,...
d_counseling_dolla_08_6,You think there is anything helpful for relaxation beside the air conditioner?
d_counseling_dolla_08_7,Haha. Not a bad idea.
d_counseling_dolla_08_8,Especially if I had someone to go with me and keep me safe...
d_counseling_dolla_08_9,I talk to Dolla about vacation plans.
d_counseling_dolla_09_1,Is there any kind of gadget you've been wanting lately?
d_counseling_dolla_09_2,Ah. Don't get me wrong. Just asking for market research.
d_counseling_dolla_09_3,A smartwatch for everyday wear.
d_counseling_dolla_09_4,A cutting-edge computer.
d_counseling_dolla_09_5,"Oh, you mean the kind that monitors your health and fitness?"
d_counseling_dolla_09_6,"Seems like you enjoy taking care of yourself, Client."
d_counseling_dolla_09_7,Hmm... The computer in the Commander's Room is outdated?
d_counseling_dolla_09_8,Ah. Are you going to get a gaming rig? I've seen you hang out with Exia more often these days.
d_counseling_dolla_09_9,"Either way, thanks. That's very helpful."
d_counseling_dolla_09_10,I help Dolla with her market research.
d_counseling_dolla_10_1,...
d_counseling_dolla_10_2,*Sigh*
d_counseling_dolla_10_3,What's wrong?
d_counseling_dolla_10_4,Did something go wrong with a transaction?
d_counseling_dolla_10_5,"Ah. It's nothing you can help me with, Client."
d_counseling_dolla_10_6,"... But thank you for asking, anyway."
d_counseling_dolla_10_7,Yeah... One of our suppliers got delayed.
d_counseling_dolla_10_8,This could jeopardize one of our biggest deals.
d_counseling_dolla_10_9,"So, I've been thinking. How should I teach these bastards a lesson?"
d_counseling_dolla_10_10,"I spend some quiet time with Dolla, who seems anxious."
d_counseling_dolla_11_1,This question just popped up in my head all of a sudden.
d_counseling_dolla_11_2,"Tell me, how does it feel to never have the upper hand in any relationship you have with others?"
d_counseling_dolla_11_3,I consider it an investment that could potentially pay off big down the line.
d_counseling_dolla_11_4,I'm willing to tolerate it if it's for the sake of my friends and squadmates.
d_counseling_dolla_11_5,I'm not so convinced the payout will be as big as you think.
d_counseling_dolla_11_6,"Despite that, I somewhat understand where you're coming from. It's hard for me to relate to it however"
d_counseling_dolla_11_7,...
d_counseling_dolla_11_8,So are your friends going to support you financially when you get old and decrepit?
d_counseling_dolla_11_9,Dolla and I have a conversation about life.
d_counseling_dolla_12_1,There are some beautiful views in the Ark.
d_counseling_dolla_12_2,Especially when you're looking down on the city from a skyscraper in the city center.
d_counseling_dolla_12_3,"If you want, you could come to my office someday and we can look at it together."
d_counseling_dolla_12_4,"You're not going to make me work overtime or anything, are you?"
d_counseling_dolla_12_5,Anytime.
d_counseling_dolla_12_6,"A romantic, you most surely are not..."
d_counseling_dolla_12_7,but you are pretty sharp.
d_counseling_dolla_12_8,Perfect. Come to the roof of the New Wave building one of these evenings.
d_counseling_dolla_12_9,"While we're at it, you could help me with some unfinished tasks."
d_counseling_dolla_12_10,"The view may be spectacular, but we still have work to do."
d_counseling_dolla_12_11,I made a promise to work late with Dolla.
d_counseling_dolla_13_1,"When the competition has a leg up on you,"
d_counseling_dolla_13_2,does it stress you out? Or do you just ignore it?
d_counseling_dolla_13_3,I don't let it faze me.
d_counseling_dolla_13_4,It lights a fire underneath me.
d_counseling_dolla_13_5,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_dolla_13_6,Nothing wrong with going at your own pace.
d_counseling_dolla_13_7,That's one thing you and I see eye-to-eye on.
d_counseling_dolla_13_8,Cutthroat competition is a blessing.
d_counseling_dolla_13_9,"That way, you feel even more alive when you eventually come out on top."
d_counseling_dolla_13_10,Dolla and I have a conversation about values.
d_counseling_dolla_14_1,"You work under Deputy Chief Andersen, right?"
d_counseling_dolla_14_2,"You don't know what he's into by any chance, do you?"
d_counseling_dolla_14_3,Why? Do you need something from him?
d_counseling_dolla_14_4,Why? Are you interested in him?
d_counseling_dolla_14_5,... Fine. I suppose I don't have to hide anything from you.
d_counseling_dolla_14_6,"It's nothing much, but there's a business opportunity I would like him to invest in."
d_counseling_dolla_14_7,But I can't go about it in any old way.
d_counseling_dolla_14_8,Me?
d_counseling_dolla_14_9,Of course I am.
d_counseling_dolla_14_10,He'd make a fine business partner.
d_counseling_dolla_14_11,Dolla and I talk more about how to give off signals.
d_counseling_dolla_15_1,Do you like going for a drive?
d_counseling_dolla_15_2,"If you were to go with me, where would you go?"
d_counseling_dolla_15_3,To the Outpost.
d_counseling_dolla_15_4,To Royal Road.
d_counseling_dolla_15_5,On purpose? During your free time? In a sports car?
d_counseling_dolla_15_6,... Why on earth would you go there?
d_counseling_dolla_15_7,"That's absurd. If this was an interview, I'd be showing you the door."
d_counseling_dolla_15_8,A safe choice if there ever was one.
d_counseling_dolla_15_9,Very well then. I'll come to pick you up once I'm done with everything over here.
d_counseling_dolla_15_10,I spoke with Dolla and gave suggestions about where we could go for a drive.
d_counseling_dolla_16_1,"Hypothetically speaking, let's say there's a business that's raking in a massive profit."
d_counseling_dolla_16_2,But there is someone interfering with the business.
d_counseling_dolla_16_3,"If this person were to say... disappear, everything would be peachy keen."
d_counseling_dolla_16_4,What would you do? Hypothetically.
d_counseling_dolla_16_5,Do what has to be done.
d_counseling_dolla_16_6,I'd convince them to get with the program.
d_counseling_dolla_16_7,That's what I thought too.
d_counseling_dolla_16_8,But it's more easily said than done.
d_counseling_dolla_16_9,"If I thought they could be convinced, I wouldn't be here contemplating more drastic measures."
d_counseling_dolla_16_10,I suppose it's not a bad answer. You're just being honest.
d_counseling_dolla_16_11,Dolla and I watched a documentary about an ancient group of assassins.
d_counseling_dolla_17_1,"If you, hypothetically speaking, made a minor error..."
d_counseling_dolla_17_2,and ended up losing half of the money an investor gave you...
d_counseling_dolla_17_3,What kind of excuse would you use?
d_counseling_dolla_17_4,I'd go gambling and win back what I lost.
d_counseling_dolla_17_5,"There's still half left, so I wouldn't lose my head."
d_counseling_dolla_17_6,...
d_counseling_dolla_17_7,"If I were the investor, I'd string you up by your toes."
d_counseling_dolla_17_8,Such confidence!
d_counseling_dolla_17_9,You're right. I still have half left.
d_counseling_dolla_17_10,"We're not in the red yet, so there's still a chance. I've got to make it happen."
d_counseling_dolla_17_11,"As I spoke with Dolla, she gave me some investment tips."
d_counseling_dolla_18_1,I found the whereabouts of those who hacked my account.
d_counseling_dolla_18_2,That little punk is barely 15.
d_counseling_dolla_18_3,So I'm a little conflicted. What I should do?
d_counseling_dolla_18_4,I just want to rough him up a bit...
d_counseling_dolla_18_5,What he did was unforgivable.
d_counseling_dolla_18_6,He's young and stupid. He made a mistake.
d_counseling_dolla_18_7,Exactly! I can't let him get off scot-free.
d_counseling_dolla_18_8,"The sooner he learns it's a dog-eat-dog world out there, the better."
d_counseling_dolla_18_9,I don't care how young he is.
d_counseling_dolla_18_10,He committed a crime; a premeditated crime at that.
d_counseling_dolla_18_11,"I'll take what you said into consideration... but at the end of the day, I'll handle this my way."
d_counseling_dolla_18_12,Dolla and I exchange views on juvenile crime.
d_counseling_dolla_19_1,I'm curious about how you handle your finances.
d_counseling_dolla_19_2,"Would you rather save your money, or invest it?"
d_counseling_dolla_19_3,Save.
d_counseling_dolla_19_4,Invest.
d_counseling_dolla_19_5,So you like to play it safe.
d_counseling_dolla_19_6,But as they say...
d_counseling_dolla_19_7,"no risk, no reward."
d_counseling_dolla_19_8,Brilliant.
d_counseling_dolla_19_9,"No risk, no reward."
d_counseling_dolla_19_10,How about we team up and make some investments together?
d_counseling_dolla_19_11,I listen as Dolla gives me a lecture about investment.
d_counseling_dolla_20_1,How much money do you think it takes before you're satisfied?
d_counseling_dolla_20_2,"You'll never be satisfied, no matter how much money you have."
d_counseling_dolla_20_3,"It's all about making money, not how much of it you have."
d_counseling_dolla_20_4,...
d_counseling_dolla_20_5,You're probably right.
d_counseling_dolla_20_6,I'll probably never be satisfied at any point in my life.
d_counseling_dolla_20_7,"Client,"
d_counseling_dolla_20_8,what are you on about?
d_counseling_dolla_20_9,Dolla and I talk about finding satisfaction in life.
d_counseling_drake_01_1,How dare these stupid humans not salute me!
d_counseling_drake_01_2,"Why?
Don't they understand I am a far superior being?"
d_counseling_drake_01_3,"If you salute first, they will salute back."
d_counseling_drake_01_4,Teach these stupid people how to act.
d_counseling_drake_01_5,Will do.
d_counseling_drake_01_6,Ugh! What a pain!
d_counseling_drake_01_7,I practice some salutes with Drake.
d_counseling_drake_02_1,Hahahaha!!
d_counseling_drake_02_2,Ha! Hahaha!
d_counseling_drake_02_3,Hee hee...
d_counseling_drake_02_4,Hahahaha!
d_counseling_drake_02_5,Your laugh sounds creepy.
d_counseling_drake_02_6,Hahahaha!!
d_counseling_drake_02_7,I laugh with Drake for a long time.
d_counseling_drake_03_1,I've collected 5 pizza coupons!
d_counseling_drake_03_2,Now I can finally get one for free!
d_counseling_drake_03_3,"Haha! I'm pretty awesome, right?"
d_counseling_drake_03_4,... Do you want me to order it for you?
d_counseling_drake_03_5,You are pretty awesome!
d_counseling_drake_03_6,"If you don't mind.
I'm not so good at that kind of thing."
d_counseling_drake_03_7,"But I just can't call the pizza boy.
I'm not so good at that kind of thing."
d_counseling_drake_03_8,I listen to Drake praise pizza for a long time.
d_counseling_drake_04_1,I saw an old man fall down on the street today!
d_counseling_drake_04_2,I can't believe no one went to help him!
d_counseling_drake_04_3,"So, I used my own strength!
I picked him right up!"
d_counseling_drake_04_4,You should've let him get up on his own.
d_counseling_drake_04_5,How admirable of you.
d_counseling_drake_04_6,"Moron! How stupid!
How could I treat a poor old man like that?"
d_counseling_drake_04_7,"Oh, hush."
d_counseling_drake_04_8,You'll make me blush.
d_counseling_drake_04_9,I have a conversation with Drake about kindness.
d_counseling_drake_05_1,There is no hope for stupid mankind.
d_counseling_drake_05_2,They're doomed for sure!
d_counseling_drake_05_3,"You have to save them, Drake."
d_counseling_drake_05_4,You're right. These stupid humans are beyond help!
d_counseling_drake_05_5,I will.
d_counseling_drake_05_6,Just trust in me!
d_counseling_drake_05_7,Don't talk like that!
d_counseling_drake_05_8,You're the Commander! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
d_counseling_drake_05_9,I have a conversation with Drake about world peace.
d_counseling_drake_06_1,"Maxwell comes up with
so many weird inventions every day!"
d_counseling_drake_06_2,There's no way she can win battles by relying so much on equipment!
d_counseling_drake_06_3,They are just decoration.
d_counseling_drake_06_4,"Since Maxwell made them, they must be very effective, right?"
d_counseling_drake_06_5,"No!
All equipment is useful!"
d_counseling_drake_06_6,How can you not understand this? Moron!
d_counseling_drake_06_7,Yes.
d_counseling_drake_06_8,"Once you get used to them, you'll never go back."
d_counseling_drake_06_9,I have a conversation with Drake about the importance of equipment.
d_counseling_drake_07_1,Some of my so-called little fans asked me for my autograph the other day.
d_counseling_drake_07_2,They're so annoying.
d_counseling_drake_07_3,How many did you give them?
d_counseling_drake_07_4,"I know, it's annoying."
d_counseling_drake_07_5,20!
d_counseling_drake_07_6,"And it takes me so long to do my gorgeously long signature!
My arms are sore!"
d_counseling_drake_07_7,Hey! It's just their nature!
d_counseling_drake_07_8,Drake tells me how to deal with kids.
d_counseling_drake_08_1,I hate vegetables.
d_counseling_drake_08_2,All I want is meat!
d_counseling_drake_08_3,"So, buy me some Nutrium!
Right! Now!"
d_counseling_drake_08_4,I don't have any money.
d_counseling_drake_08_5,Not before you finish your vegetables.
d_counseling_drake_08_6,You poor guy!
d_counseling_drake_08_7,Come on. I'll buy some for you.
d_counseling_drake_08_8,Okay.
d_counseling_drake_08_9,But you'd better keep your word!
d_counseling_drake_08_10,I listen to Drake talk about the wonders of meat.
d_counseling_drake_09_1,"Fighting is very satisfying,"
d_counseling_drake_09_2,but it's also a little terrifying.
d_counseling_drake_09_3,Do you know what I'm afraid of?
d_counseling_drake_09_4,Becoming too powerful.
d_counseling_drake_09_5,Losing your life.
d_counseling_drake_09_6,That's right!
d_counseling_drake_09_7,"I'm already too powerful!
I'm afraid of getting stronger!"
d_counseling_drake_09_8,It's so lonely at the top!
d_counseling_drake_09_9,I've never been afraid of death.
d_counseling_drake_09_10,Well... Never mind.
d_counseling_drake_09_11,Perhaps my fears are too complex for simpletons to understand.
d_counseling_drake_09_12,I have a conversation with Drake about fighting.
d_counseling_drake_10_1,I only eat well-done meat!
d_counseling_drake_10_2,Eating meat that's not completely cooked makes no sense to me.
d_counseling_drake_10_3,I suppose I wouldn't mind trying it rare or medium...
d_counseling_drake_10_4,"But meat is limited, so we can't waste it on experimentation."
d_counseling_drake_10_5,Challenging your taste is always fascinating.
d_counseling_drake_10_6,How about eating and cooking at the same time?
d_counseling_drake_10_7,No. Meaningless challenges like that are a waste.
d_counseling_drake_10_8,"What if that undercooked meat is not good?
What if I don't like it?"
d_counseling_drake_10_9,"Are you willing to take responsibility for that, Moron?"
d_counseling_drake_10_10,!!
d_counseling_drake_10_11,"Moron, you're a genius!"
d_counseling_drake_10_12,I talk with Drake about meat.
d_counseling_drake_11_1,"In order to become the ultimate villain,"
d_counseling_drake_11_2,I believe you need to watch horror movies all alone.
d_counseling_drake_11_3,Can you handle watching horror movies on your own?
d_counseling_drake_11_4,Horror movies are child's plays to me.
d_counseling_drake_11_5,I can't stand horror movies.
d_counseling_drake_11_6,!!
d_counseling_drake_11_7,You're tougher than I initially thought.
d_counseling_drake_11_8,We'll have to see who can handle the most extreme horror movie at some point.
d_counseling_drake_11_9,Even though my winning is a foregone conclusion.
d_counseling_drake_11_10,Hmph.
d_counseling_drake_11_11,Your weakness sickens me.
d_counseling_drake_11_12,Drake and talk about horror movies.
d_counseling_drake_12_1,The heat... the bright sunlight...
d_counseling_drake_12_2,You can't beat summer!
d_counseling_drake_12_3,I hope we reclaim the surface soon so I can immerse myself in nature once again.
d_counseling_drake_12_4,Summer is a perfect fit for you.
d_counseling_drake_12_5,I'd have thought winter would be a better fit for you.
d_counseling_drake_12_6,"I hate to admit it, but you're right. For once."
d_counseling_drake_12_7,Fiery heat and passion... everything that's associated with summer is a perfect fit for me!
d_counseling_drake_12_8,"Winter has its own charm, but"
d_counseling_drake_12_9,I still think summer is a better fit for me.
d_counseling_drake_12_10,Drake and I talk about the pros and cons of summer.
d_counseling_drake_13_1,I'm about to go to the police station and check something off my bucket list.
d_counseling_drake_13_2,Soon I shall become the ultimate supervillain.
d_counseling_drake_13_3,"In order to accomplish that, I'll go to the police station and..."
d_counseling_drake_13_4,free all of the criminals who are locked up.
d_counseling_drake_13_5,have them put you behind bars.
d_counseling_drake_13_6,You dolt!
d_counseling_drake_13_7,What are you saying?
d_counseling_drake_13_8,The police busted their humps catching those criminals! Why would I undo all of their hard work?
d_counseling_drake_13_9,"Besides, those criminals deserve to be locked up!"
d_counseling_drake_13_10,How did you know?
d_counseling_drake_13_11,Do you dream of becoming a villain as well?
d_counseling_drake_13_12,"Well, this city only has room for one supervillain, so back off!"
d_counseling_drake_13_13,I got some tips from Drake on how to become the ultimate villain.
d_counseling_drake_14_1,I just got this text... someone called me an angel!
d_counseling_drake_14_2,Can you believe that?! Me! An angel!
d_counseling_drake_14_3,Just block that person's account
d_counseling_drake_14_4,"Tell them that you're no angel, but instead the ultimate villain."
d_counseling_drake_14_5,"Well... I thought that might be a little extreme, so"
d_counseling_drake_14_6,I just thanked them and left it at that.
d_counseling_drake_14_7,That's a fantastic reply!
d_counseling_drake_14_8,"That's exactly right! I'm no angel! I'm Drake, the ultimate supervillain!"
d_counseling_drake_14_9,"They caught me off guard, so I still haven't replied."
d_counseling_drake_14_10,I'll send them that reply when I have a minute.
d_counseling_drake_14_11,Drake and I had a very enjoyable discussion.
d_counseling_drake_15_1,Do you know what a villain should do on a roller coaster?
d_counseling_drake_15_2,Not wear their seat belt?
d_counseling_drake_15_3,Never close their eyes?
d_counseling_drake_15_4,!!
d_counseling_drake_15_5,"You moron, what kind of an answer is that?"
d_counseling_drake_15_6,Sometimes I wonder if you actually
d_counseling_drake_15_7,want to become a villain or not.
d_counseling_drake_15_8,"Bingo! To be a true villain, you can't close your eyes"
d_counseling_drake_15_9,until the roller coaster ends.
d_counseling_drake_15_10,That's why I keep my eyes open the entire time! Mwahaha!
d_counseling_drake_15_11,Drake and I talk about our favorite roller coasters.
d_counseling_drake_16_1,"I didn't want any sauce with my fried chicken today, but they gave me some anyway."
d_counseling_drake_16_2,One of the employees must have screwed up.
d_counseling_drake_16_3,File a complaint and send that employee packing!
d_counseling_drake_16_4,Fried chicken is great even with the sauce.
d_counseling_drake_16_5,"Jeez, have a heart!"
d_counseling_drake_16_6,It was just one little mistake... nothing worth firing someone over.
d_counseling_drake_16_7,"You're right about that, nothing beats a good piece of fried chicken!"
d_counseling_drake_16_8,I polished off those drumsticks in no time.
d_counseling_drake_16_9,"Tomorrow I'll order half with sauce and half without. That way, the employee won't get confused."
d_counseling_drake_16_10,Drake and I continue to talk about chicken.
d_counseling_drake_17_1,"I've been looking for a new hobby,"
d_counseling_drake_17_2,but I can't decide what I'd like to do.
d_counseling_drake_17_3,Take up a high-energy sport.
d_counseling_drake_17_4,Horticulture can be very therapeutic...
d_counseling_drake_17_5,"Hmm... Nikkes don't technically need any exercise, but"
d_counseling_drake_17_6,sports could be a nice way to pass the time.
d_counseling_drake_17_7,I'll look into it!
d_counseling_drake_17_8,Are you seriously telling me I should start growing plants?
d_counseling_drake_17_9,You're dumber than I thought.
d_counseling_drake_17_10,Drake and I talk more about different hobbies.
d_counseling_drake_18_1,"If you could turn invisible, what's the first thing you would do?"
d_counseling_drake_18_2,Annihilate every last Rapture.
d_counseling_drake_18_3,Rob a bank.
d_counseling_drake_18_4,Great minds think alike! I was thinking the exact same thing.
d_counseling_drake_18_5,"Although to be fair, I could vanquish all of them without the invisibility gimmick."
d_counseling_drake_18_6,You idiot!
d_counseling_drake_18_7,You're rotten to the core!
d_counseling_drake_18_8,Don't you realize how many people you could end up hurting?!
d_counseling_drake_18_9,You shouldn't do things like that!
d_counseling_drake_18_10,Drake and I spend time imagining what we'd do if we were invisible.
d_counseling_drake_19_1,"When my time is up, what do you think I should have written on my headstone?"
d_counseling_drake_19_2,What?! You'll never die!
d_counseling_drake_19_3,Here lies the ultimate supervillain.
d_counseling_drake_19_4,Damn straight!
d_counseling_drake_19_5,Death is for the weak!
d_counseling_drake_19_6,I shall be immortal! Mwahaha!
d_counseling_drake_19_7,"It has a nice ring to it, but the only problem is... true villains never die!"
d_counseling_drake_19_8,Having said that... I'm gonna take that idea of yours.
d_counseling_drake_19_9,Don't even think about using it on your own headstone.
d_counseling_drake_19_10,Drake and I talk about death.
d_counseling_drake_20_1,"I was planning on eating some fried chicken with Laplace,"
d_counseling_drake_20_2,but she wants it super spicy!
d_counseling_drake_20_3,Spicy chicken is the best!
d_counseling_drake_20_4,"Spicy fried chicken can be good, as long as it's mild."
d_counseling_drake_20_5,I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy stuff.
d_counseling_drake_20_6,My thoughts exactly! You don't want to go overboard with the spice.
d_counseling_drake_20_7,"Besides, who says a villain has to like spicy food?"
d_counseling_drake_20_8,Hahahahaha!!
d_counseling_drake_20_9,Drake and I talk about our favorite way to eat chicken.
d_counseling_emma_01_1,"You know what, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_01_2,I recently made up a new kind of omelet.
d_counseling_emma_01_3,But... no one is willing to try it!
d_counseling_emma_01_4,I wonder why...?
d_counseling_emma_01_5,How about trying it yourself first?
d_counseling_emma_01_6,Because they want you to have more.
d_counseling_emma_01_7,Absolutely not!
d_counseling_emma_01_8,"If I eat one, there will be fewer for everyone else!"
d_counseling_emma_01_9,"O-oh! Well, there's no need for that!"
d_counseling_emma_01_10,I'll just have to make more. Then there will be enough for everyone!
d_counseling_emma_01_11,I have a meaningful conversation with Emma.
d_counseling_emma_02_1,Commaaander! Are you free this weekend?
d_counseling_emma_02_2,Of course.
d_counseling_emma_02_3,I'm kinda busy.
d_counseling_emma_02_4,Wonderful!
d_counseling_emma_02_5,I got a couple tickets for the amusement park.
d_counseling_emma_02_6,"However, Eunhwa and Vesti are too busy to go."
d_counseling_emma_02_7,Do you want to go with me? Hee hee!
d_counseling_emma_02_8,Oh! I'm sorry to hear it.
d_counseling_emma_02_9,"Try not to wear yourself out, OK?"
d_counseling_emma_02_10,I have a good conversation with Emma.
d_counseling_emma_03_1,"What's your favorite color, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_03_2,Black.
d_counseling_emma_03_3,Yellow.
d_counseling_emma_03_4,I know you like mature colors.
d_counseling_emma_03_5,"I'll keep that in mind, hee hee!"
d_counseling_emma_03_6,Hm... I see.
d_counseling_emma_03_7,I would never have guessed that you like cute things.
d_counseling_emma_03_8,Emma and I talk about personal preferences for a while.
d_counseling_emma_04_1,Hm... Vesti and Eunhwa aren't getting along these days.
d_counseling_emma_04_2,Is there anything I can do to help them?
d_counseling_emma_04_3,They'll have to figure it out for themselves.
d_counseling_emma_04_4,Cook for them. Then I'm sure there will be at least one thing they agree on.
d_counseling_emma_04_5,Hm... Really?
d_counseling_emma_04_6,"Still, I'd like to find a way to help them talk with each other."
d_counseling_emma_04_7,How about going for a dip together? Hee hee!
d_counseling_emma_04_8,Hm?
d_counseling_emma_04_9,I'm not sure I understand what you mean...
d_counseling_emma_04_10,"But, I suppose a good meal really can bring people together."
d_counseling_emma_04_11,Thanks for the idea! Hee hee!
d_counseling_emma_04_12,I talk with Emma about her squad members.
d_counseling_emma_05_1,I keep losing things lately.
d_counseling_emma_05_2,Eunhwa and Vesti always come to my rescue...
d_counseling_emma_05_3,"But, I'm supposed to be the big sister!"
d_counseling_emma_05_4,That's just part of your charm.
d_counseling_emma_05_5,Being the big sis doesn't mean you need to be perfect all the time.
d_counseling_emma_05_6,Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_emma_05_7,"You can always find the good in others, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_05_8,"You're a really mature guy, aren't you? Hee hee."
d_counseling_emma_05_9,"Hm... Well, I know that you're right."
d_counseling_emma_05_10,"But, I always want to be the one who takes care of them."
d_counseling_emma_05_11,I listen to Emma's troubles for a while.
d_counseling_emma_06_1,"Uh, Commander...?"
d_counseling_emma_06_2,You look terrible. What's wrong?
d_counseling_emma_06_3,Nothing.
d_counseling_emma_06_4,I'm just overworked.
d_counseling_emma_06_5,"Hm! You know, telling lies is bad,
and it's bad for you."
d_counseling_emma_06_6,Why not use the rest of our counseling session...
d_counseling_emma_06_7,Just as I thought.
d_counseling_emma_06_8,Why not use the rest of our counseling session...
d_counseling_emma_06_9,to get some well-earned sleep?
d_counseling_emma_06_10,Just lie down on this couch and put your head on my knee...
d_counseling_emma_06_11,I sleep a little with head on Emma's knee.
d_counseling_emma_06_12,... So refreshing!
d_counseling_emma_07_1,Commaaander! You worked a very hard day.
d_counseling_emma_07_2,"I prepared a special lunchbox,
just for you!"
d_counseling_emma_07_3,Come on and give it a try!
d_counseling_emma_07_4,"The Splendamin in the spoon is black and green,
just like some abomination from the depths of the ocean..."
d_counseling_emma_07_5,Open your mouth.
d_counseling_emma_07_6,Try to escape.
d_counseling_emma_07_7,Good boy! Hee hee.
d_counseling_emma_07_8,"Here, have some more."
d_counseling_emma_07_9,Are you being picky?
d_counseling_emma_07_11,"Bad boy! Come on, just try it!"
d_counseling_emma_07_13,I have a good time with Emma...
d_counseling_emma_07_14,... and sprint to the bathroom as soon as the talk is over.
d_counseling_emma_08_1,So annoying... What should I do?
d_counseling_emma_08_2,"I went all the way to Royal Road to get this dress, and it doesn't fit!"
d_counseling_emma_08_3,I don't have time to go back and exchange it...
d_counseling_emma_08_4,I can help.
d_counseling_emma_08_5,How about giving it to Eunhwa or Vesti?
d_counseling_emma_08_6,"Well, thank you, but..."
d_counseling_emma_08_7,"Wouldn't you feel a bit embarrassed, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_08_8,"Anyway, I appreciate your kindness. Hee hee!"
d_counseling_emma_08_9,Hm... I've also considered that...
d_counseling_emma_08_10,But it's too big for them.
d_counseling_emma_08_11,We give it to the Scavengers in the end.
d_counseling_emma_09_1,Sometimes people get scared when they first meet me.
d_counseling_emma_09_2,Why is that?
d_counseling_emma_09_3,Maybe it's because of Absolute's reputation.
d_counseling_emma_09_4,It's because you're so pretty.
d_counseling_emma_09_5,"Oh! You mean, we're too powerful?"
d_counseling_emma_09_6,"That makes sense, then."
d_counseling_emma_09_7,"But still, I wish they wouldn't..."
d_counseling_emma_09_8,... Whoa.
d_counseling_emma_09_9,You're really good at saying that.
d_counseling_emma_09_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Emma.
d_counseling_emma_10_1,"Eunhwa is a perfectionist, and sometimes she goes too far."
d_counseling_emma_10_2,How can I get her to loosen up?
d_counseling_emma_10_3,Use your special skills to help her calm down.
d_counseling_emma_10_4,Just support her quietly.
d_counseling_emma_10_5,Special skills?
d_counseling_emma_10_6,I see... I suppose that would be...
d_counseling_emma_10_7,"Full body massage?
Hee hee..."
d_counseling_emma_10_8,"Hm... Well, that's not really my style."
d_counseling_emma_10_9,"But thanks for your advice anyway.
I appreciate it!"
d_counseling_emma_10_10,I listen to Emma's troubles.
d_counseling_emma_11_1,I can barely get any suds going with this new body wash... but I really like how it smells.
d_counseling_emma_11_2,I feel like it'd be a waste buying a new one.
d_counseling_emma_11_3,Hmm... What should I do?
d_counseling_emma_11_4,"It'll keep bugging you until you buy a different brand, so just do it."
d_counseling_emma_11_5,How about mixing it with something else?
d_counseling_emma_11_6,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_emma_11_7,It's a bit of a shame though... I'm sure whoever made this would hate to see it go to waste.
d_counseling_emma_11_8,"... Argh, I can't do it. I'll come with some use for it."
d_counseling_emma_11_9,"Hey, that's pretty smart!"
d_counseling_emma_11_10,People mix together different products all the time.
d_counseling_emma_11_11,What made you think of that?
d_counseling_emma_11_12,Is it because you like mixing things together? Hehehe.
d_counseling_emma_11_13,Emma gives me some tips on how to choose the proper shower supplies.
d_counseling_emma_12_1,How would you define your style?
d_counseling_emma_12_2,"Bold, or understated?"
d_counseling_emma_12_3,"Understated, with hints of boldness."
d_counseling_emma_12_4,"Bold, with some subtle, understated tones."
d_counseling_emma_12_5,Come here for a moment.
d_counseling_emma_12_6,I want to show you something.
d_counseling_emma_12_7,I think it will compliment your style really nicely.
d_counseling_emma_12_8,You'll be full of surprises!
d_counseling_emma_12_9,But I'm afraid that's not quite my style. What a shame...
d_counseling_emma_12_10,Emma and I spend time poring over various clothing options.
d_counseling_emma_13_1,"Whenever people eat my food, there's always some leftover."
d_counseling_emma_13_2,I don't know what's going on. It always seems as if everyone is either full or not hungry.
d_counseling_emma_13_3,...
d_counseling_emma_13_4,Wait... could it be...
d_counseling_emma_13_5,...
d_counseling_emma_13_6,... Maybe they're just feeling under the weather.
d_counseling_emma_13_7,Huh? What's wrong?
d_counseling_emma_13_8,Are you okay? You don't look good.
d_counseling_emma_13_9,Wait right there. I'll whip up something that will put some pep in your step.
d_counseling_emma_13_10,Very true. You lose your appetite whenever you're sick.
d_counseling_emma_13_11,"I had thought of that as well, so I made something a bit healthier. Care to have a taste?"
d_counseling_emma_13_12,"I put in a bunch of nutritious ingredients, so it should be super yummy!"
d_counseling_emma_13_13,...
d_counseling_emma_14_1,I give Eunhwa and Vesti massages every once in a while.
d_counseling_emma_14_2,I get a real kick out of it. Their reactions are wildly different.
d_counseling_emma_14_3,How do you think Eunhwa reacts during a massage?
d_counseling_emma_14_4,Take a guess!
d_counseling_emma_14_5,She probably tries her best not to make a sound.
d_counseling_emma_14_6,She probably moans in ecstasy and makes all sorts of other noises.
d_counseling_emma_14_7,"Ding ding, you got it. That was too easy, wasn't it?"
d_counseling_emma_14_8,"She tries to hide it from me, but you can tell how much she enjoys it."
d_counseling_emma_14_9,It's adorable watching her try to keep silent.
d_counseling_emma_14_10,...
d_counseling_emma_14_11,What a trip it'd be to see that!
d_counseling_emma_14_12,I listen to Emma gush over Absolute.
d_counseling_emma_15_1,I've been feeling out of sorts lately.
d_counseling_emma_15_2,Nothing's been stressing me out... I'm not sure why I feel this way.
d_counseling_emma_15_3,You might be suffering from stress without even realizing it.
d_counseling_emma_15_4,Sounds like it might be a physical issue.
d_counseling_emma_15_5,Really?
d_counseling_emma_15_6,I thought I was managing my stress well.
d_counseling_emma_15_7,I'll think about it in greater detail then...
d_counseling_emma_15_8,Would you be serious for a minute?!
d_counseling_emma_15_9,I'm trying to have a serious discussion with you.
d_counseling_emma_15_10,This isn't the right size! Where is my mind today?
d_counseling_emma_15_11,...
d_counseling_emma_15_12,"You've got a good eye, Commander. Thanks."
d_counseling_emma_15_13,I shared some stress relief techniques with Emma.
d_counseling_emma_16_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_emma_16_2,what do you think is the most important part of cooking?
d_counseling_emma_16_3,Your technical skills.
d_counseling_emma_16_4,Your mindset.
d_counseling_emma_16_5,"No, no, no."
d_counseling_emma_16_6,What's going through your mind is the most important thing. The idea that you're cooking for someone else.
d_counseling_emma_16_7,"Speaking of which, I really put a lot of thought into this tart. Would you like to try it?"
d_counseling_emma_16_8,"Just one bite, and I'm sure you'll see what I mean."
d_counseling_emma_16_9,Exactly! What's going through your mind is the most important thing when you're cooking.
d_counseling_emma_16_10,"Even if you're not the world's best cook, or don't have top-tier ingredients,"
d_counseling_emma_16_11,you can still make wonderful dishes as long as you have the right mindset.
d_counseling_emma_16_12,"Speaking of which, I really put a lot of thought into this tart. Would you like to try it?"
d_counseling_emma_16_13,I snacked on the tart Emma put so much thought into.
d_counseling_emma_17_1,"You don't look so hot, Commander. Is everything okay?"
d_counseling_emma_17_2,Did you not sleep well? You look like you can barely keep your eyes open.
d_counseling_emma_17_3,"I stayed up all night thinking about you, Emma."
d_counseling_emma_17_4,I think I've spread myself too thin over the past few days.
d_counseling_emma_17_5,What... really?
d_counseling_emma_17_6,...
d_counseling_emma_17_7,So... what were you thinking about that made you unable to sleep? Hehehe.
d_counseling_emma_17_8,"Your work ethic is truly astounding, but"
d_counseling_emma_17_9,you have a tendency to overexert yourself.
d_counseling_emma_17_10,"I would tell you to get some rest, but I'm sure there's no point."
d_counseling_emma_17_11,Emma and I talk about the healing effects of sleep.
d_counseling_emma_18_1,"When you're going out with someone,"
d_counseling_emma_18_2,do you usually take the lead? Or do you let the other person take charge?
d_counseling_emma_18_3,I wouldn't know since I've never dated anyone before.
d_counseling_emma_18_4,I can do both. It all depends on who I'm with.
d_counseling_emma_18_5,Huh?
d_counseling_emma_18_6,"Hahaha! You're a terrible liar, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_18_7,Hahaha.
d_counseling_emma_18_8,"Well, you certainly sweep me off my feet every once in a while,"
d_counseling_emma_18_9,which I'm a fan of.
d_counseling_emma_18_10,Emma and I talk about dating.
d_counseling_emma_19_1,"Not to brag, but I'm really good at reading people."
d_counseling_emma_19_2,"I can tell how someone is feeling just by observing their facial expressions, their body movements, and even their breathing."
d_counseling_emma_19_3,"However, that means there are times I pick up on things I'd rather not know."
d_counseling_emma_19_4,That's a good skill to have.
d_counseling_emma_19_5,Just close your eyes and ignore it when that happens.
d_counseling_emma_19_6,Thanks!
d_counseling_emma_19_7,That's just what I wanted to hear.
d_counseling_emma_19_8,Thanks for cheering me up a little.
d_counseling_emma_19_9,Should I?
d_counseling_emma_19_10,Hmm... no. I don't think I can do that.
d_counseling_emma_19_11,Ignoring something and pretending it's not there just isn't my style.
d_counseling_emma_19_12,Emma gives me some pointers on how to read people.
d_counseling_emma_20_1,I'm thinking of throwing a party soon.
d_counseling_emma_20_2,What kind of snacks would you like there to be?
d_counseling_emma_20_3,I'll see if I can make anything special for you.
d_counseling_emma_20_4,Cake.
d_counseling_emma_20_5,Just coffee is fine.
d_counseling_emma_20_6,"Okay, let's see..."
d_counseling_emma_20_7,We'll start off with some salmon and Nutrium...
d_counseling_emma_20_8,and finish it all off with some ketchup!
d_counseling_emma_20_9,Coffee? Are you sure that'll be enough?
d_counseling_emma_20_10,"It's not hard to make,"
d_counseling_emma_20_11,"but I can't really put my own spin on it, which is a shame."
d_counseling_emma_20_12,Emma and I talk about the main tenets of cooking.
d_counseling_epinel_01_1,Hey. You know bubble gum?
d_counseling_epinel_01_2,What is your favorite flavor?
d_counseling_epinel_01_3,Peach.
d_counseling_epinel_01_4,Ginseng.
d_counseling_epinel_01_5,Epinel gives you a thumbs up.
d_counseling_epinel_01_6,"Neat choice, Coach."
d_counseling_epinel_01_7,...
d_counseling_epinel_01_8,"Just exactly how old are you, Coach?"
d_counseling_epinel_01_9,I discuss bubble gum preferences with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_02_1,"My hair is too long.
It's hard to dry after I take a shower."
d_counseling_epinel_02_2,Got any tips?
d_counseling_epinel_02_3,Get an industrial-strength hair dryer.
d_counseling_epinel_02_4,Come to my office. I can help you.
d_counseling_epinel_02_5,"Industrial-strength...
The kind the barbers use?"
d_counseling_epinel_02_6,"I'll... uh... try to find one, I guess."
d_counseling_epinel_02_7,!!
d_counseling_epinel_02_8,"OK, then. Tomorrow morning I'm showing up with towels and a hair dryer."
d_counseling_epinel_02_9,"You can't complain, either. It was your idea."
d_counseling_epinel_02_10,I listen to Epinel's troubles.
d_counseling_epinel_03_1,"Coach, give it to me straight."
d_counseling_epinel_03_2,Am I... short?
d_counseling_epinel_03_3,Not at all.
d_counseling_epinel_03_4,"The shorter, the cuter!"
d_counseling_epinel_03_5,"Yeah, right?"
d_counseling_epinel_03_6,"My size never gets in the way when I'm working out, anyway."
d_counseling_epinel_03_7,Uh...
d_counseling_epinel_03_8,Yeah. Cool. Thanks.
d_counseling_epinel_03_9,I listen to all of Epinel's troubles.
d_counseling_epinel_04_1,"Coach, do you ever get tired of being a Commander?"
d_counseling_epinel_04_2,All the time.
d_counseling_epinel_04_3,Never.
d_counseling_epinel_04_4,Oh. I thought you wouldn't.
d_counseling_epinel_04_5,"Well, anyway,
that makes me feel a little less alone."
d_counseling_epinel_04_6,I thought I was the only one who ever felt that way.
d_counseling_epinel_04_7,Whoa.
d_counseling_epinel_04_8,You're a real tough guy.
d_counseling_epinel_04_9,I listen to Epinel's various troubles.
d_counseling_epinel_05_1,"Coach, you free tomorrow?"
d_counseling_epinel_05_2,I have a big competition tomorrow at Nepenthe.
d_counseling_epinel_05_3,I'm busy.
d_counseling_epinel_05_4,I'll be there. I promise.
d_counseling_epinel_05_5,Huh. I get it.
d_counseling_epinel_05_6,Work always comes first for the Coach.
d_counseling_epinel_05_7,... Thank you.
d_counseling_epinel_05_8,"If Coach is really there, I'll definitely give it my best."
d_counseling_epinel_05_9,I have a meaningful conversation with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_06_1,What was it like to skateboard on the surface back in the day?
d_counseling_epinel_06_2,I wanna know what skateboarders were like back then.
d_counseling_epinel_06_3,Free as a bird.
d_counseling_epinel_06_4,No different from skateboarding in the Ark.
d_counseling_epinel_06_5,Hah. I knew it.
d_counseling_epinel_06_6,"That's why I keep fighting harder, day after day."
d_counseling_epinel_06_7,"I need to win back the place where I can skateboard,
free as a bird."
d_counseling_epinel_06_8,Huh.
d_counseling_epinel_06_9,"Coach could be happy anywhere, I guess."
d_counseling_epinel_06_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_07_1,"Coach, when we're done here, wanna come skateboard with me?"
d_counseling_epinel_07_2,There's a park by the gym.
d_counseling_epinel_07_3,Sure.
d_counseling_epinel_07_4,"Sorry, I'm just too busy."
d_counseling_epinel_07_5,Cool.
d_counseling_epinel_07_6,"It's got stairs with railings and benches.
Perfect place for skateboarding."
d_counseling_epinel_07_7,"Even better, nobody ever goes there. We can play until lights out."
d_counseling_epinel_07_8,...
d_counseling_epinel_07_9,Whatever. I get it.
d_counseling_epinel_07_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_08_1,Rumani is always bossing me around and telling me what to eat.
d_counseling_epinel_08_2,"She says I can't have any carbs...
and I have to take protein Splendamin four times a day."
d_counseling_epinel_08_3,That sounds like workplace bullying.
d_counseling_epinel_08_4,Do what she says. It's good advice.
d_counseling_epinel_08_5,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_epinel_08_6,I'll tell her off next time.
d_counseling_epinel_08_7,Coach...
d_counseling_epinel_08_8,"Well, I guess I walked right into that one."
d_counseling_epinel_08_9,I talk with Epinel about her squad members.
d_counseling_epinel_09_1,My fans always copy everything I do. It's such a drag.
d_counseling_epinel_09_2,"I know they're just kids,
but they need to learn to think for themselves, right?"
d_counseling_epinel_09_3,Teenagers only copy the coolest people.
d_counseling_epinel_09_4,Kids these days just don't know how to act.
d_counseling_epinel_09_5,...
d_counseling_epinel_09_6,"Whatever.
If you say so."
d_counseling_epinel_09_7,I really don't think it's a recent problem.
d_counseling_epinel_09_8,"From what I remember, kids have been like that since I debuted as a skateboarder."
d_counseling_epinel_09_9,I have a meaningful conversation with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_10_1,"Coach, have you ever... liked someone?"
d_counseling_epinel_10_2,Nope.
d_counseling_epinel_10_3,I'm still waiting.
d_counseling_epinel_10_4,Wha? Really?
d_counseling_epinel_10_5,And with so many cool Nikkes around you...
d_counseling_epinel_10_6,"You're really cold, Coach."
d_counseling_epinel_10_7,Waiting? For what?
d_counseling_epinel_10_8,"Hold on, you mean you still haven't met your special someone?"
d_counseling_epinel_10_9,"Well, good luck with that, Coach..."
d_counseling_epinel_10_10,I have a cozy chat with Epinel.
d_counseling_epinel_11_1,I feel like I've been stuck in a rut.
d_counseling_epinel_11_2,What do you usually do to pull yourself back up on your feet?
d_counseling_epinel_11_3,I face the problem head on until I overcome it.
d_counseling_epinel_11_4,I just wait and have faith that everything will work out in the end.
d_counseling_epinel_11_5,I see...
d_counseling_epinel_11_6,Right... it's better to take action
d_counseling_epinel_11_7,instead of sitting around waiting for the problem to solve itself.
d_counseling_epinel_11_8,I see...
d_counseling_epinel_11_9,But doesn't that make you more anxious?
d_counseling_epinel_11_10,Just waiting around without knowing when everything will be resolved?
d_counseling_epinel_11_11,Epinel and I talk more about feeling stuck in a rut.
d_counseling_epinel_12_1,I always carry bubble gum with me in my pocket.
d_counseling_epinel_12_2,What do you normally carry in your pockets?
d_counseling_epinel_12_3,Some candy or gum.
d_counseling_epinel_12_4,Money.
d_counseling_epinel_12_5,I actually get bored talking to you sometimes.
d_counseling_epinel_12_6,We're too similar.
d_counseling_epinel_12_7,How about I trade you some of my gum for your candy?
d_counseling_epinel_12_8,"Yep, you're an adult all right. Not a fun-loving bone in your body."
d_counseling_epinel_12_9,"During our discussion, Epinel and I show each other the contents of our pockets."
d_counseling_epinel_13_1,"If we ever end up reclaiming the surface,"
d_counseling_epinel_13_2,what's the first thing you would do?
d_counseling_epinel_13_3,Experience my first moment of freedom skateboarding with you up on the surface.
d_counseling_epinel_13_4,"Since the fight would finally be over, I'd enjoy some long overdue R&R."
d_counseling_epinel_13_5,Nice!
d_counseling_epinel_13_6,You'll probably know your way around a board by then.
d_counseling_epinel_13_7,I hope that day comes sooner rather than later.
d_counseling_epinel_13_8,Right... you're always being put through the wringer.
d_counseling_epinel_13_9,"I'll kick back and relax too, then."
d_counseling_epinel_13_10,"But you have to promise to go skateboarding with me once you're finished resting, okay?"
d_counseling_epinel_13_11,Epinel and I spend more time imaging our plans for the future.
d_counseling_epinel_14_1,"Hey, check it out! I invented a new trick."
d_counseling_epinel_14_2,What do you think I should call it?
d_counseling_epinel_14_3,"First off, what's the trick?"
d_counseling_epinel_14_4,Triple kickflip nollie shuvit.
d_counseling_epinel_14_5,"Oh right, I forgot to tell you."
d_counseling_epinel_14_6,Good thing you reminded me!
d_counseling_epinel_14_7,"It's nothing too crazy, just a basic trick."
d_counseling_epinel_14_8,"It's a brilliant name,"
d_counseling_epinel_14_9,but I don't think it really goes well with the trick.
d_counseling_epinel_14_10,"Now that I think about it, I never told you what the trick was!"
d_counseling_epinel_14_11,Epinel and I try to come up with a good name for her new skateboarding trick.
d_counseling_epinel_15_1,I've been thinking about buying a new skateboard to practice on.
d_counseling_epinel_15_2,"Should I buy one that's nice and simple, or one that's all tricked out?"
d_counseling_epinel_15_3,They're both the same brand.
d_counseling_epinel_15_4,One that's simple.
d_counseling_epinel_15_5,One that's tricked out.
d_counseling_epinel_15_6,You think so?
d_counseling_epinel_15_7,"I always ride the same type of skateboard,"
d_counseling_epinel_15_8,so I was thinking about buying something different to practice on.
d_counseling_epinel_15_9,"But then again, something simple should get the job done."
d_counseling_epinel_15_10,I'm worried that it might be a little too much for me.
d_counseling_epinel_15_11,"Still, I always ride the same type of skateboard, so"
d_counseling_epinel_15_12,it might be okay if I'm just using it to practice on.
d_counseling_epinel_15_13,I try to guide Epinel through her conundrum over the design of her skateboard.
d_counseling_epinel_16_1,People expect a lot from me.
d_counseling_epinel_16_2,"I want to live up to those high expectations, so I always push things to the limit."
d_counseling_epinel_16_3,That mindset is what got you to where you are today.
d_counseling_epinel_16_4,Just be careful. You might end up hurting yourself one day.
d_counseling_epinel_16_5,... Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_epinel_16_6,"You're right, it's that very mindset that"
d_counseling_epinel_16_7,got me this far.
d_counseling_epinel_16_8,My only worry is that I'll fall into another slump
d_counseling_epinel_16_9,if I take my foot off the gas for even an instant.
d_counseling_epinel_16_10,Epinel and I have a serious conversation.
d_counseling_epinel_17_1,I'd like to go head to head with Sugar. My skateboard versus her motorcycle.
d_counseling_epinel_17_2,"I know full well she'll smoke me, but I think it'd be fun, don't you?"
d_counseling_epinel_17_3,"I think if you put your mind to it, you might win."
d_counseling_epinel_17_4,It'll be a race for the ages.
d_counseling_epinel_17_5,"Thank you for saying that,"
d_counseling_epinel_17_6,but I still don't see it happening.
d_counseling_epinel_17_7,How can a skateboard edge out a motorcycle?
d_counseling_epinel_17_8,You think so?
d_counseling_epinel_17_9,Maybe I'll make it an exhibition match in the next competition.
d_counseling_epinel_17_10,"You have to come to watch, Coach."
d_counseling_epinel_17_11,Epinel and I imagine what it would be like for her to race against Sugar.
d_counseling_epinel_18_1,"Coach, I need something right away. Can you guess what it is?"
d_counseling_epinel_18_2,Shoes.
d_counseling_epinel_18_3,skateboard.
d_counseling_epinel_18_4,I knew you'd figure it out.
d_counseling_epinel_18_5,I tore up my shoes again during practice.
d_counseling_epinel_18_6,"I'm gonna go buy a pair later, want to come with me?"
d_counseling_epinel_18_7,"Nope. Fortunately, my skateboard is fine."
d_counseling_epinel_18_8,"I did, however, ruin another pair of shoes during practice."
d_counseling_epinel_18_9,I'll have to buy another pair later.
d_counseling_epinel_18_10,Epinel and I talk about what new shoes she'll buy.
d_counseling_epinel_19_1,"I can be pouring sweat, but as soon as I'm on my skateboard, all the wind dries the sweat off."
d_counseling_epinel_19_2,You think I should tell Folkwang to give skateboarding a try?
d_counseling_epinel_19_3,I think it's a great idea.
d_counseling_epinel_19_4,I don't think that's a good idea.
d_counseling_epinel_19_5,Perfect. I'll have her swing by during one of my practice sessions.
d_counseling_epinel_19_6,She'll probably end up sweating up a storm and quitting.
d_counseling_epinel_19_7,But you never know.
d_counseling_epinel_19_8,"Yeah, it would take a while to teach her."
d_counseling_epinel_19_9,"Not only that, she'd have to be motivated to do it as well."
d_counseling_epinel_19_10,"Oh well, it was a nice thought."
d_counseling_epinel_19_11,Epinel and I discuss whether or not skateboarding will help Folkwang with her excessive perspiration.
d_counseling_epinel_20_1,"The more people there are that get into skateboarding,"
d_counseling_epinel_20_2,the more injuries start piling up.
d_counseling_epinel_20_3,You think there's any way to counteract that problem?
d_counseling_epinel_20_4,Have everyone wear safety gear.
d_counseling_epinel_20_5,Limit the purchase of skateboards.
d_counseling_epinel_20_6,That's a good idea.
d_counseling_epinel_20_7,"If you're padded up, the chances of you injuring yourself go way down."
d_counseling_epinel_20_8,I'll slap on some safety gear for a while too.
d_counseling_epinel_20_9,Are you sure that won't make skateboarding too inaccessible?
d_counseling_epinel_20_10,"I don't want to cut people off from the sport entirely,"
d_counseling_epinel_20_11,I just want them to be able to ride safely...
d_counseling_epinel_20_12,Epinel and I talked more about skateboarding safety.
d_counseling_ether_01_1,"No. 7, which flavor do you prefer: strawberry or orange?"
d_counseling_ether_01_2,Strawberry.
d_counseling_ether_01_3,Orange.
d_counseling_ether_01_4,"Hm, is that so?"
d_counseling_ether_01_5,"Strawberry it is, then."
d_counseling_ether_01_6,I hope you don't live to regret it.
d_counseling_ether_01_7,Orange?
d_counseling_ether_01_8,Hmm... Okay.
d_counseling_ether_01_9,Turns out No. 7 really is a lucky guy.
d_counseling_ether_01_10,"One orange flavor, coming right up."
d_counseling_ether_01_11,Much better than strawberry.
d_counseling_ether_01_12,I talk with Ether about medicines and their tastes.
d_counseling_ether_02_1,I figured I'd better ask you...
d_counseling_ether_02_2,Do you like me calling you No. 7?
d_counseling_ether_02_3,I like it.
d_counseling_ether_02_4,I don't like it. Make up something else.
d_counseling_ether_02_5,Good.
d_counseling_ether_02_6,"Not that it matters, though. I wouldn't change your nickname just because you didn't like it."
d_counseling_ether_02_7,No can do.
d_counseling_ether_02_8,I asked if you liked it. I didn't say anything about changing it.
d_counseling_ether_02_9,"You're No. 7 to me, and that's that."
d_counseling_ether_02_10,I'm sure you'll warm up to your number in time.
d_counseling_ether_02_11,I talk with Ether about her fondness for numbers.
d_counseling_ether_03_1,"""Science is for the betterment of humankind."""
d_counseling_ether_03_2,Do you know that phrase?
d_counseling_ether_03_3,"Yes, I do."
d_counseling_ether_03_4,Never heard it before.
d_counseling_ether_03_5,I'm glad.
d_counseling_ether_03_6,As long as each experiment that I conduct
d_counseling_ether_03_7,"is for the sake of humankind,"
d_counseling_ether_03_8,"you'll be willing to look the other way, right?"
d_counseling_ether_03_9,That's fine.
d_counseling_ether_03_10,Don't worry about it. Forget I brought it up.
d_counseling_ether_03_11,"You're kinda cute sometimes, you know that?"
d_counseling_ether_03_12,I talk with Ether about science.
d_counseling_ether_04_1,"Hey, No.7."
d_counseling_ether_04_2,How would you feel if I used you as a test subject for some dangerous experiments?
d_counseling_ether_04_3,Just give me a heads-up beforehand.
d_counseling_ether_04_4,I don't believe you'd do something like that.
d_counseling_ether_04_5,You actually think I'd do that to you?
d_counseling_ether_04_6,That makes me a little sad.
d_counseling_ether_04_7,"I always think I take pretty good care of you, in my own special way."
d_counseling_ether_04_8,Precisely! How could I ever subject my precious No. 7 to experiments like that?
d_counseling_ether_04_9,I'm glad you have so much faith in me. Don't let that change.
d_counseling_ether_04_10,"No matter what I tell you to do, you have to do it, because you trust me. Right?"
d_counseling_ether_04_11,I tell Ether not to carry out any more dangerous experiments.
d_counseling_ether_05_1,Have you ever heard the scary story about the library?
d_counseling_ether_05_2,"Every night, way back at the faaar end of the bookshelves,"
d_counseling_ether_05_3,you can hear someone wailing.
d_counseling_ether_05_4,Does that kind of story... interest you?
d_counseling_ether_05_5,Yes.
d_counseling_ether_05_6,No.
d_counseling_ether_05_7,Oh? Then allow me to remind you:
d_counseling_ether_05_8,Curiosity killed the cat.
d_counseling_ether_05_9,"So let's make sure kitty no. 7 doesn't get too curious, OK?"
d_counseling_ether_05_10,No? Really?
d_counseling_ether_05_11,"No. 7 is a brave guy, isn't he?"
d_counseling_ether_05_12,Or maybe he's just more cautious than most people.
d_counseling_ether_05_13,"Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll be able to avoid all kinds of untimely deaths."
d_counseling_ether_05_14,I talk about creepy ghost stories with Ether.
d_counseling_ether_06_1,How does Syuen always stay so alert?
d_counseling_ether_06_2,It's fascinating.
d_counseling_ether_06_3,"I'd like to give Syuen her own subject number,"
d_counseling_ether_06_4,but I figured you wouldn't want me to. Unless...?
d_counseling_ether_06_5,Not happening.
d_counseling_ether_06_6,I think it's a great idea.
d_counseling_ether_06_7,Meh. What a bummer.
d_counseling_ether_06_8,I'm positive Syuen would produce a plethora of intriguing results.
d_counseling_ether_06_9,Oh well. C'est la vie.
d_counseling_ether_06_10,You agree with me?
d_counseling_ether_06_11,How come? Are you excited to be around another fellow test subject?
d_counseling_ether_06_12,This is all so exciting!
d_counseling_ether_06_13,I promise I'll try my very best.
d_counseling_ether_06_14,Ether and I talk about Syuen.
d_counseling_ether_07_1,Most people freak out when they see an operating room or a lab table.
d_counseling_ether_07_2,Do you think there's any way to make them less intimidating?
d_counseling_ether_07_3,Play some exciting music.
d_counseling_ether_07_4,Tranquilize people before bringing them in.
d_counseling_ether_07_5,No.
d_counseling_ether_07_6,I don't like that. Bad idea.
d_counseling_ether_07_7,Tranquilize them?
d_counseling_ether_07_8,Nice. I'll keep that in mind.
d_counseling_ether_07_9,I spend time with Ether talking about the operating room.
d_counseling_ether_08_1,"No. 7, you know that I think about you a lot, don't you?"
d_counseling_ether_08_2,It's only natural to look after your test subjects and make sure they're healthy.
d_counseling_ether_08_3,"No, I didn't know that."
d_counseling_ether_08_4,"Yes, but that's not the only reason."
d_counseling_ether_08_5,I have a real affection for you.
d_counseling_ether_08_6,I'm not as scary as the others make me out to be.
d_counseling_ether_08_7,You don't? But I've done so much for you!
d_counseling_ether_08_8,"Well, it can't be helped. I'll just have to provide you with a bit more care."
d_counseling_ether_08_9,I talk more with Ether about how she shows affection.
d_counseling_ether_09_1,I've heard that one of your Nikkes
d_counseling_ether_09_2,may have had their DNA mixed with that of a dog?
d_counseling_ether_09_3,Is that true?
d_counseling_ether_09_4,"No. She's just as adorable as a puppy dog, that's all."
d_counseling_ether_09_5,...
d_counseling_ether_09_6,Is that so?
d_counseling_ether_09_7,That's a shame.
d_counseling_ether_09_8,She could have made for a very intriguing test subject.
d_counseling_ether_09_9,Why are you being so quiet?
d_counseling_ether_09_10,"Oh, so that kind of Nikke really does exist?"
d_counseling_ether_09_11,Don't worry. I won't ask you her name.
d_counseling_ether_09_12,I can find that out myself.
d_counseling_ether_09_13,I try very hard to pull Ether's attention away from Poli.
d_counseling_ether_10_1,"No.7, have you ever been to the Outer Rim?"
d_counseling_ether_10_2,Yes.
d_counseling_ether_10_3,No.
d_counseling_ether_10_4,How was it?
d_counseling_ether_10_5,"It's incredible, right?"
d_counseling_ether_10_6,So many new subjects for my experiments...
d_counseling_ether_10_7,"The next time you go, can you bring me with you?"
d_counseling_ether_10_8,No?
d_counseling_ether_10_9,You really should check it out sometime.
d_counseling_ether_10_10,You can find all sorts of useful things over there.
d_counseling_ether_10_11,I talk with Ether about the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_ether_11_1,*Yawn* I'm pooped.
d_counseling_ether_11_2,"I've been pulling some all-nighters for the past few days,"
d_counseling_ether_11_3,and now I don't feel like doing much of anything.
d_counseling_ether_11_4,Then don't do anything.
d_counseling_ether_11_5,Develop a medication that will give you some energy.
d_counseling_ether_11_6,But there's still so much left to do.
d_counseling_ether_11_7,"I need to buy new stockings, and"
d_counseling_ether_11_8,I have to send the research data to Mana...
d_counseling_ether_11_9,Ugh... I'm just not feeling it.
d_counseling_ether_11_10,That's...
d_counseling_ether_11_11,not a bad idea!
d_counseling_ether_11_12,...
d_counseling_ether_11_13,I can formulate something exclusively for Nikkes to use.
d_counseling_ether_11_14,I can have it send a signal to the...
d_counseling_ether_11_15,"Anyway, I'll think about this more after I have a nice lie down."
d_counseling_ether_11_16,I take care of the tasks Ether doesn't have the energy to finish.
d_counseling_ether_12_1,"You know how people say the more bitter medicine tastes, the better it is for you?"
d_counseling_ether_12_2,Do you think there's any truth to that?
d_counseling_ether_12_3,I think so.
d_counseling_ether_12_4,That's just an old wives' tale.
d_counseling_ether_12_5,You really think so?
d_counseling_ether_12_6,Seriously?
d_counseling_ether_12_7,I'll make this medicine as bitter as possible for you then.
d_counseling_ether_12_8,"Hmm... If you thought there was an element of truth to it,"
d_counseling_ether_12_9,I was going to put it to the test and have you take some of this bitter medicine.
d_counseling_ether_12_10,You talked your way out of this one!
d_counseling_ether_12_11,Ether and I talk about medication and whether its taste has any effect on the body.
d_counseling_ether_13_1,What's a food you're craving?
d_counseling_ether_13_2,I'll make it for you.
d_counseling_ether_13_3,"If you want to give me some medicine, just say so."
d_counseling_ether_13_4,I'm willing to eat anything.
d_counseling_ether_13_5,"Perceptive, as always!"
d_counseling_ether_13_6,I've just got some supplements I wanted you to try out.
d_counseling_ether_13_7,"I'm glad you're willing to try them,"
d_counseling_ether_13_8,because I didn't feel like cooking anything.
d_counseling_ether_13_9,Really? Whatever I make?
d_counseling_ether_13_10,"All right, I don't want to hear any bellyaching when I feed you!"
d_counseling_ether_13_11,You got that?
d_counseling_ether_13_12,Ether and I debate over whether the flavor of food is important.
d_counseling_ether_14_1,This is so frustrating!
d_counseling_ether_14_2,Why isn't my research proceeding smoothly?
d_counseling_ether_14_3,Have I been overthinking it?
d_counseling_ether_14_4,Go and get some sleep.
d_counseling_ether_14_5,"Just keep at it, you're bound to come up with a solution sooner or later."
d_counseling_ether_14_6,I can't do that!
d_counseling_ether_14_7,Our research deadline is just around the corner.
d_counseling_ether_14_8,I can't waste any time catching 40 winks.
d_counseling_ether_14_9,"I need to rack my brain to come up with a solution, even if it drives me up a wall."
d_counseling_ether_14_10,I see you're not one the most sympathetic person around...
d_counseling_ether_14_11,But... you're right.
d_counseling_ether_14_12,"If my research has hit a snag, I need to rack my brain until I come up with a solution."
d_counseling_ether_14_13,"You really know your stuff, No. 7!"
d_counseling_ether_14_14,I listened a little longer to Ether as she vented.
d_counseling_ether_15_1,I've been pondering if there is any way of overcoming one's deficiencies.
d_counseling_ether_15_2,"What are your thoughts on this issue, No. 7?"
d_counseling_ether_15_3,"If you put your mind to it, you can overcome any deficiency you have."
d_counseling_ether_15_4,Science can help you overcome any deficiency.
d_counseling_ether_15_5,Effort?
d_counseling_ether_15_6,You mean like willpower? I'm surprised to hear you believe in such an unscientific concept.
d_counseling_ether_15_7,I don't believe in anything unscientific so I can't stand hearing people go on about willpower.
d_counseling_ether_15_8,You're right about that.
d_counseling_ether_15_9,Science can overcome anything.
d_counseling_ether_15_10,It's all thanks to science that we were able to take normal girls
d_counseling_ether_15_11,with no previous combat experience and turn them into killing machines.
d_counseling_ether_15_12,Ether and I debate more on science versus willpower.
d_counseling_ether_16_1,Sigh... Look how nice it is outside...
d_counseling_ether_16_2,Days like this make me want to turn in my two weeks notice.
d_counseling_ether_16_3,"If you quit, what will you do about money?"
d_counseling_ether_16_4,"If you quit, think about all the research that will go unfunded."
d_counseling_ether_16_5,"Right, I won't be getting a paycheck anymore..."
d_counseling_ether_16_6,"Fine, you have a point. Money is important."
d_counseling_ether_16_7,That's not why I'm deciding to stay though.
d_counseling_ether_16_8,!!!
d_counseling_ether_16_9,What is going on here?
d_counseling_ether_16_10,How do you know so much about me?
d_counseling_ether_16_11,That's exactly why I could never leave this job.
d_counseling_ether_16_12,Ether once again gave up her thoughts of turning in her resignation letter.
d_counseling_ether_17_1,Hmmm...
d_counseling_ether_17_2,Hmmm...
d_counseling_ether_17_3,Do you have something to say to me?
d_counseling_ether_17_4,I don't want to get on the lab table just yet.
d_counseling_ether_17_5,What? It's nothing.
d_counseling_ether_17_6,"I've grown fonder of you, so I was just staring."
d_counseling_ether_17_7,Nothing to be nervous about.
d_counseling_ether_17_8,You catch on fast!
d_counseling_ether_17_9,You could be right. Perhaps putting you on the lab table right now
d_counseling_ether_17_10,would be a little premature.
d_counseling_ether_17_11,I tried to dissuade Ether from conducting experiments on me.
d_counseling_ether_18_1,Rip... rip!
d_counseling_ether_18_2,Aw man! My stockings ripped again.
d_counseling_ether_18_3,Sigh...
d_counseling_ether_18_4,Let me guess... You don't feel like buying new ones.
d_counseling_ether_18_5,You must be really irritated.
d_counseling_ether_18_6,!!
d_counseling_ether_18_7,Bingo!
d_counseling_ether_18_8,Soooo... could you go buy me some new stockings?
d_counseling_ether_18_9,I really don't want to go...
d_counseling_ether_18_10,Not necessarily.
d_counseling_ether_18_11,I just don't feel like going out to buy new ones.
d_counseling_ether_18_12,"Since you didn't get it right,"
d_counseling_ether_18_13,can you go buy me some new stockings?
d_counseling_ether_18_14,I went to buy some stockings for Ether since she didn't feel like doing it herself.
d_counseling_ether_19_1,"NO.7, have you been taking good care of yourself?"
d_counseling_ether_19_2,Let me know if you're not feeling well. I'll prescribe you some medicine.
d_counseling_ether_19_3,... That won't be necessary.
d_counseling_ether_19_4,Um... sure. Got it. Don't worry about me.
d_counseling_ether_19_5,Why do you look so weirded out?
d_counseling_ether_19_6,I'm going out of my way to be nice to you!
d_counseling_ether_19_7,"If that's how you show gratitude, maybe I'll send you the wrong medicine to teach you a lesson."
d_counseling_ether_19_8,What is it? Why are you so nervous?
d_counseling_ether_19_9,At least you didn't turn me down.
d_counseling_ether_19_10,"If you had, I might have ended up using it against you."
d_counseling_ether_19_11,You're as sharp as a tack!
d_counseling_ether_19_12,Ether and I talk about how we look after our health.
d_counseling_ether_20_1,"They have no basis in science, but do you believe in ghosts?"
d_counseling_ether_20_2,I believe ghosts exist.
d_counseling_ether_20_3,Of course there's no such thing as ghosts.
d_counseling_ether_20_4,Really? Hmmm...
d_counseling_ether_20_5,I'd like to think there are ghosts out there.
d_counseling_ether_20_6,"After all, if that was the case,"
d_counseling_ether_20_7,I'd be surrounded by ghosts all the time.
d_counseling_ether_20_8,Then I could catch them and conduct all sorts of experiments on them!
d_counseling_ether_20_9,Do you know how much fun that would be? Sigh...too bad they're not real.
d_counseling_ether_20_10,Obviously. It's ridiculous to think something like ghosts could actually exist.
d_counseling_ether_20_11,I just thought it was an interesting question to ask.
d_counseling_ether_20_12,Don't read too much into it.
d_counseling_ether_20_13,Ether and I end up swapping ghost stories.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_1,Why are all these Commanders
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_2,so incompetent?
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_3,They're the result of ineffectual Military Academies.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_4,It seems that way because you're in a different league entirely.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_5,... Tsk.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_6,You're always putting the blame on someone or something else.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_7,That's why you're all so inferior.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_8,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_9,"Comparatively speaking, I suppose you're right."
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_10,But I don't think that's the whole story.
d_counseling_eunhwa_01_11,I was able to understand Eunhwa better through our chat.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_1,Vesti has potential.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_2,"Yet, she ignores my orders and her zeal for battle can cause her to lose control."
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_3,I need a way to bring Vesti to her senses. To humble her.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_4,Read Vesti's personal diary out loud in a meeting.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_5,Just be patient with her.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_6,... Talk about ruthless.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_7,"With this approach, only two results are possible:
Total success, or disastrous failure."
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_8,Let's try it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_9,... You absolute fool.
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_10,"I didn't come here for brainless, feel-good advice."
d_counseling_eunhwa_02_11,Eunhwa's reactions helped me understand her better.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_1,Emma keeps trying to get me and Vesti to spend time together.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_2,I don't know how to refuse.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_3,Why not just be friendly with Vesti?
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_4,Use work as an excuse.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_5,Worthless.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_6,Why would I want to get involved with that monster outside of a mission?
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_7,*Sigh*
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_8,That's what I've been doing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_9,"However, that excuse won't hold up forever. Hmph..."
d_counseling_eunhwa_03_10,I was able to understand Eunhwa's relationship with others better.
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_1,When do you think we'll be able to reclaim
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_2,the surface world?
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_3,Within my lifetime.
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_4,"Right now, it's not looking promising."
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_5,... I admire your confidence.
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_6,I suppose it's better than nothing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_7,Oh?
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_8,"So when the going gets tough you just give up, is that it? I can't believe you..."
d_counseling_eunhwa_04_9,I have a meaningful conversation with Eunhwa.
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_1,You know...
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_2,Emma has been giving me all these massages lately. She says it's for stress relief.
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_3,I... I'm not quite sure how to process it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_4,Enjoy it while you can.
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_5,"If you don't like it, turn her down politely."
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_6,... What?
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_7,Are you... the same as Emma?
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_9,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_10,I can't refuse Emma.
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_11,"I'm not the only one, either. No one can say no to her."
d_counseling_eunhwa_05_12,I was able to understand Eunhwa's relationships with others better.
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_1,Nope. Not today. Keep  your mouth shut.
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_2,I don't feel like talking to a fool like you!
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_3,What's gotten into you?
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_4,Did you run into Rapi on the way here?
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_5,"Nothing, I just ran into some riffraff on the way over."
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_6,"Looks like I'm not done dealing with riffraff today, either..."
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_8,... I ought to punch you in the face.
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_9,How dare you speak her name in front of me?!
d_counseling_eunhwa_06_10,We spend some time in awkward silence.
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_1,Absolute or Matis?
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_2,Which squad is the strongest?
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_3,"Everyone's been talking about it. Tell me, what are your thoughts?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_4,"Absolute, of course."
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_5,It's hard to beat Matis' technology.
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_6,Of course you would say that...
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_7,"But, you might actually not be as stupid as you look."
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_8,"Pssh, do you really think strength is determined by technology alone?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_9,The important thing is how you use that technology.
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_10,"When it comes to that, you all get a big fat zero. Goose egg. It's no wonder your perspective is so distorted."
d_counseling_eunhwa_07_11,I talk with Eunhwa about the concept of strength.
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_1,There is no weather in the Ark.
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_2,I find this somewhat depressing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_3,"If it's weather you want, we can just go up to the surface for a minute."
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_4,We'll enjoy all four seasons once we reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_5,... Have you completely lost your little mind?
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_6,"The surface is a war zone.
You could get blown to smithereens by a laser beam in the blink of an eye."
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_7,"Now you're saying you want to go up just to enjoy the weather?
The depths of your stupidity continue to astound me."
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_8,...!!
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_9,"Now, that's quite a coincidence."
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_10,I was thinking the exact same thing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_08_11,I have a meaningful conversation with Eunhwa.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_1,What should we do with the defectives on the team
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_2,who aren't pulling their weight?
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_3,Discover their talents and play to their strengths.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_4,Have more capable team members help them out.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_5,"Right. While our best option would simply be to replace them,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_6,we often have no choice but to keep them on the team.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_7,"In this situation, your suggestion is reasonable."
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_8,Tell me. Do you even have a brain between those ears of yours?
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_9,The entire team must operate on the same wavelength.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_10,We can't change our strategy just to babysit children who couldn't even wipe their own butts.
d_counseling_eunhwa_09_11,I talk with Eunhwa about team organization.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_1,Tell me. How do you define comradery?
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_2,It's an unbreakable sense of trust. You can entrust the other person with anything.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_3,It's a sense of loyalty that lasts forever.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_4,Oh? That means nothing to me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_5,The only person I can rely on is myself.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_6,"The moment I put too much trust in someone else, I could lose everything."
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_7,... That's true.
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_8,"No matter what happens, it means nothing if you have no one by your side at the end of it."
d_counseling_eunhwa_10_9,I talk with Eunhwa about the meaning of comradery.
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_1,I'm not in a talking mood today.
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_2,I'd prefer to rest.
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_3,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_4,Is something on your mind?
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_5,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_6,You hear that? Silence. I love it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_7,Would you shut up?
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_8,I can't relax with you constantly badgering in my ear.
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_9,"So please, if you'd be so kind... shut it."
d_counseling_eunhwa_11_10,Eunhwa and I spend some time together in silence.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_1,What's your stance on mistakes?
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_2,Everyone makes them.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_3,Even the smallest mistake could spell disaster.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_4,"I don't disagree,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_5,but I'd rather not have someone like that around me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_6,"Exactly right. Most people would prattle on how everyone makes mistakes, but"
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_7,there are some situations where you simply can't afford to take any missteps.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_8,I can't believe I'm saying this...but we actually agree on something.
d_counseling_eunhwa_12_9,Eunhwa and I have a conversation about times when there's no room for error.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_1,Eat it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_2,...　Did Emma make this?
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_3,No.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_4,You're not as stupid as you look.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_5,She asked me to make sure you ate every last bit of it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_6,So dig in.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_7,I'm not asking. I'm telling you.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_8,Eat it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_13_9,"I have a ""delicious"" meal with Eunhwa."
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_1,The Outpost wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for all the mouthbreathers stumbling about.
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_2,What's the one location here you couldn't do without?
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_3,The armory.
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_4,The Toy Store.
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_5,A fine answer.
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_6,"Considering that's where all the weapons and supplies are stored, it's a very important place."
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_7,Make sure you keep everything in good order.
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_8,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_9,What can I even say to such a ridiculous response?
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_10,How much longer do you intend on disappointing me?
d_counseling_eunhwa_14_11,Eunhwa and I talked about various other locations in the Outpost.
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_1,"If you encountered heavy enemy resistance en route to your target location,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_2,what would you do?
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_3,"I'd pull back before they noticed me, and report it to my superiors."
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_4,"Once you've encountered the enemy, you must engage. I would fight until the very end."
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_5,Very wise. It is best to retreat
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_6,when you're outmanned and outgunned.
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_7,More than a few Commanders have paid for such bravado with their life.
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_8,I'm disappointed to hear you harbor the same foolish thoughts.
d_counseling_eunhwa_15_9,Eunhwa and I debated on which tactics work best up on the surface.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_1,"It's utterly puerile, but people often form attachments to the most useless things."
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_2,Please don't tell me you feel that way about anything.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_3,I'm incredibly attached to this doll that I cuddle up with when I sleep.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_4,My identification badge.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_5,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_6,... I can't even begin to understand that. Is it because...
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_7,No. I don't even want to understand.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_8,That's far from useless.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_9,It's an important document that differentiates commanders from ordinary civilians.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_10,You must take good care of it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_16_11,"During our conversation, Eunhwa and I talked about all sorts of various items."
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_1,My mind feels so cluttered.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_2,I need to find a way to clear my head.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_3,Take some alone time and organize your thoughts.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_4,Distract yourself by doing various tasks.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_5,The entire reason I'm in this mess is that I can't handle it on my own.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_6,... I shouldn't have said anything.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_7,"Thanks to you, my mind is even more of a disaster zone now."
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_8,That's a good idea.
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_9,"When we're done here, I want you to go to the training room with me."
d_counseling_eunhwa_17_10,I have a conversation with Eunhwa about emptying your mind.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_1,"After a few days of rations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...it can be rough going."
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_2,"You don't have anything else to eat by any chance, do you?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_3,Hand over the apple from the surface that you have been saving.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_4,Hand her some apple-flavored Splendamin
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_5,It looked like it pained you to give this to me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_6,You must have paid an arm and a leg for it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_7,... Thank you.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_8,Thanks.
d_counseling_eunhwa_18_9,Eunhwa and I talked more about food.
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_1,"Commanders look after the mental well-being of their Nikkes,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_2,but does anybody pay attention to your state of mind?
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_3,Commanders are on their own in that regard.
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_4,I don't really need anyone's help anyway. I feel fine.
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_5,"I'm sure I don't have to tell you this,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_6,"but if you end up having a mental breakdown, then that's all she wrote."
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_7,Just don't act like a weakling and keep doing what you're doing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_8,Don't be ridiculous.
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_9,"if you end up having a mental breakdown, then that's all she wrote."
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_10,When are you going to wise up?
d_counseling_eunhwa_19_11,Eunhwa and I have a conversation about one's mental wellbeing.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_1,"Hey, out of the new bunch of recruits,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_2,is there any worth a damn?
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_3,Not a single one.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_4,Three or four of them caught my eye.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_5,Are you sure about that?
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_6,I saw one or two that could crack a few Rapture skulls.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_7,You don't have an eye for this at all.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_8,"From now on, I'll just handle it myself."
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_9,I'm pretty sure I agree with you.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_10,I'll let you take it from here.
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_11,"I'll make a list and send it your way, so keep an eye out."
d_counseling_eunhwa_20_12,I spend some time with Eunhwa selecting the new Nikke recruits.
d_counseling_exia_01_1,"Hey, Noob."
d_counseling_exia_01_2,I have a friend who can't game to save their life.
d_counseling_exia_01_3,Their complete lack of skill frustrates me greatly during raids.
d_counseling_exia_01_4,I seek your advice on this.
d_counseling_exia_01_5,Just be patient and look after them.
d_counseling_exia_01_6,Are you talking about me?
d_counseling_exia_01_7,*Stare*
d_counseling_exia_01_8,Affirmative.
d_counseling_exia_01_9,Ah! Finally saying this to your face relieves me greatly.
d_counseling_exia_01_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_02_1,People keep telling me to speak with caution.
d_counseling_exia_02_2,"But, what's wrong with stating simple facts?"
d_counseling_exia_02_3,The truth can be hurtful sometimes.
d_counseling_exia_02_4,"Don't back down, no matter what other people say."
d_counseling_exia_02_5,Hm.
d_counseling_exia_02_6,"Nevertheless, we all must face the facts eventually."
d_counseling_exia_02_7,Exceptional!
d_counseling_exia_02_8,Your answer befits a Commander. I am glad to hear it!
d_counseling_exia_02_9,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_03_1,"Hey Noob, do you prefer 2D or 3D?"
d_counseling_exia_03_2,I don't understand the question.
d_counseling_exia_03_3,"2D, for sure."
d_counseling_exia_03_4,"Wait, what?"
d_counseling_exia_03_5,"I thought you were a gamer, Noob!"
d_counseling_exia_03_6,I see.
d_counseling_exia_03_7,Your answer is completely within my expectation.
d_counseling_exia_03_8,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_04_1,I have a teammate who never stops speaking.
d_counseling_exia_04_3,How should I resolve the situation?
d_counseling_exia_04_4,Get noise canceling headphones.
d_counseling_exia_04_5,Just grin and bear it.
d_counseling_exia_04_6,!!
d_counseling_exia_04_7,Good advice. You have my gratitude.
d_counseling_exia_04_8,... Your solution is unacceptable.
d_counseling_exia_04_9,"With continued exposure, I may develop neurological damage..."
d_counseling_exia_04_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_05_1,I understand the necessity of regular Guild meet-ups.
d_counseling_exia_05_2,"However, I do not enjoy seeing people offline.
Please propose a solution."
d_counseling_exia_05_3,Have the meet-ups online.
d_counseling_exia_05_4,"I can go with you, if you like."
d_counseling_exia_05_5,This answer is acceptable.
d_counseling_exia_05_6,"However, what's the point of a meet-up if it's online?"
d_counseling_exia_05_7,Hm...
d_counseling_exia_05_8,I believe I would find your presence most enjoyable.
d_counseling_exia_05_9,I talk with Exia about setting up regular meet-ups for the Guild.
d_counseling_exia_06_1,"Unacceptable.
Unacceptable."
d_counseling_exia_06_2,All games have become boring to me.
d_counseling_exia_06_3,I think I may be becoming desensitized to games.
d_counseling_exia_06_4,"Let's stop the game, then."
d_counseling_exia_06_5,You'll feel better after a day or two.
d_counseling_exia_06_6,...
d_counseling_exia_06_7,Ah. My condition has already improved considerably.
d_counseling_exia_06_8,"Noob, are you telling me"
d_counseling_exia_06_9,that you can see the future? I suppose we will see.
d_counseling_exia_06_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_07_1,I have uncovered someone's dirty secret.
d_counseling_exia_07_2,What is the optimal course of action?
d_counseling_exia_07_3,Play dumb.
d_counseling_exia_07_4,Tell them about it and say you're sorry for snooping.
d_counseling_exia_07_5,...
d_counseling_exia_07_6,Greetings. I am but a simple Nikke who knows nothing.
d_counseling_exia_07_7,"Then, I...
I apologize."
d_counseling_exia_07_8,"A few days ago, I was collecting information on graduates from your military academy."
d_counseling_exia_07_9,"By chance, I acquired a copy of your graduation thesis and read it... It was terrible."
d_counseling_exia_07_10,The time Exia and I spend together is rather awkward.
d_counseling_exia_08_1,Novel keeps locking my shower door.
d_counseling_exia_08_2,Apparently she believes she is trying to solve a murder. Her actions are unbearable.
d_counseling_exia_08_3,You are the one who is in control here. I require your assistance. Please!
d_counseling_exia_08_4,You can use the shower in my room.
d_counseling_exia_08_5,Install a large window in your shower.
d_counseling_exia_08_6,"What?
Are you offering me the best shower in the Outpost?"
d_counseling_exia_08_7,"It will be my pleasure, I assure you."
d_counseling_exia_08_8,... Noob.
d_counseling_exia_08_9,Are you actually that dumb? Or are you just a crafty pervert?
d_counseling_exia_08_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_09_1,Work has made me feel so stressed out lately.
d_counseling_exia_09_2,"I require a means of escape, of release."
d_counseling_exia_09_3,What's been stressing you out?
d_counseling_exia_09_4,Let's run away together.
d_counseling_exia_09_5,"Since I work in the Information Division, everyone's eyes are on me constantly."
d_counseling_exia_09_6,"Thus, I'll have to tell you using a secret code."
d_counseling_exia_09_7,"*Tap-* *Tap tap* *Tap tap tap-*
*Tap- tap-* *Tap- tap tap tap*"
d_counseling_exia_09_8,"It's Morse code for ""dumb""."
d_counseling_exia_09_9,It is the perfect descriptor for every single one of my co-workers.
d_counseling_exia_09_10,!!
d_counseling_exia_09_11,I know just the place. Online!
d_counseling_exia_09_12,Meet me tonight at 11.
d_counseling_exia_09_13,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_10_1,"Just once before I die,"
d_counseling_exia_10_2,I would like to hack Enikk's mainframe.
d_counseling_exia_10_3,"If you want it that badly, just go for it."
d_counseling_exia_10_4,I can't allow that. It's too dangerous.
d_counseling_exia_10_5,!!
d_counseling_exia_10_6,You have surprised and impressed me!
d_counseling_exia_10_7,"You are willing to get a little dirty, and are not afraid of the consequences."
d_counseling_exia_10_8,"You have officially earned a small part of my respect, Noob."
d_counseling_exia_10_9,I completely understand.
d_counseling_exia_10_10,"If I ever get up to anything, then mum's the word, Noob."
d_counseling_exia_10_11,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_11_1,This feels like an intervention...
d_counseling_exia_11_2,"If anyone needs an intervention, it's you for your sorry gaming skills!"
d_counseling_exia_11_3,"Anyway, is there anything you wanted to ask me?"
d_counseling_exia_11_4,What's the attack pattern for the raid boss in chapter 3?
d_counseling_exia_11_5,How can I deal more damage?
d_counseling_exia_11_6,So you want to try and memorize the enemy attack pattern?
d_counseling_exia_11_7,I admire your resolve!
d_counseling_exia_11_8,"As for that particular boss,"
d_counseling_exia_11_9,You just need to watch the ground.
d_counseling_exia_11_10,I don't think we're going to solve that problem in just a single discussion...
d_counseling_exia_11_11,To put it simply... git gud noob!
d_counseling_exia_11_12,"During our discussion, Exia and I talked about gaming skills."
d_counseling_exia_12_1,It feels like there are more people than usual talking trash and not being able to back it up.
d_counseling_exia_12_2,How should I deal with them?
d_counseling_exia_12_3,Helloooooo? Anyone there?
d_counseling_exia_12_4,Mute their mics
d_counseling_exia_12_5,Request a PVP with them.
d_counseling_exia_12_6,No way! Voice chat is a must during a raid!
d_counseling_exia_12_7,"No matter how infuriating those guys can be,"
d_counseling_exia_12_8,A raid would be impossible if I muted their mics.
d_counseling_exia_12_9,Hmm-
d_counseling_exia_12_10,I guess the only way to solve this problem is to take it to the proverbial streets!
d_counseling_exia_12_11,Time to show them who's boss!
d_counseling_exia_12_12,I spend some meaningful time together with Exia.
d_counseling_exia_13_1,"Whenever Novel wants to activate her sleuthing skills,"
d_counseling_exia_13_2,she tumbles all over the house.
d_counseling_exia_13_3,"She makes such a racket, I can't concentrate on my games!"
d_counseling_exia_13_4,Help her activate her sleuthing skills more quickly.
d_counseling_exia_13_5,Have her go to a gym instead of the house.
d_counseling_exia_13_6,How am I supposed to do that?
d_counseling_exia_13_7,You mean I should be tossing myself to and fro as well?
d_counseling_exia_13_8,What an absurd idea!
d_counseling_exia_13_9,"Hey, nice!"
d_counseling_exia_13_10,Good idea.
d_counseling_exia_13_11,Press F to pay respects!
d_counseling_exia_13_12,Exia and I talk more about Novel's sleuthing skills.
d_counseling_exia_14_1,"When I see Guillotine playing with a concept on social media,"
d_counseling_exia_14_2,it looks so fun.
d_counseling_exia_14_3,So I also want to have a try.
d_counseling_exia_14_4,What kind of concept do you think would suit me?
d_counseling_exia_14_5,A detective otaku who is crazy about mystery.
d_counseling_exia_14_6,A girl with a Super Wyrm.
d_counseling_exia_14_7,Wow!
d_counseling_exia_14_8,I have someone close to me to refer to!
d_counseling_exia_14_9,That sounds interesting.
d_counseling_exia_14_10,What?
d_counseling_exia_14_11,Guillotine has already used this concept...
d_counseling_exia_14_12,No other ideas?
d_counseling_exia_14_13,I have a conversation with Exia about SNS.
d_counseling_exia_15_1,Arrrrghhhh!
d_counseling_exia_15_2,There's a bug in the game that prevented me from clearing this mission.
d_counseling_exia_15_3,Try and debug the game yourself.
d_counseling_exia_15_4,Just play another game for the time being.
d_counseling_exia_15_5,"Hey, good idea!"
d_counseling_exia_15_6,I'll hack into the game and get rid of the bug.
d_counseling_exia_15_7,The game developers ought to thank me!
d_counseling_exia_15_8,"But once I beat this boss, I'll have finished the game!"
d_counseling_exia_15_9,"I can't back down now, not with the final boss standing right in front of me!"
d_counseling_exia_15_10,I won't stand for it!
d_counseling_exia_15_11,Exia and I have a conversation about video game bugs.
d_counseling_exia_16_1,What should I do if I'm not gelling with my team
d_counseling_exia_16_2,during a team PVP match?
d_counseling_exia_16_3,Turn on voice chat.
d_counseling_exia_16_4,Carry the team on your back.
d_counseling_exia_16_5,Oh boy...
d_counseling_exia_16_6,voice chatting with strangers on the internet?
d_counseling_exia_16_7,No thank you.
d_counseling_exia_16_8,"Well, considering that I am a top-ranked player,"
d_counseling_exia_16_9,that might be the easiest way around all of this.
d_counseling_exia_16_10,Exia and I talk more about PVP games.
d_counseling_exia_17_1,Noob.
d_counseling_exia_17_2,"If the world were going to end tomorrow, what would you do?"
d_counseling_exia_17_3,I would plant an apple tree.
d_counseling_exia_17_4,I would complete more side missions in this game I'm playing.
d_counseling_exia_17_5,"In case you forgot, allow me to remind you..."
d_counseling_exia_17_6,It's illegal to plant seeds within the civilian sector.
d_counseling_exia_17_7,Holy moly!
d_counseling_exia_17_8,I didn't realize you were such an avid gamer!
d_counseling_exia_17_9,I have a conversation with Exia about the end of the world.
d_counseling_exia_18_1,"My strength stats aren't up to snuff, so I'm getting my butt handed to me in this game."
d_counseling_exia_18_2,What do you think I should do?
d_counseling_exia_18_3,I'd consider being more strategic.
d_counseling_exia_18_4,I'd rage-quit.
d_counseling_exia_18_5,Right... mental fortitude could potentially make up for a lack of physical strength.
d_counseling_exia_18_6,"It may not be ideal, but it's all I've got."
d_counseling_exia_18_7,"If you do that, then your tenacity might as well be zero as well!"
d_counseling_exia_18_8,I didn't know you were such a filthy casual!
d_counseling_exia_18_9,Exia and I got into a heated discussion about tough games.
d_counseling_exia_19_1,...
d_counseling_exia_19_2,Exia is focused on playing a game.
d_counseling_exia_19_3,It's time for our appointment.
d_counseling_exia_19_4,Turn on the same game.
d_counseling_exia_19_5,"Take a hint, will you? Can't you see I'm in the middle of a guild war?"
d_counseling_exia_19_6,"Moreover, you're in the same guild as me!"
d_counseling_exia_19_7,You're using our discussion time as an excuse to slack off! Why I oughta...
d_counseling_exia_19_8,"Perfect, you joined just in time!"
d_counseling_exia_19_9,We were short a member.
d_counseling_exia_19_10,"We're at war with the North Wind Guild. Teleport over here, and then..."
d_counseling_exia_19_11,Exia and I used the remaining time allotted for our discussion to go all out in a guild war.
d_counseling_exia_20_1,"As the top hacker in the Ark, I've been digging up all sorts of secrets."
d_counseling_exia_20_2,"But when I searched your name, I didn't come up with anything."
d_counseling_exia_20_3,Just who exactly are you?
d_counseling_exia_20_4,"I'm a new species, neither human nor machine."
d_counseling_exia_20_5,I don't remember. You have to help me remember my identity.
d_counseling_exia_20_6,You are so guilty...
d_counseling_exia_20_7,of being boring.
d_counseling_exia_20_8,"Amnesia, how corny can you get..."
d_counseling_exia_20_9,"However,"
d_counseling_exia_20_10,"I have to maintain my reputation as a master hacker, so I'll give it another whirl."
d_counseling_exia_20_11,I have a conversation with Exia about hacking personal information.
d_counseling_folkwang_01_1,Ugh... It's so hot!
d_counseling_folkwang_01_2,Aaah! I'm practically melting!
d_counseling_folkwang_01_3,"Coach, how can I keep myself from getting too hot?"
d_counseling_folkwang_01_4,Put an ice cube in your mouth.
d_counseling_folkwang_01_5,Would hugging me help?
d_counseling_folkwang_01_6,"Mmm, that does sound like a good idea..."
d_counseling_folkwang_01_7,"But, no thanks."
d_counseling_folkwang_01_8,"If I did that, I wouldn't be able to talk with you, Coach!."
d_counseling_folkwang_01_9,Really? Are you sure?
d_counseling_folkwang_01_10,"Your body is always so cool, Coach. It feels so good!"
d_counseling_folkwang_01_11,Thank you so much!
d_counseling_folkwang_01_12,I research ways to make the heat bearable with Folkwang.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_1,I was talking to Rumani...
d_counseling_folkwang_02_2,that I started taking ice supplements to change my constitution but she got really mad.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_3,Do you have any idea why?
d_counseling_folkwang_02_4,Because you chose supplements instead of exercise.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_5,She just doesn't like ice supplements.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_6,No way! Do you really think that's the reason?
d_counseling_folkwang_02_7,I know Rumani likes exercising but not to that extent...
d_counseling_folkwang_02_8,Nah. I don't think that's it.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_9,Oh? I think you're right.
d_counseling_folkwang_02_10,I gave her some after working out...
d_counseling_folkwang_02_11,and she said she wouldn't eat them! Plus she must have been really hot!
d_counseling_folkwang_02_12,"Now that my head's a little cooler, I've figured it out!"
d_counseling_folkwang_02_13,I talk more with Folkwang about Rumani.
d_counseling_folkwang_03_1,"Hey, Coach."
d_counseling_folkwang_03_2,Why do people sweat?
d_counseling_folkwang_03_3,I don't think it makes our lives better at all.
d_counseling_folkwang_03_4,Sweating helps adjust your body temperature.
d_counseling_folkwang_03_5,Your body sweats just to give you a hard time.
d_counseling_folkwang_03_6,Help adjust your body temperature?
d_counseling_folkwang_03_7,Then why doesn't it ever work?
d_counseling_folkwang_03_8,My body is always so hot!
d_counseling_folkwang_03_9,It doesn't make any sense!
d_counseling_folkwang_03_10,Right? I knew it was just to give me a hard time!
d_counseling_folkwang_03_11,Ugh! Sweat... I'll never forgive you...
d_counseling_folkwang_03_12,I have a sweaty conversation with Folkwang.
d_counseling_folkwang_04_1,"I have a question for you, Coach."
d_counseling_folkwang_04_2,"if there are one that can't stand the cold and one who can't stand the heat,"
d_counseling_folkwang_04_3,would you turn the air conditioner on or off?
d_counseling_folkwang_04_4,I think turning it on would be right.
d_counseling_folkwang_04_5,I think turning it off would be for the best.
d_counseling_folkwang_04_6,Right! You've gotta turn it on!
d_counseling_folkwang_04_7,"If they get cold, they should just wear a jacket."
d_counseling_folkwang_04_8,But someone who feels hot can't just take all their clothes off!
d_counseling_folkwang_04_9,"Uh... Epinel, we will see about this!"
d_counseling_folkwang_04_10,Is that really the right choice?
d_counseling_folkwang_04_11,"Then, I might just die..."
d_counseling_folkwang_04_12,I'll melt into a little puddle...
d_counseling_folkwang_04_13,"I turn the air conditioning up for Folkwang, who was feeling a bit hot."
d_counseling_folkwang_05_1,"Coach, what kind of weather do you like the most?"
d_counseling_folkwang_05_2,Sunny days.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_3,Cloudy days.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_4,I don't like sunny days.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_5,They're always too hot for me.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_6,"Me, too! Cloudy days are the best."
d_counseling_folkwang_05_7,I used to love rainy days more...
d_counseling_folkwang_05_8,The rain always felt like it was washing away my sweat.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_9,"But, there aren't many rainy days in the Ark, and getting wet in the rain makes me feel uncomfortable."
d_counseling_folkwang_05_10,That's why I prefer cloudy days now.
d_counseling_folkwang_05_11,I have a conversation with Folkwang about the weather.
d_counseling_folkwang_06_1,"Coach, you haven't used your vacation days yet, but when you do..."
d_counseling_folkwang_06_2,where will you go?
d_counseling_folkwang_06_3,The Commander's Room.
d_counseling_folkwang_06_4,The swimming pool.
d_counseling_folkwang_06_5,"Of course, the Commander's Room is cool. And it's nice if Coach is there..."
d_counseling_folkwang_06_6,But wouldn't it be a little boring to go there for vacation?
d_counseling_folkwang_06_7,Really? You really want to go to the swimming pool?
d_counseling_folkwang_06_8,"Then, take me with you!"
d_counseling_folkwang_06_9,I love taking a dip!
d_counseling_folkwang_06_10,I have a conversation with Folkwang about vacations.
d_counseling_folkwang_07_1,Do you think everyone in the world
d_counseling_folkwang_07_2,hates sweaty people?
d_counseling_folkwang_07_3,"If they do, it'd really hurt my feelings."
d_counseling_folkwang_07_4,... Good luck with that.
d_counseling_folkwang_07_5,"No, of course not. They don't hate sweaty people..."
d_counseling_folkwang_07_6,...
d_counseling_folkwang_07_7,"Coach, you make me feel even worse."
d_counseling_folkwang_07_8,"*Sniff* Thanks, Coach."
d_counseling_folkwang_07_9,Coach always takes better care of me than anyone else!
d_counseling_folkwang_07_10,I listen to Folkwang about the sufferings of sweaty people.
d_counseling_folkwang_08_1,"Recently, I get the feeling that Epinel thinks that I'm a little pathetic."
d_counseling_folkwang_08_2,"Whenever our eyes meet, she always keeps shaking her head!"
d_counseling_folkwang_08_3,"But, I'm even older than she is!"
d_counseling_folkwang_08_4,Are you sure you're older?
d_counseling_folkwang_08_5,"Then try to be more understanding of her, since you are older."
d_counseling_folkwang_08_6,!!
d_counseling_folkwang_08_7,Uh... Maybe I'm not.
d_counseling_folkwang_08_8,"After all, Nikkes never look like their true age..."
d_counseling_folkwang_08_9,...
d_counseling_folkwang_08_10,"From now, I'll be careful with how I treat Epinel."
d_counseling_folkwang_08_11,"That's exactly the kind of answer I expected from you, Coach."
d_counseling_folkwang_08_12,"Even though I might not be older,"
d_counseling_folkwang_08_13,I will still try to understand her because I physically look older!
d_counseling_folkwang_08_14,I have a conversation with Folkwang about Epinel.
d_counseling_folkwang_09_1,Sugar keeps saying that biking is the best way to keep your cool while moving.
d_counseling_folkwang_09_2,"But, no matter how I think about it, I think running is better."
d_counseling_folkwang_09_3,"What do you think, Coach?"
d_counseling_folkwang_09_4,Running is the best.
d_counseling_folkwang_09_5,Cycling is better.
d_counseling_folkwang_09_6,Exactly!
d_counseling_folkwang_09_7,"When you run forward, the cool wind hits your face!"
d_counseling_folkwang_09_8,"The air feels really good on my legs, too!"
d_counseling_folkwang_09_9,You know me best of all!
d_counseling_folkwang_09_10,"You really think so, Coach?"
d_counseling_folkwang_09_11,I can't believe it. I thought you'd understand me..
d_counseling_folkwang_09_12,I feel a little sad now...
d_counseling_folkwang_09_13,I have a conversation with Folkwang about how amazing running is.
d_counseling_folkwang_10_1,"Coach, what type of ice Splendamin do you like most?"
d_counseling_folkwang_10_2,Soda ice Splendamin is my favorite!
d_counseling_folkwang_10_3,I don't really like ice Splendamin...
d_counseling_folkwang_10_4,Want me to get you some?
d_counseling_folkwang_10_5,What? Why not?!
d_counseling_folkwang_10_6,It's so delicious. What's not to like?!
d_counseling_folkwang_10_7,"You know nothing about cold food, Coach!"
d_counseling_folkwang_10_8,"You mean, now?"
d_counseling_folkwang_10_9,"I always feel so touched by your kindness, Coach!"
d_counseling_folkwang_10_10,I have a good time with Folkwang.
d_counseling_folkwang_11_1,"When you've been running for a long time, sometimes you'll suddenly get a second wind."
d_counseling_folkwang_11_2,"There's a word to describe this, what was it called again?"
d_counseling_folkwang_11_3,Runner's high.
d_counseling_folkwang_11_4,Driver's high.
d_counseling_folkwang_11_5,"Ah, that's right!"
d_counseling_folkwang_11_6,Have you ever experienced that?
d_counseling_folkwang_11_7,"If you haven't, do you want to go running?"
d_counseling_folkwang_11_8,Hmm... Isn't that a name of a song?
d_counseling_folkwang_11_9,I think it was the opening theme to a teen drama... was it GTX?
d_counseling_folkwang_11_10,Folkwang instilled the joy of running in me.
d_counseling_folkwang_12_1,"All right, I've made up my mind."
d_counseling_folkwang_12_2,I'm going to quit being an athlete and become a doctor.
d_counseling_folkwang_12_3,Have you grown bored with playing sports?
d_counseling_folkwang_12_4,Is that just because you'll have plenty of nurses around to wipe off your sweat?
d_counseling_folkwang_12_5,What? Absolutely not!
d_counseling_folkwang_12_6,"It's just... I sweat so darn much, that I was wondering what I could do about it."
d_counseling_folkwang_12_7,"I was just thinking out loud, don't pay me any mind."
d_counseling_folkwang_12_8,H-how did you know?!
d_counseling_folkwang_12_9,I can't believe you guessed that!
d_counseling_folkwang_12_10,Folkwang and I started to look into what you had to study to become a doctor.
d_counseling_folkwang_12_11,... and abandoned the plan 30 minutes later.
d_counseling_folkwang_13_1,"When you run in the morning, you get to meet a lot of people."
d_counseling_folkwang_13_2,I ran into this little girl who is simply adorable. I could just pinch her cheeks.
d_counseling_folkwang_13_3,Do you think it'd be all right if I said hi to her?
d_counseling_folkwang_13_4,"Sure, go for it."
d_counseling_folkwang_13_5,You might freak her out.
d_counseling_folkwang_13_6,You're right. I just need to put my apprehension aside and go for it.
d_counseling_folkwang_13_7,I'll go up to her tomorrow!
d_counseling_folkwang_13_8,"Well, in that case..."
d_counseling_folkwang_13_9,I guess I'll wait a bit more before approaching her.
d_counseling_folkwang_13_10,Folkwang and I went over ways to greet people in a friendly manner.
d_counseling_folkwang_14_1,"I was looking at the recommended dosage for this supplement I have,"
d_counseling_folkwang_14_2,when a thought suddenly occurred to me.
d_counseling_folkwang_14_3,"If you took more than the recommended amount, wouldn't they be even more effective?"
d_counseling_folkwang_14_4,They don't call it the recommended dosage for anything.
d_counseling_folkwang_14_5,I think you may be onto something.
d_counseling_folkwang_14_6,"But two is better than one, and three is better than two."
d_counseling_folkwang_14_7,What's wrong with that logic?
d_counseling_folkwang_14_8,I'll test it out later.
d_counseling_folkwang_14_9,I think so too!
d_counseling_folkwang_14_10,I'm gonna go down my entire stash of supplements!
d_counseling_folkwang_14_11,Straight down the hatch!
d_counseling_folkwang_14_12,"That evening, Folkwang suffered from stomach pains."
d_counseling_folkwang_15_1,I finally found a way to deal with my sweating problem!
d_counseling_folkwang_15_2,All I've got to do...
d_counseling_folkwang_15_3,is slap maxi pads all over my body!
d_counseling_folkwang_15_4,Won't that weigh you down?
d_counseling_folkwang_15_5,That is a genius idea!
d_counseling_folkwang_15_6,"Hmm, that's a good point."
d_counseling_folkwang_15_7,"Sure, I won't be wet with sweat, but I'll be so weighed down that I won't be able to run properly."
d_counseling_folkwang_15_8,Are there any pads that get your sweat to evaporate?
d_counseling_folkwang_15_9,Exactly! It's foolproof!
d_counseling_folkwang_15_10,I'll go try it right now...
d_counseling_folkwang_15_11,"On second thought, that won't work. It'd only end up weighing me down."
d_counseling_folkwang_15_12,Folkwang and I try to come up with other methods to alleviate her perspiration issue.
d_counseling_folkwang_16_1,"Whenever I see myself sweating, I can't help but feel"
d_counseling_folkwang_16_2,it might make the people around me feel uncomfortable...
d_counseling_folkwang_16_3,You shouldn't worry about what other people think.
d_counseling_folkwang_16_4,"It's okay, because your sweat actually smells quite nice."
d_counseling_folkwang_16_5,I shouldn't?
d_counseling_folkwang_16_6,"Since I'm an athlete, I always thought it was normal to care about what other people think."
d_counseling_folkwang_16_7,"But, if you say I shouldn't, then I won't!"
d_counseling_folkwang_16_8,Wh-what did you say?
d_counseling_folkwang_16_9,When did you have a chance to smell me before?
d_counseling_folkwang_16_10,"Wait, are you doing it right now?!"
d_counseling_folkwang_16_11,S-stop! Plug up your nose!
d_counseling_folkwang_16_12,Folkwang and I share our opinions on the matter.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_1,Being in battle can be a terrifying thing.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_2,"Even though combat is second nature to a Nikke, I can't help but feel a little scared."
d_counseling_folkwang_17_3,Do you know any methods to deal with this?
d_counseling_folkwang_17_4,Let's try finding a supplement that makes you enjoy combat.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_5,Have faith in your squadmates.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_6,I can't believe I didn't think of that!
d_counseling_folkwang_17_7,"I'm not sure if that's something supplements can help with, but"
d_counseling_folkwang_17_8,I'll see what I can find.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_9,But... I'm the only one who gets scared.
d_counseling_folkwang_17_10,What does trusting my squadmates have to do with this?
d_counseling_folkwang_17_11,Folkwang and I look into different methods to help her overcome her fear.
d_counseling_folkwang_18_1,Epinel once asked me
d_counseling_folkwang_18_2,why I prefer running when it's so much faster to ride a board.
d_counseling_folkwang_18_3,It got me thinking... why exactly do I prefer it?
d_counseling_folkwang_18_4,"With running, you can gain momentum without any outside assistance."
d_counseling_folkwang_18_5,Because you feel alive when you run.
d_counseling_folkwang_18_6,You're right.
d_counseling_folkwang_18_7,"When I run, I have to depend on nothing but my own strength to make me gain speed."
d_counseling_folkwang_18_8,Kicking off from the ground and running with my back to the wind... I can't get enough of it!
d_counseling_folkwang_18_9,"So... if I stop running, I'd die?"
d_counseling_folkwang_18_10,That can't be right...
d_counseling_folkwang_18_11,Folkwang and I talk about how much running means to her.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_1,"Come to think of it, I've never seen you take any supplements."
d_counseling_folkwang_19_2,You should take some with me.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_3,I'll recommend you a good one.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_4,"I'm already quite healthy, so it's okay."
d_counseling_folkwang_19_5,I'm already taking some.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_6,You don't take supplements for immediate health benefits.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_7,It's a long-term investment.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_8,So you should really start taking them now.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_9,Really? What do you take?
d_counseling_folkwang_19_10,Can you show me what you're taking?
d_counseling_folkwang_19_11,I can have a look at its nutritional components.
d_counseling_folkwang_19_12,Folkwang and I have a back and forth about supplements.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_1,Ugh... I trained with Rumani and my entire body feels so sore now.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_2,She really put me through the wringer.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_3,"Call it what you will, but I call it abuse."
d_counseling_folkwang_20_4,She's just doing her best to help you.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_5,"You're right, let's go talk to her."
d_counseling_folkwang_20_6,"Hmm... well, when you put it like that..."
d_counseling_folkwang_20_7,She's probably just doing what she feels is best for me.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_8,... But that doesn't change the fact that I'm in pain.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_9,Yes! Let's give her a piece of our minds!
d_counseling_folkwang_20_10,"Actually, now that I think about it, I've never adjusted my pace when I go jogging with her."
d_counseling_folkwang_20_11,I think we're both just trying to lift each other up.
d_counseling_folkwang_20_12,Folkwang and I talk more about members of Nepenthe.
d_counseling_frima_01_1,*Sigh*
d_counseling_frima_01_2,Tired now. Sleep.
d_counseling_frima_01_3,You're tired because you sleep too much.
d_counseling_frima_01_4,"If you're tired, then you should sleep."
d_counseling_frima_01_5,Yes.
d_counseling_frima_01_6,Slept too much. Tired.
d_counseling_frima_01_7,Tired. Going to sleep.
d_counseling_frima_01_8,Slept too much. Tired.
d_counseling_frima_01_9,Tired. Going to sleep.
d_counseling_frima_01_10,I watch Frima as she drifts off to sleep.
d_counseling_frima_02_1,Food.
d_counseling_frima_02_2,Which?
d_counseling_frima_02_3,Steak.
d_counseling_frima_02_4,Sandwich.
d_counseling_frima_02_5,Steak.
d_counseling_frima_02_6,Hard to eat.
d_counseling_frima_02_7,No like.
d_counseling_frima_02_8,Sandwich.
d_counseling_frima_02_9,Simple.
d_counseling_frima_02_10,I like.
d_counseling_frima_02_11,I have a very quiet dinner with Frima.
d_counseling_frima_03_1,Coffee. Cream.
d_counseling_frima_03_2,More?
d_counseling_frima_03_3,Keep it coming until there's more cream than coffee.
d_counseling_frima_03_4,Just enough so I can taste it.
d_counseling_frima_03_5,...
d_counseling_frima_03_6,Satisfied.
d_counseling_frima_03_7,Pleased.
d_counseling_frima_03_8,...
d_counseling_frima_03_9,That won't...
d_counseling_frima_03_10,Not good.
d_counseling_frima_03_11,I spend an extremely relaxed tea time with Frima.
d_counseling_frima_04_1,Today. Orders. Outside.
d_counseling_frima_04_2,Annoying.
d_counseling_frima_04_3,Instead?
d_counseling_frima_04_4,What are you scheduled to do? I'll do it for you.
d_counseling_frima_04_5,You need to do your own work.
d_counseling_frima_04_6,...
d_counseling_frima_04_7,Explain is boring.
d_counseling_frima_04_8,Will do.
d_counseling_frima_04_9,...
d_counseling_frima_04_10,True.
d_counseling_frima_04_11,Going now.
d_counseling_frima_04_12,I help Frima prepare.
d_counseling_frima_05_1,Sleep. Place.
d_counseling_frima_05_2,Want... nice place.
d_counseling_frima_05_3,Just sleep here.
d_counseling_frima_05_4,Hospital beds are nice.
d_counseling_frima_05_5,Yes.
d_counseling_frima_05_6,Sleep.
d_counseling_frima_05_7,Hold hand.
d_counseling_frima_05_8,Like bed.
d_counseling_frima_05_9,...
d_counseling_frima_05_10,"Mary. Scary.
Won't go."
d_counseling_frima_05_11,I watch Frima sleep.
d_counseling_frima_06_1,Sugar. Milk. Noisy.
d_counseling_frima_06_2,Can't sleep.
d_counseling_frima_06_3,Annoyed.
d_counseling_frima_06_4,I'll talk to them.
d_counseling_frima_06_5,But you'd be bored without them.
d_counseling_frima_06_6,No.
d_counseling_frima_06_7,My problem. I solve.
d_counseling_frima_06_8,True.
d_counseling_frima_06_9,Can handle noise.
d_counseling_frima_06_10,... But still annoyed.
d_counseling_frima_06_11,I talk with Frima about the members of Cafe Sweety.
d_counseling_frima_07_1,Orders came.
d_counseling_frima_07_2,Hard.
d_counseling_frima_07_3,Bothersome.
d_counseling_frima_07_4,"But you'll do it because you enjoy it, right?"
d_counseling_frima_07_5,Then take the day off.
d_counseling_frima_07_6,Right.
d_counseling_frima_07_7,Worth it.
d_counseling_frima_07_8,No.
d_counseling_frima_07_9,Trouble for client.
d_counseling_frima_07_10,I plan out the assignment with Frima.
d_counseling_frima_08_1,Sleep. Now.
d_counseling_frima_08_2,Music. Recommend?
d_counseling_frima_08_3,Classical music with a slow tempo.
d_counseling_frima_08_4,No music. Noise canceling headphones instead.
d_counseling_frima_08_5,Classical.
d_counseling_frima_08_6,Too loud.
d_counseling_frima_08_7,Can't sleep.
d_counseling_frima_08_8,!!
d_counseling_frima_08_9,Idea. New.
d_counseling_frima_08_10,Satisfied.
d_counseling_frima_08_11,Frima and I drift off to a world of tranquility.
d_counseling_frima_09_1,My sleep habits.
d_counseling_frima_09_2,"Good?
Bad?"
d_counseling_frima_09_3,I'm not sure. I think you look kinda cute when you're asleep.
d_counseling_frima_09_4,They're fine. You sleep quietly enough.
d_counseling_frima_09_5,...
d_counseling_frima_09_6,Awkward.
d_counseling_frima_09_7,Sleep.
d_counseling_frima_09_8,... Nice.
d_counseling_frima_09_9,...?
d_counseling_frima_09_10,You watch?
d_counseling_frima_09_11,Strange feeling.
d_counseling_frima_09_12,I talk with Frima about sleeping habits.
d_counseling_frima_10_1,Strange dream.
d_counseling_frima_10_2,World. Bed. Sofa. All gone.
d_counseling_frima_10_3,Nightmare. Terrible.
d_counseling_frima_10_4,Indeed. Sleeping on the floor is uncomfortable.
d_counseling_frima_10_5,"But you could sleep on literally anything, right?"
d_counseling_frima_10_6,Right.
d_counseling_frima_10_7,So. Nightmare.
d_counseling_frima_10_8,...
d_counseling_frima_10_9,Right.
d_counseling_frima_10_10,Any place good. Can sleep.
d_counseling_frima_10_11,Just. Random dream.
d_counseling_frima_10_12,I talk with Frima about nightmares.
d_counseling_frima_11_1,This week.
d_counseling_frima_11_2,Milk Coffee. Better sales.
d_counseling_frima_11_3,Don't understand.
d_counseling_frima_11_4,I'm sure Cream Coffee will sell better next week.
d_counseling_frima_11_5,Let's forget about Cream Coffee and develop a new recipe.
d_counseling_frima_11_6,...!!
d_counseling_frima_11_7,You will buy?
d_counseling_frima_11_8,"No, I won't."
d_counseling_frima_11_9,Cream Coffee. My thing.
d_counseling_frima_11_10,Frima and I talk about ways to increase Cream Coffee sales.
d_counseling_frima_12_1,Extra credits.
d_counseling_frima_12_2,How to use?
d_counseling_frima_12_3,They'll go towards reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_frima_12_4,They'll go towards renovating some facilities in the Outpost.
d_counseling_frima_12_5,Honorable.
d_counseling_frima_12_6,No fun.
d_counseling_frima_12_7,!!
d_counseling_frima_12_8,Better bed?
d_counseling_frima_12_9,Pillow. Blankets too?
d_counseling_frima_12_10,Frima and I dream of ways to spend all our newly earned credits.
d_counseling_frima_13_1,Can't sleep.
d_counseling_frima_13_2,What now?
d_counseling_frima_13_3,Try looking at your phone.
d_counseling_frima_13_4,Try counting sheep.
d_counseling_frima_13_5,Dangerous.
d_counseling_frima_13_6,Drop phone. Hurt nose.
d_counseling_frima_13_7,What?
d_counseling_frima_13_8,Effective?
d_counseling_frima_13_9,One sheep. Two sh...
d_counseling_frima_13_10,Zzz.
d_counseling_frima_13_11,Frima and I talk about ways to help with sleep.
d_counseling_frima_14_1,Customer today.
d_counseling_frima_14_2,Difficult. Annoying.
d_counseling_frima_14_3,What did they want?
d_counseling_frima_14_4,Let them have it next time.
d_counseling_frima_14_5,Refused vending machine.
d_counseling_frima_14_6,Requested coffee machine.
d_counseling_frima_14_7,Kicked them out.
d_counseling_frima_14_8,I will.
d_counseling_frima_14_9,Shoot blank. Show him.
d_counseling_frima_14_10,Frima and I have a conversation on how to deal with difficult customers.
d_counseling_frima_15_1,Account. Confirmed.
d_counseling_frima_15_2,Amount. Not enough.
d_counseling_frima_15_3,Why?
d_counseling_frima_15_4,It's because you've been putting off going to work.
d_counseling_frima_15_5,It's because of the economic recession.
d_counseling_frima_15_6,...
d_counseling_frima_15_7,Maybe.
d_counseling_frima_15_8,What is that?
d_counseling_frima_15_9,So... not my fault?
d_counseling_frima_15_10,Feel better.
d_counseling_frima_15_11,Frima talks to me about her financial situation.
d_counseling_frima_16_1,Boss. Scary.
d_counseling_frima_16_2,The clothes?
d_counseling_frima_16_3,Bothersome?
d_counseling_frima_16_4,?
d_counseling_frima_16_5,That. Boss. Hobby.
d_counseling_frima_16_6,My preference. NO.
d_counseling_frima_16_7,But. Not scary.
d_counseling_frima_16_8,!
d_counseling_frima_16_9,Bingo.
d_counseling_frima_16_10,Boss. Noisy. Bothersome?
d_counseling_frima_16_11,Sleep can't. Scary.
d_counseling_frima_16_12,Felt uncomfortable with Frima thinking of Mustang.
d_counseling_frima_17_1,Get rich.
d_counseling_frima_17_2,How?
d_counseling_frima_17_3,Sleep more and cut back on your spending.
d_counseling_frima_17_4,Work more and make an extra coin.
d_counseling_frima_17_5,!!
d_counseling_frima_17_6,Yes! Smart!
d_counseling_frima_17_7,Genius!
d_counseling_frima_17_8,Too hard.
d_counseling_frima_17_9,Impossible.
d_counseling_frima_17_10,"While studying the ways to become rich, Frima and I gradually drift off to sleep together."
d_counseling_frima_18_1,...
d_counseling_frima_18_2,...
d_counseling_frima_18_3,Are you not feeling well?
d_counseling_frima_18_4,Do you not want to talk since you don't feel well?
d_counseling_frima_18_5,Frima shakes her head left and right.
d_counseling_frima_18_6,Tired.
d_counseling_frima_18_7,!
d_counseling_frima_18_8,Frima nods her head.
d_counseling_frima_18_9,Sleep? Yes? No?
d_counseling_frima_18_10,I nodded.
d_counseling_frima_18_11,Thanks.
d_counseling_frima_18_12,Frima fell asleep.
d_counseling_frima_19_1,Raining. Can do what?
d_counseling_frima_19_2,Head back to bed.
d_counseling_frima_19_3,Go to drink a Cream Coffee.
d_counseling_frima_19_4,Yes.
d_counseling_frima_19_5,"Raining, so fall asleep."
d_counseling_frima_19_6,Zzz.
d_counseling_frima_19_7,!
d_counseling_frima_19_8,Good.
d_counseling_frima_19_9,But too sleepy.
d_counseling_frima_19_10,Sleep.
d_counseling_frima_19_11,I fell asleep with Frima while listening to the rain.
d_counseling_frima_20_1,Sofa. Soft. Hard.
d_counseling_frima_20_2,Which?
d_counseling_frima_20_3,Why does it matter?
d_counseling_frima_20_4,A nice and soft sofa is the only way to go.
d_counseling_frima_20_5,Important.
d_counseling_frima_20_6,"Sofa good, more sleep."
d_counseling_frima_20_7,Wow.
d_counseling_frima_20_8,You smart.
d_counseling_frima_20_9,Soft good.
d_counseling_frima_20_10,Frima and I browsed the new sofa catalog.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_1,The wind is awfully loud today.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_2,Don't you think so?
d_counseling_guillotine_01_3,??
d_counseling_guillotine_01_4,It's almost as if... the wind is weeping.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_5,...
d_counseling_guillotine_01_6,I should have known.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_7,I suppose ignorance is bliss for commoners.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_8,Truly.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_9,This wind may have carried something harmful into the Ark.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_10,"Let's hurry, before the wind stops."
d_counseling_guillotine_01_11,It is agreed.
d_counseling_guillotine_01_12,I spend some meaningful time together with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_02_1,*Ha. Ha*
d_counseling_guillotine_02_2,*Tee hee hee*
d_counseling_guillotine_02_3,Ignore her.
d_counseling_guillotine_02_4,Why are you laughing?
d_counseling_guillotine_02_5,*Glance*
d_counseling_guillotine_02_6,*Keep glancing*
d_counseling_guillotine_02_7,Act like you didn't see anything.
d_counseling_guillotine_02_8,...
d_counseling_guillotine_02_9,Ha! A foolish question!
d_counseling_guillotine_02_10,Today is the day the blood moon rises upon the abyss.
d_counseling_guillotine_02_11,That means the demon inside me will rise up as well.
d_counseling_guillotine_02_12,"So this laughter is not mine. It is that of the Devil inside, which has been temporarily set free!"
d_counseling_guillotine_02_13,"I beg of you, Partner. Do not come near me during this time."
d_counseling_guillotine_02_14,"If you get too close to me, I... could be dangerous to you."
d_counseling_guillotine_02_15,"Guillotine leaves the room, her clothing flapping in an invisible breeze."
d_counseling_guillotine_03_1,"Partner, sometimes I..."
d_counseling_guillotine_03_2,I cannot bear the burden of blood lain upon me.
d_counseling_guillotine_03_3,How... do you control this feeling?
d_counseling_guillotine_03_4,Embrace it. It is what we must do.
d_counseling_guillotine_03_5,Get some exercise. You'll feel better.
d_counseling_guillotine_03_6,I...
d_counseling_guillotine_03_7,Is there really no other way?
d_counseling_guillotine_03_8,...
d_counseling_guillotine_03_9,I don't like it. Too much work.
d_counseling_guillotine_03_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_1,I have to keep a low profile.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_2,The Big O has been extremely active the past few days.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_3,They may very well be eavesdropping on this very conversation.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_4,This place is safe. We're protected by the Aegis Barriers.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_5,The Central Government has better things to do than spy on us.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_6,What...!?
d_counseling_guillotine_04_7,"... Ahem. Well, then.
This location is far more reliable."
d_counseling_guillotine_04_8,I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_9,You'll end up with a knife in your back if you remain that complacent.
d_counseling_guillotine_04_10,I spend some meaningful time together with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_05_1,"Recently, my SNS followers have been increasing."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_2,"They're all interested in the One-Winged Dark Lord sealed inside my right eye, like moths to the flame."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_3,"But if this continues, The Big O is bound to notice my account."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_4,"I need your advice, Partner."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_5,Should I block followers who have private accounts?
d_counseling_guillotine_05_6,Just delete the account.
d_counseling_guillotine_05_7,"No. If you do that, none of our allies with hidden identities can contact you."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_8,You can't be serious!
d_counseling_guillotine_05_9,I wouldn't dream of doing that. Never.
d_counseling_guillotine_05_10,!!
d_counseling_guillotine_05_11,You have a point.
d_counseling_guillotine_05_12,"I was not thinking straight.
Thank you for your help."
d_counseling_guillotine_05_13,I talk with Guillotine about how to handle SNS followers.
d_counseling_guillotine_06_1,Urgh...
d_counseling_guillotine_06_2,My right eye is tingling.
d_counseling_guillotine_06_3,Could it be that the One-Winged Dark Lord's seal has been weakened?
d_counseling_guillotine_06_4,Maybe it's just going to rain.
d_counseling_guillotine_06_5,It could well be.
d_counseling_guillotine_06_6,It's as if I'm being infected by its madness...
d_counseling_guillotine_06_7,...
d_counseling_guillotine_06_8,This is an Outpost. The weather isn't real. Even the rain is artificial.
d_counseling_guillotine_06_9,Do you really think I'd have a pain in my eye just because of that?
d_counseling_guillotine_06_10,I talk with Guillotine about her health.
d_counseling_guillotine_07_1,"Partner, sometimes I wonder..."
d_counseling_guillotine_07_2,Can you even begin to comprehend my loneliness?
d_counseling_guillotine_07_3,"Yes, I do. I'm the only one who does."
d_counseling_guillotine_07_4,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_guillotine_07_5,Yes. This is my destiny.
d_counseling_guillotine_07_6,A Nikke assigned to dispose of other Nikkes.
d_counseling_guillotine_07_7,"What a terrible, lonely fate."
d_counseling_guillotine_07_8,"It may not amount to much, but nevertheless, I'm glad that you understand my situation."
d_counseling_guillotine_07_9,...
d_counseling_guillotine_07_10,"I knew it.
No one can possibly understand what I'm going through."
d_counseling_guillotine_07_11,What a terrible hand I've been dealt in this life.
d_counseling_guillotine_07_12,I spend some lonely time with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_1,It feels like Maiden is keeping her distance from me.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_2,Why?
d_counseling_guillotine_08_3,Could... she be afraid of the kotodama in my words?
d_counseling_guillotine_08_4,She's just shy.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_5,She is not ready to accept your presence.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_6,Tsk.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_7,I thought she'd have gotten used to it by now.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_8,... Hm.
d_counseling_guillotine_08_9,"If that's the case, I can understand."
d_counseling_guillotine_08_10,"After all, I can be a bit of a handful sometimes. Hee hee."
d_counseling_guillotine_08_11,I spend some meaningful time with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_1,Exia.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_2,Exia has been spying on my account recently.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_3,I remember her being part of the Information Center at The Big O.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_4,What's she up to?
d_counseling_guillotine_09_5,"She just thinks your posts are fun to read, that's all."
d_counseling_guillotine_09_6,She's trying to sell you out to The Big O.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_7,...
d_counseling_guillotine_09_8,You really believe that?
d_counseling_guillotine_09_9,Hmph. You're slipping. You've let your guard down.
d_counseling_guillotine_09_10,"You think so, too?"
d_counseling_guillotine_09_11,"In that case, I should block her at once."
d_counseling_guillotine_09_12,I spend some meaningful time with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_10_1,Partner...
d_counseling_guillotine_10_2,What would it be like to have a soulmate?
d_counseling_guillotine_10_3,Someone who stays with you for the rest of your life?
d_counseling_guillotine_10_4,That would make me very happy.
d_counseling_guillotine_10_5,The day I get married is the day I die.
d_counseling_guillotine_10_6,Is that so?
d_counseling_guillotine_10_7,"Well, whoever your soulmate is..."
d_counseling_guillotine_10_8,is a very lucky person.
d_counseling_guillotine_10_9,*Cough cough*
d_counseling_guillotine_10_10,I wasn't asking about marriage!
d_counseling_guillotine_10_11,I spend time with Guillotine talking about spouses.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_1,I heard there's a thunderstorm brewing up on the surface.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_2,Something doesn't feel right.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_3,It's simply the energy emanating from the Dragon of the Deep.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_4,There is a storm coming.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_5,So you felt it as well.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_6,Have you finally accepted the calling?
d_counseling_guillotine_11_7,Do you think this is just a natural phenomenon?
d_counseling_guillotine_11_8,You have much to learn.
d_counseling_guillotine_11_9,Guillotine and I speak more on the origin of the lightning storm.
d_counseling_guillotine_12_1,"Envy, jealousy, resentment..."
d_counseling_guillotine_12_2,I see it in the eyes of all who gaze upon me.
d_counseling_guillotine_12_3,How can I find solace from their judgment?
d_counseling_guillotine_12_4,It's too late for us to escape.
d_counseling_guillotine_12_5,Can we at least try to have a normal conversation?
d_counseling_guillotine_12_6,"I see, so this is yet another trial."
d_counseling_guillotine_12_7,We have always walked a different path from everyone else.
d_counseling_guillotine_12_8,"That is my destiny, and I will accept it."
d_counseling_guillotine_12_9,Communication...
d_counseling_guillotine_12_10,"I have tried so many times, but have never been able to breakthrough."
d_counseling_guillotine_12_11,"In the end, none of us can overcome the hand that we have been dealt."
d_counseling_guillotine_12_12,Guillotine and I have a conversation about fate.
d_counseling_guillotine_13_1,Something isn't right.
d_counseling_guillotine_13_2,"My hands are shaking, and I feel so anxious..."
d_counseling_guillotine_13_3,What is happening?
d_counseling_guillotine_13_4,Someone is sending you a signal from another dimension.
d_counseling_guillotine_13_5,You've got low blood sugar.
d_counseling_guillotine_13_6,!!
d_counseling_guillotine_13_7,This body's abilities have seeped into other dimensions?
d_counseling_guillotine_13_8,"Argh, my power is escaping me!"
d_counseling_guillotine_13_9,...
d_counseling_guillotine_13_10,"Anyway, got any chocolate Splendamin?"
d_counseling_guillotine_13_11,Guillotine and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_guillotine_14_1,Music is a good friend when you are alone.
d_counseling_guillotine_14_2,What kind of music do you listen to when you're on your own?
d_counseling_guillotine_14_3,Hymn of the Blood Moon.
d_counseling_guillotine_14_4,Perfect Pitch
d_counseling_guillotine_14_5,"That's a pretty famous song, but I'm still surprised you know it!"
d_counseling_guillotine_14_6,It's perfect for when you're gazing at a blood moon in real life. Brings a tear to your eye...
d_counseling_guillotine_14_7,"Hehe, we're not so different after all!"
d_counseling_guillotine_14_8,...
d_counseling_guillotine_14_9,"I thought I understood the preferences of normal people, but I guess not."
d_counseling_guillotine_14_10,Guillotine and I had a conversation about music.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_1,Sometimes I doubt whether I even truly exist.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_2,Do I exist? Who am I?
d_counseling_guillotine_15_3,"Partner,"
d_counseling_guillotine_15_4,who do you think I am?
d_counseling_guillotine_15_5,Guillotine de Mephisto.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_6,My partner in crime.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_7,Yes. I'm Guillotine de Mephisto.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_8,But what is a name but a mere jumbling together of letters?
d_counseling_guillotine_15_9,"If I were to change my name, would I become someone different?"
d_counseling_guillotine_15_10,!!
d_counseling_guillotine_15_11,You're right.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_12,"Forget the idea of Guillotine, forget everything."
d_counseling_guillotine_15_13,All I need to remember is that we are partners.
d_counseling_guillotine_15_14,Guillotine and I have a deep philosophical discussion about existence.
d_counseling_guillotine_16_1,I want to be alone.
d_counseling_guillotine_16_2,Just let me be.
d_counseling_guillotine_16_3,I won't let you suffer all alone!
d_counseling_guillotine_16_4,...
d_counseling_guillotine_16_5,...!
d_counseling_guillotine_16_6,Sigh... I knew you'd keep pestering me.
d_counseling_guillotine_16_7,Is this what they call comradery?
d_counseling_guillotine_16_8,...
d_counseling_guillotine_16_9,Hmmph.
d_counseling_guillotine_16_10,"Suddenly, I feel more lonely than before."
d_counseling_guillotine_16_11,I spend some lonely time with Guillotine.
d_counseling_guillotine_17_1,"If the world suddenly came to an end today,"
d_counseling_guillotine_17_2,how would you spend your last day?
d_counseling_guillotine_17_3,I'd spend it with you.
d_counseling_guillotine_17_4,I'd spend it by myself.
d_counseling_guillotine_17_5,"Thanks to you, this body will never be lonely."
d_counseling_guillotine_17_6,"When that day comes, we will finally be liberated from our solitary existence."
d_counseling_guillotine_17_7,"A toast, to the end of the world."
d_counseling_guillotine_17_8,So you would rather spend your last days in complete solitude?
d_counseling_guillotine_17_9,"If I leave you behind, I'll never find liberation."
d_counseling_guillotine_17_10,I too will follow you along this lonely path.
d_counseling_guillotine_17_11,Guillotine and I talk about our lonely fates.
d_counseling_guillotine_18_1,"If you had to choose between day or night,"
d_counseling_guillotine_18_2,which one would get the ax?
d_counseling_guillotine_18_3,Day is on the chopping block.
d_counseling_guillotine_18_4,Night is on the chopping block.
d_counseling_guillotine_18_5,"After all, we are creatures of the night."
d_counseling_guillotine_18_6,We are more accustomed to living in the dark.
d_counseling_guillotine_18_7,Therefore it's a natural choice for us to abandon the light of day.
d_counseling_guillotine_18_8,You've gone insane!
d_counseling_guillotine_18_9,Are you attempting to stand against the tides of fate?!
d_counseling_guillotine_18_10,Such a curse cannot be lifted so easily!
d_counseling_guillotine_18_11,I speak with Guillotine about the importance of day and night.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_1,My eye feels more uncomfortable than usual.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_2,Do you think it's all right to lift the seal for a moment?
d_counseling_guillotine_19_3,Not here!
d_counseling_guillotine_19_4,You'll be in a world of hurt with Ingrid.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_5,I should have figured as much.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_6,Are you worried I will go berserk?
d_counseling_guillotine_19_7,"Hehe, don't worry."
d_counseling_guillotine_19_8,You are my only deterrent.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_9,...
d_counseling_guillotine_19_10,There are many forces out there attempting to suppress this body.
d_counseling_guillotine_19_11,Guillotine and I speak about the frustration of being sealed away.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_1,The Big O is after me.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_2,Can I hide here momentarily?
d_counseling_guillotine_20_3,Sure.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_4,...?
d_counseling_guillotine_20_5,Thanks.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_6,They must have sensed my energy.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_7,They won't be able to follow me here.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_8,...
d_counseling_guillotine_20_9,I'll explain the details later.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_10,I would appreciate it if you stopped looking at me like that.
d_counseling_guillotine_20_11,Guillotine and I continued to have a discussion as we played Hide and Go Seek.
d_counseling_harran_01_1,"Have you heard the proverb, ""A pear drops when a crow flies from the tree""?"
d_counseling_harran_01_2,"It's fine if you don't understand what it means, but..."
d_counseling_harran_01_3,Tell me. What would you do if I blasted that crow out of the sky?
d_counseling_harran_01_4,I'd go pick up the pear.
d_counseling_harran_01_5,"I'd say, ""Bye bye, Crow."""
d_counseling_harran_01_6,Very good.
d_counseling_harran_01_7,You're smarter than you look.
d_counseling_harran_01_8,"I must say, you do amuse me from time to time."
d_counseling_harran_01_9,...
d_counseling_harran_01_10,Your courtesy can't hide your amusing lack of sense.
d_counseling_harran_01_11,Tsk.
d_counseling_harran_01_12,I hang out with Haran to continue amusing her.
d_counseling_harran_02_1,How does it feel living in that anthill you call the Ark?
d_counseling_harran_02_2,Are you really happy sheltered under that false sense of security?
d_counseling_harran_02_3,Or does the thought of the sky caving in at any moment fill you with terror?
d_counseling_harran_02_4,...
d_counseling_harran_02_5,"No matter where you are, it's all more or less the same."
d_counseling_harran_02_6,I knew you would have nothing intelligent to say.
d_counseling_harran_02_7,That's why I beckoned you here to me.
d_counseling_harran_02_8,"This way you can live up on the surface, in this utopia."
d_counseling_harran_02_9,Everywhere is the same?
d_counseling_harran_02_10,How can you say that?
d_counseling_harran_02_11,How can you compare human land to that vulgar place?
d_counseling_harran_02_12,You begin to irritate me.
d_counseling_harran_02_13,I talk with Harran a bit more.
d_counseling_harran_03_1,Noah is such an arrogant child.
d_counseling_harran_03_2,There are rumors that she has been perturbing my crow.
d_counseling_harran_03_3,What would you have me do?
d_counseling_harran_03_4,You ought to teach her a lesson.
d_counseling_harran_03_5,"You're an adult, so you should rise above all this and forgive her."
d_counseling_harran_03_6,Teach her lesson...
d_counseling_harran_03_7,"If I were on the receiving end, corporal punishment would not seem desirable."
d_counseling_harran_03_8,I suddenly feel as if I have been swayed by this child. Give me another idea.
d_counseling_harran_03_9,Wise.
d_counseling_harran_03_10,I mustn't allow myself to be affected by such childish acts.
d_counseling_harran_03_11,"Very well, I will forgive her. Just for you."
d_counseling_harran_03_12,"I talk with Harran a bit more, thinking about Noah."
d_counseling_harran_04_1,"Isabel has always been a good follower of yours, yes?"
d_counseling_harran_04_2,"She was always taken with you before, but it's gotten worse lately."
d_counseling_harran_04_3,"Tell me, what is it about you that has made her like this?"
d_counseling_harran_04_4,My devilish good looks?
d_counseling_harran_04_5,My charming personality?
d_counseling_harran_04_6,...
d_counseling_harran_04_7,You are very confident in yourself.
d_counseling_harran_04_8,"I suppose that could be the reason.
However, I'm no longer interested in this conversation. Let's not discuss it any further."
d_counseling_harran_04_9,I must admit...
d_counseling_harran_04_10,your way of thinking is rather novel.
d_counseling_harran_04_11,That is why I'm fond of you.
d_counseling_harran_04_12,"I talk with Harran a bit more, thinking about Isabel."
d_counseling_harran_05_1,"You said that you were part of the Central Government, yes?"
d_counseling_harran_05_2,"How is it, working for them? Any fun?"
d_counseling_harran_05_3,It's fine.
d_counseling_harran_05_4,It's a real drag.
d_counseling_harran_05_5,It's... fine?
d_counseling_harran_05_6,I didn't expect you to enjoy something so despicable.
d_counseling_harran_05_7,"I can't tell if it's merely because you are so good that you rise above it,"
d_counseling_harran_05_8,or if you really do revel in the filth along with them.
d_counseling_harran_05_9,Is that so?
d_counseling_harran_05_10,It is as I thought.
d_counseling_harran_05_11,You're different from the rest of those filthy cretins.
d_counseling_harran_05_12,I hear more about Haran's hatred towards the Central Government.
d_counseling_harran_06_1,The Outpost is quite an interesting place.
d_counseling_harran_06_2,"It's neither part of the Ark nor the surface, yet it's full of Nikkes."
d_counseling_harran_06_3,Are you happy being here?
d_counseling_harran_06_4,I am.
d_counseling_harran_06_5,I am not.
d_counseling_harran_06_6,How boring.
d_counseling_harran_06_7,Is it that you're greedy?
d_counseling_harran_06_8,Or have you just given up already?
d_counseling_harran_06_9,Of course you aren't.
d_counseling_harran_06_10,"It doesn't have any wide-open spaces like the surface, nor a real sky."
d_counseling_harran_06_11,You'll just have to wait a bit longer.
d_counseling_harran_06_12,One day I'll let you live up on the surface.
d_counseling_harran_06_13,I talk more with Harran about the Outpost.
d_counseling_harran_07_1,Tell me the truth.
d_counseling_harran_07_2,Do you agree that I am the most important thing in the world?
d_counseling_harran_07_3,I do.
d_counseling_harran_07_4,...
d_counseling_harran_07_5,Yes. Good. That is how you should be.
d_counseling_harran_07_6,"I've told you to hide nothing from me, and I know you will do whatever I say, so I believe you."
d_counseling_harran_07_7,You are indeed qualified to stand by my side.
d_counseling_harran_07_8,I see. Then your belief in me is not firm enough.
d_counseling_harran_07_9,"Nevertheless, it could be worse."
d_counseling_harran_07_10,"If you had said no, I would never let you lay eyes on me again."
d_counseling_harran_07_11,I spend some meaningful time together with Harran.
d_counseling_harran_08_1,"Now, a question."
d_counseling_harran_08_2,What flavor do you think I would like?
d_counseling_harran_08_3,Nothing could satisfy you.
d_counseling_harran_08_4,The taste of blood?
d_counseling_harran_08_5,How did you know?
d_counseling_harran_08_6,"That's correct. I have no strong preference when it comes to flavor, good or bad."
d_counseling_harran_08_7,I can tell that you are quite interested in me. Is that right?
d_counseling_harran_08_8,I like that very much.
d_counseling_harran_08_9,Blood?
d_counseling_harran_08_10,I don't go around splashing blood everywhere.
d_counseling_harran_08_11,"I prefer a clean kill, yet you say I like blood?"
d_counseling_harran_08_12,"If this is your attempt at humor, then I'm not laughing."
d_counseling_harran_08_13,I talk more with Harran about taste.
d_counseling_harran_09_1,"As you know, my weapon was crafted on the surface."
d_counseling_harran_09_2,Do you think the weaponry from the Ark
d_counseling_harran_09_3,can compare to mine?
d_counseling_harran_09_4,Yes.
d_counseling_harran_09_5,No.
d_counseling_harran_09_6,How foolish of you.
d_counseling_harran_09_7,Is this because you're from the Ark?
d_counseling_harran_09_8,"You amuse me, but don't get too smart with me."
d_counseling_harran_09_9,I'm not above making an example out of you.
d_counseling_harran_09_10,Precisely.
d_counseling_harran_09_11,They're in completely different leagues. How could you possibly compare them?
d_counseling_harran_09_12,Never forget that this powerful weapon of mine is at your service.
d_counseling_harran_09_13,I talk more with Harran about weapons.
d_counseling_harran_10_1,Do you remember the first time I came to you?
d_counseling_harran_10_2,How did you feel?
d_counseling_harran_10_3,I was happy.
d_counseling_harran_10_4,It was incredible.
d_counseling_harran_10_5,As you should be.
d_counseling_harran_10_6,You must have been beside yourself with excitement.
d_counseling_harran_10_7,"In that case, you may stay with me a bit longer."
d_counseling_harran_10_8,Incredible?
d_counseling_harran_10_9,Hm. I suppose it would be.
d_counseling_harran_10_10,You haven't met anyone like me in your entire life.
d_counseling_harran_10_11,I understand your feelings.
d_counseling_harran_10_12,I reminisce with Harran about the first time we met.
d_counseling_harran_11_1,What's your favorite kind of weather?
d_counseling_harran_11_2,"Wait, is there even such a thing as the weather in that dismal hole you call a city?"
d_counseling_harran_11_3,We have artificial weather.
d_counseling_harran_11_4,...
d_counseling_harran_11_5,You must be joking.
d_counseling_harran_11_6,How can you compare that to the real thing?
d_counseling_harran_11_7,They're worlds apart.
d_counseling_harran_11_8,Don't feel so down.
d_counseling_harran_11_9,"If you want, I'll take you up to the surface and"
d_counseling_harran_11_10,"show you everything. The snow, the rain..."
d_counseling_harran_11_11,Harran and I have a conversation about the weather.
d_counseling_harran_12_1,Why do humans constantly lie
d_counseling_harran_12_2,and betray one another?
d_counseling_harran_12_3,Not everyone is that way.
d_counseling_harran_12_4,I don't know what to say.
d_counseling_harran_12_5,I realize that.
d_counseling_harran_12_6,And I know you represent one of those humans.
d_counseling_harran_12_7,So you don't need to worry.
d_counseling_harran_12_8,You don't have to say anything.
d_counseling_harran_12_9,Do you think I don't know there are plenty of humans who don't act like that?
d_counseling_harran_12_10,I am well aware of the type of human you are.
d_counseling_harran_12_11,So do not be foolish and feel ashamed when you have nothing to be ashamed about.
d_counseling_harran_12_12,Harran and I have a conversation about humans and their penchant for lying.
d_counseling_harran_13_1,"Follower,"
d_counseling_harran_13_2,who is the fairest of them all?
d_counseling_harran_13_3,... Snow White?
d_counseling_harran_13_4,You.
d_counseling_harran_13_5,Are you serious?
d_counseling_harran_13_6,Snow White? The one who wanders around wearing those tattered rags?
d_counseling_harran_13_7,Maybe it could be Dorothy...
d_counseling_harran_13_8,"No, that's not it either."
d_counseling_harran_13_9,Did Snow White put you up to this?
d_counseling_harran_13_10,Tell me the truth.
d_counseling_harran_13_11,"Haha, you're very perceptive."
d_counseling_harran_13_12,"You told me exactly what I wanted to hear, and I didn't have to spell it out."
d_counseling_harran_13_13,You know how to put me in a good mood.
d_counseling_harran_13_14,"Harran and I decide to try and make a poisonous apple, like the one from Snow White."
d_counseling_harran_14_1,You must be hungry by now.
d_counseling_harran_14_2,Would you like me to make some witch's brew?
d_counseling_harran_14_3,"No, thanks."
d_counseling_harran_14_4,"Yes, please."
d_counseling_harran_14_5,I refuse to believe you don't want to try my witch's brew.
d_counseling_harran_14_6,Are you just being polite and saying you're not hungry?
d_counseling_harran_14_7,"Well, don't be."
d_counseling_harran_14_8,"My goodness, not even a polite refusal. You must be starving."
d_counseling_harran_14_9,How adorable.
d_counseling_harran_14_10,I pounded down several bowls of the soup Harran gave me.
d_counseling_harran_15_1,This is the new perfume I concocted.
d_counseling_harran_15_2,Spray-spray-spray-
d_counseling_harran_15_3,"Well, what do you think? Am I more captivating now?"
d_counseling_harran_15_4,Very much so.
d_counseling_harran_15_5,"You've always been endlessly alluring, Harran."
d_counseling_harran_15_6,...
d_counseling_harran_15_7,"Hmm... You're saying all the right words, but"
d_counseling_harran_15_8,somehow I feel like you're just telling me what I want to hear.
d_counseling_harran_15_9,!!
d_counseling_harran_15_10,"It wasn't the answer I was looking for, but I like it."
d_counseling_harran_15_11,Compliments are always nicer when they're unexpected.
d_counseling_harran_15_12,I continue to shower Harran with compliments.
d_counseling_harran_16_1,What I like most about the surface is that
d_counseling_harran_16_2,it's truly survival of the fittest.
d_counseling_harran_16_3,Don't you agree?
d_counseling_harran_16_4,Absolutely.
d_counseling_harran_16_5,I'm not sure.
d_counseling_harran_16_6,"Hehe, your face tells me you're not so sure."
d_counseling_harran_16_7,You don't have to pretend to understand.
d_counseling_harran_16_8,It's easy to see that you're at the bottom of the food chain.
d_counseling_harran_16_9,"Hehe, yes, I imagine you don't quite understand."
d_counseling_harran_16_10,That kind of honesty is what I like about you.
d_counseling_harran_16_11,Harran and I have a conversation about the rules of nature.
d_counseling_harran_17_1,Follower.
d_counseling_harran_17_2,Do you think we'll ever see the day where there are no Raptures on the surface?
d_counseling_harran_17_3,I believe we will.
d_counseling_harran_17_4,I'm not too sure.
d_counseling_harran_17_5,Yes...perhaps one day.
d_counseling_harran_17_6,"Rather than risking your life for no reason,"
d_counseling_harran_17_7,"it's better to have a dream to work towards, no matter how implausible it may seem."
d_counseling_harran_17_8,You must keep believing in that.
d_counseling_harran_17_9,"If you have any uncertainty,"
d_counseling_harran_17_10,that means you're risking your life without even knowing exactly why you're doing it.
d_counseling_harran_17_11,You poor thing.
d_counseling_harran_17_12,I have a conversation with Harran about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_harran_18_1,A few days ago I encountered an abandoned Nikke up on the surface who was on the verge of death.
d_counseling_harran_18_2,Do you know what she said to me?
d_counseling_harran_18_3,She wanted to return to the time before she was a Nikke.
d_counseling_harran_18_4,Have you ever wanted to go back to the past?
d_counseling_harran_18_5,"Sure, there are times when I've wanted to go back."
d_counseling_harran_18_6,"For me, the past should remain in the past."
d_counseling_harran_18_7,But what good does getting lost in the past do you?
d_counseling_harran_18_8,"If you're unhappy with your past, then make up for it in the here and now."
d_counseling_harran_18_9,You're right.
d_counseling_harran_18_10,There's no point in trying to go back and fix what has already happened.
d_counseling_harran_18_11,"If you're unhappy with your past, then make up for it in the here and now."
d_counseling_harran_18_12,"If you ever feel like doing that, let me know."
d_counseling_harran_18_13,I'll do whatever I can to help.
d_counseling_harran_18_14,I spend some time with Harran reminiscing about the past.
d_counseling_harran_19_1,Follower.
d_counseling_harran_19_2,Do you prefer red or blue?
d_counseling_harran_19_3,Red.
d_counseling_harran_19_4,Blue.
d_counseling_harran_19_5,"Hehe, we think alike."
d_counseling_harran_19_6,I'm glad you said that.
d_counseling_harran_19_7,I want to make this next bottle of perfume red.
d_counseling_harran_19_8,Tsk.
d_counseling_harran_19_9,"If you'd said red, I was going to pretend as if I had no choice but to change the color."
d_counseling_harran_19_10,"But fine, I guess it's blue yet again."
d_counseling_harran_19_11,I helped Harran make perfume.
d_counseling_harran_20_1,"Between you and my raven,"
d_counseling_harran_20_2,who do you think makes a better follower?
d_counseling_harran_20_3,... The raven.
d_counseling_harran_20_4,Of course it's me.
d_counseling_harran_20_5,Hmmm? Why are you so down?
d_counseling_harran_20_6,You're a perfectly fine follower.
d_counseling_harran_20_7,"So chin up, and believe in yourself a little more."
d_counseling_harran_20_8,Where do you get such confidence?
d_counseling_harran_20_9,"Hehe, very well then."
d_counseling_harran_20_10,"I'm not sure about everything else, but at the very least, I enjoy that you're more confident than my raven."
d_counseling_harran_20_11,"Harran and I have a conversation about the duties of a follower, and of her raven."
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_1,"Tell me, my Lord. Which do you prefer?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_2,"Bitter spirits, or sweet?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_3,Sweet!
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_4,Bitter!
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_5,So you are still partial to alcohol's sweet embrace?
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_6,"My Lord, you are but a novice still."
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_7,Never have truer words been spoken! Spirits are much like life itself.
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_8,One adjusts to life's ebb and flow much in the way you allow the bitterness of spirits to ease down your gullet.
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_9,"You possess a greater mind than your looks let on, my Lord!"
d_counseling_hongryeon_01_10,I spend time with Scarlet and share a drunken conversation.
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_1,"My Lord, do you fancy the Outpost?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_2,"Yes, I do."
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_3,"No, I don't."
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_4,I see. So it is very much to my Lord's liking.
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_5,Because this is my Lord's home.
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_6,Is that so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_7,"If I may say so, I myself am not partial to this particular locale."
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_8,"There is no sky, no moonlight, no wind here."
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_9,It's all rather stuffy.
d_counseling_hongryeon_02_10,I have a conversation with Scarlet about the Outpost.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_1,"My Lord, are you not taken with how Fleetly Fading"
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_2,doth cleave through Raptures with such aplomb?
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_3,"Yes, it's truly fascinating."
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_4,That's just what blades do.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_5,As it very well should be.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_6,"As it stands, the Ark would never endorse the usage of such a dangerous method."
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_7,Much blood and many tears were shed in order to acquire this blade.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_8,Perhaps the fact that these sacrifices have ceased
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_9,is what lies behind my Lord's fascination.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_10,Is that so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_11,"You are a strange bird indeed, my Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_12,Most humans tend to be wary when faced with the unfamiliar.
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_13,"Yet the same cannot be said of you, my Lord. Most peculiar indeed."
d_counseling_hongryeon_03_14,I have a conversation with Scarlet about Fleetly Fading.
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_1,What is my Lord's opinion on farming?
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_2,It would be a rewarding job.
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_3,Just hearing that word makes my body ache.
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_4,My thoughts exactly!
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_5,"We give the land our labor, and the land provides us with sustenance."
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_6,"Certainly there is no reward more certain, more logical than this."
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_7,Could this be due to my Lord never having been trained on a daily basis?
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_8,"I must say, I expected my Lord to have a better appreciation of the philosophy behind tending the land."
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_9,The thought saddens me.
d_counseling_hongryeon_04_10,I have a conversation with Scarlet about farming.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_1,Snow White appears to be having have a hard time. She must scrounge for morsels to call a feast.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_2,She would be wise to take some of that time spent dispatching Raptures
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_3,"and instead devote it to farming, so that she does not starve."
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_4,Why don't you farm for her?
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_5,She doesn't need sympathy. This is the life she chose.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_6,"That, I cannot do."
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_7,We have agreed not to involve ourselves in each other's lives.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_8,Living a life of starvation is what Snow White chose.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_9,"The moment we intervene,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_10,we are then meddling in her life.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_11,"Therefore, I shan't ever do anything in her stead."
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_12,Precisely. Sympathy is for fools.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_13,This is the life that Snow White has chosen.
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_14,"I have learned something from you today, my Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_05_15,I have a conversation with Scarlet about Snow White.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_1,I met Rapunzel at our regular meeting this month.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_2,"She was practically drooling over you, my Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_3,What has transpired between the two of you?
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_4,I have become a victim of her fantasy.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_5,She and I are indulging in a pleasant fantasy.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_6,Good heavens.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_7,"You have truly been put through the wringer, my Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_8,"But alas, that is merely Rapunzel's way of showing affection."
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_9,Yes. Word of you becoming the subject of Rapunzel's fantasy has reached my ears.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_10,Have you been enjoying it?
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_11,My Lord is certainly more... open-minded than I imagined.
d_counseling_hongryeon_06_12,I have a conversation with Scarlet about Rapunzel.
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_1,"Tell me, my Lord, and be honest..."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_2,are you positive you do not wish to spend your days on the surface?
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_3,"I've considered it, but I don't think I can."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_4,I don't want to think about it.
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_5,"I see. Very well, then."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_6,My Lord has much to protect. I understand that.
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_7,"That is one thing I admire about you, my Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_8,I eagerly await your return to the surface.
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_9,Haha! You are most adamant.
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_10,"If that is the case, then I am afraid there is nothing much I can do."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_11,"If however, you one day have a change of heart, do come and find me."
d_counseling_hongryeon_07_12,I chat with Scarlet while thinking about life up on the surface.
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_1,"Hic... well met, my Lord!"
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_2,Fancy a drop or two?
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_3,"Sure, I'll have a drink."
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_4,I think you've had enough for tonight.
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_5,Hic... excellent! As a good Lord should!
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_6,Looks like you know how to have a little fun after all!
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_7,Don't say that! I haven't drunk that much.
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_8,"My Lord knows how to be a spoilsport, it seems."
d_counseling_hongryeon_08_9,I have a cheerful time with Scarlet.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_1,"Tell me, my Lord. What do you think goes best with spirits?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_2,Moonlight and the wind?
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_3,Delicious food.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_4,Precisely!
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_5,There is nothing greater than imbibing spirits while basking in nature.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_6,"I had you pegged for a tenderfoot, but I had you all wrong!"
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_7,A fine choice.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_8,There's a surfeit of delicious morsels up on the surface.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_9,They and spirits make for fine bedfellows.
d_counseling_hongryeon_09_10,I chat with Scarlet about what goes best with alcohol.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_1,Be honest with me.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_2,Do you have a lady in your life?
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_3,"Yes, a drunkard who wanders the surface."
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_4,No one in particular.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_5,"A drunkard who wanders the surface, you say..."
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_6,Is it me?
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_7,"Haha! Oh, that makes me very happy, indeed."
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_8,Very good! Today I will drink to celebrate the fact that
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_9,my Lord has chosen to make me his Lady!
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_10,Hmm... I suppose you have no intention of telling me.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_11,I was hoping this could be our topic of discussion while we drank.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_12,What a pity.
d_counseling_hongryeon_10_13,I drink with Scarlet while we share a casual conversation.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_1,"When ye have imbibed one's fair share of spirits, what typically proceeds?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_2,I go to sleep.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_3,I end up crying my eyes out.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_4,A most ordinary response.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_5,"Yes, surely a desirable habit to have in one's company."
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_6,"I must ask ye, what dost thou imagine mine habits are whilst in a state of inebriation?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_7,Spirits do reveal the emotions trapped inside us all.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_8,Allowing the tears to flow when one must is paramount.
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_9,"Should one keep it bottled up for too long, ye might manifest stomach ulcers and the like."
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_10,"I shan't be the most proficient in comforting those in need,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_11,"but I am a most capable drinking companion, so do reach out to me when the time is right."
d_counseling_hongryeon_11_12,Scarlet and I have a conversation about drinking habits.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_1,Snow White inquired unto me what I find so enchanting about drinking.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_2,"Tell me, my good fellow, why do you drink?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_3,I like the taste.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_4,To get drunk.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_5,"Indeed, spirits are a most intoxicating elixir."
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_6,It is most upsetting that others of the female persuasion shan't appreciate its flavor.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_7,"To that end, I brought some of the finest spirits with me. Would you perchance care to have a nip?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_8,To imbibe simply to be three sheets to the wind is a rather trying experience on one's body.
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_9,"There are as many flavors of spirit as there are stars in the sky, and you can have your pick of the lot."
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_10,"However, one must take care not to overdo it, as inebriation must not be one's end goal."
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_11,"With that being said, why don't we have a drink?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_12_12,Scarlet and I had a conversation about different flavors of alcohol.
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_1,"To drink inquietude is most pleasurable,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_2,"but to drink in revelry, accompanied by music, can be quite alluring as well."
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_3,"When ye takes to the bottle, what music dost thou prefer to listen to?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_4,"Jazz music, to help set the mood."
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_5,Folk music that has a good feel to it.
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_6,I see.
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_7,"Perhaps not in alignment with mine own preference, but thou doth piqued mine interest."
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_8,Let our ears take in the dulcet tones of jazz next time we indulge in the spirits.
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_9,So you also are one for folk music!
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_10,"Let us indulge in spirits under the moonlight, all accompanied by the dulcet tones of folk melodies."
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_11,I shall bring the finest spirits that suit the music.
d_counseling_hongryeon_13_12,Scarlet and I talk about what type of music goes well with alcohol.
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_1,"I must say, the weather up on the surface has been most inclement."
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_2,What say ye to imbibing the spirits on a rainy day?
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_3,I think it's perfectly acceptable to drink on a rainy day.
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_4,I personally think it's better to drink on a sunny day.
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_5,I see.
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_6,"Indeed, to enjoy the bottle amidst the rainfall is an experience like no other. Poetic, emotional..."
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_7,"However, as mine eyes shan't chance upon the light of the moon, I do not prefer it."
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_8,"It is as I thought. You and I are peas in a pod, my good fellow."
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_9,"To drink on a clear day is ideal, as only then can one capture the moonlight in one's glass."
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_10,The moonlight and a gentle breeze are perfect bedfellows for a fine glass of spirits.
d_counseling_hongryeon_14_11,Scarlet and I talk about what we think is the perfect drinking weather.
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_1,"If perchance one day we doth succeed in reclaiming the surface, what shall ye do with the days that remain?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_2,I'd be content living a quiet life on my own patch of land.
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_3,I'd want to spend it with the friends that are closest to me.
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_4,A fine notion indeed.
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_5,"Up until now, thy life has been one full of strife and fractiousness."
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_6,"The day will come when we can bask in the light of the sun, and the moon alike."
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_7,Ye will live a life much different than mine.
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_8,"As it stands, the surface is a land of great strife and disarray."
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_9,"When this all comes to an end, mine greatest desire is to live a quiet life."
d_counseling_hongryeon_15_10,Scarlet and I dreamt about the future.
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_1,"My good fellow, what are your views on romance?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_2,"Given the sad state of our world, is it something we must have?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_3,Or does it not have a place in the world as it is?
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_4,"As soon as you start overanalyzing it, any romance ceases to exist."
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_5,I think you could make a case for both.
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_6,I see.
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_7,I cannot deny the truth in your words.
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_8,"The moment one begins to ponder such matters, they are drained of any semblance of romance."
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_9,"Well then, let us drink to romance on this day."
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_10,"Haha, you would not perchance be reticent on siding with either argument, would you?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_11,"In an ideal world, perhaps you could get by with such a vague answer."
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_12,"It is, however, not suitable for a world in which thy life is constantly in peril."
d_counseling_hongryeon_16_13,Scarlet and I debate the meaning of romance.
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_1,"My good fellow, what say ye about"
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_2,drinking until one loses one's faculties?
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_3,"When someone drinks to excess, there is always a reason behind it."
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_4,"To me, that's allowing alcohol to consume you."
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_5,I see.
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_6,"I dare not attempt to presume what others are going through,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_7,"but when one begins to depend on the spirits, it is most undesirable. Thy memory goes blank, despite there being no vicissitudes in the outside world."
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_8,Our minds are one with this issue.
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_9,"I am the one consuming the alcohol, not the other way around."
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_10,"So, let us raise our glasses and drink. Ye and I shall be the ones in command of the bottle."
d_counseling_hongryeon_17_11,Scarlet and I enjoyed a drink.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_1,Many lives are at play in the realm of agriculture.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_2,I smite the pests that afflict my crops. I drive out or slay the beasts that roam my fields.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_3,"There are those to whom farming is but a puritanical pursuit, one which the stench of death does not penetrate. They are mistaken."
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_4,"Tell me, my good fellow,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_5,What says ye about achieving something from the sacrifice of something else?
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_6,There must be another way.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_7,Sacrifice is inevitable.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_8,"Aye, should I be thee, I would feel the same."
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_9,But I myself believe nothing can be accomplished without sacrifice.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_10,I hope that one day ye shall come to this realization as well.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_11,It is truly so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_12,"Aye, I feel the same as thee, but"
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_13,it is not an answer that warms the cockles of mine heart.
d_counseling_hongryeon_18_14,Scarlet teaches me about various farming methods.
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_1,"Perchance this is a foolish inquiry, but"
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_2,hath ye ever felt as if thine and another were intertwined in some way?
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_3,"Yes, I have."
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_4,"No, I haven't."
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_5,Is that so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_6,That is why I have felt a connection with you from the very beginning.
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_7,We must partake in the bottle the next time we meet.
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_8,Is that so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_9,"To live such a life, would be freedom incarnate."
d_counseling_hongryeon_19_10,Scarlet and I have a conversation about fate.
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_1,"My good fellow,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_2,"up on the surface, flowers bloom as far as the eye can see."
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_3,Would ye perchance express any interest in gazing upon them?
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_4,You go on ahead. I'll follow you.
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_5,I have other things I have to take care of.
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_6,Very well.
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_7,"I shall find the perfect place, and await your arrival."
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_8,"You shall have a glass of spirits awaiting you, do not keep it waiting long!"
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_9,By the heavens...
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_10,ye have but nary a shrivel of appreciation for sentimentality.
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_11,"I shan't say whether such a thing is unfortunate, or merely pitiable."
d_counseling_hongryeon_20_12,I have a conversation with Scarlet about going to see the flowers.
d_counseling_isabel_01_1,...
d_counseling_isabel_01_2,...
d_counseling_isabel_01_3,Why are you just staring at me?
d_counseling_isabel_01_4,Is there something on my face?
d_counseling_isabel_01_5,Ah... Sorry!
d_counseling_isabel_01_6,"It's just that... you look so handsome today, Darling."
d_counseling_isabel_01_7,"N-no, it's not that..."
d_counseling_isabel_01_8,But now that you mention it... I think I do see a little something.
d_counseling_isabel_01_9,"Here, come closer so I can get it."
d_counseling_isabel_01_10,I spend some peaceful time together with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_02_1,Hm? What's bothering me?
d_counseling_isabel_02_2,... I... I don't know.
d_counseling_isabel_02_3,Maybe it's that there are so many women around you all the time?
d_counseling_isabel_02_4,"My relationship with them is strictly professional, nothing more."
d_counseling_isabel_02_5,...
d_counseling_isabel_02_6,Liar...
d_counseling_isabel_02_7,"However, a little white lie is more palatable than a bitter truth."
d_counseling_isabel_02_8,"If you don't mind, I hope you can keep lying to me like that."
d_counseling_isabel_02_9,... Why aren't you saying anything?
d_counseling_isabel_02_10,"In the future, Darling, you should prepare your alibi in advance."
d_counseling_isabel_02_11,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_03_1,My commander is terribly strict with me.
d_counseling_isabel_03_2,Why would they do that to me?
d_counseling_isabel_03_3,Could just be their personality.
d_counseling_isabel_03_4,They want to keep a certain distance between them and their subordinates.
d_counseling_isabel_03_5,"When you put it like that, it really takes a weight off my chest."
d_counseling_isabel_03_6,I had thought I was doing something wrong.
d_counseling_isabel_03_7,But...
d_counseling_isabel_03_8,"After all we've been through together, is there still a need to keep our distance?"
d_counseling_isabel_03_9,Everyone in Eden is like this...
d_counseling_isabel_03_10,I listen to Isabel's concerns for a while longer.
d_counseling_isabel_04_1,"Darling,"
d_counseling_isabel_04_2,have I done something to upset you?
d_counseling_isabel_04_3,No.
d_counseling_isabel_04_4,...
d_counseling_isabel_04_5,Ah. I'm glad.
d_counseling_isabel_04_6,I thought you were quiet because you were getting bored with me.
d_counseling_isabel_04_7,"Darling,"
d_counseling_isabel_04_8,"every single thing I do,"
d_counseling_isabel_04_9,is all for your sake. I want to protect the one I love.
d_counseling_isabel_04_10,I hope you can understand that.
d_counseling_isabel_04_11,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_05_1,I can't stand it!
d_counseling_isabel_05_2,How come there's only one of you?
d_counseling_isabel_05_3,"If only there was one more of you, I could hide the other you in a safe, secret place and love you forever."
d_counseling_isabel_05_4,That sounds... terrifying.
d_counseling_isabel_05_5,Who knows what the future holds?
d_counseling_isabel_05_6,I was only joking. Ha! Ha!
d_counseling_isabel_05_7,...
d_counseling_isabel_05_8,The future...
d_counseling_isabel_05_9,what might the future hold?
d_counseling_isabel_05_10,It's so exciting to imagine! I won't be able to sleep tonight!
d_counseling_isabel_05_11,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_06_1,That Noah is so disrespectful.
d_counseling_isabel_06_2,I can't stand it when she's rude to you!
d_counseling_isabel_06_3,It doesn't bother me.
d_counseling_isabel_06_4,"It caught me off-guard, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate her."
d_counseling_isabel_06_5,... You are so gentle and kind.
d_counseling_isabel_06_6,That's precisely why I can't forgive anyone who is rude to you.
d_counseling_isabel_06_7,...?
d_counseling_isabel_06_8,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_isabel_06_9,I don't understand what you're getting at...
d_counseling_isabel_06_10,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_07_1,"Darling,"
d_counseling_isabel_07_2,"don't you feel stifled, living underground?"
d_counseling_isabel_07_3,I've gotten used to it.
d_counseling_isabel_07_4,Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode.
d_counseling_isabel_07_5,Hm...
d_counseling_isabel_07_6,I've learned something new about you.
d_counseling_isabel_07_7,Is that so?
d_counseling_isabel_07_8,"If the stress gets to be too much, just come and see me."
d_counseling_isabel_07_9,We can fly high in the sky. I'll take you somewhere far away.
d_counseling_isabel_07_10,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_08_1,Can I ask you...
d_counseling_isabel_08_2,What... do you think about marriage?
d_counseling_isabel_08_3,It's two people intertwining into one.
d_counseling_isabel_08_4,It's the result of true love.
d_counseling_isabel_08_5,...!!
d_counseling_isabel_08_6,You feel the same way I do.
d_counseling_isabel_08_7,You and I were destined to be together.
d_counseling_isabel_08_8,...!!
d_counseling_isabel_08_9,My feelings are... a little different from yours.
d_counseling_isabel_08_10,"What I mean is... yes, love is where it all begins, but..."
d_counseling_isabel_08_11,We never know when emotions like that can disappear.
d_counseling_isabel_08_12,I talk with Isabel about the value of marriage.
d_counseling_isabel_09_1,"I want to know more about you, Darling."
d_counseling_isabel_09_2,Tell me something about you. Anything.
d_counseling_isabel_09_3,I graduated from a military academy.
d_counseling_isabel_09_4,There's nothing I love more than a blue sky.
d_counseling_isabel_09_5,A military academy... just like my commander.
d_counseling_isabel_09_6,"So, he shares a special connection with you..."
d_counseling_isabel_09_7,I envy him.
d_counseling_isabel_09_8,"Really? Me, too!"
d_counseling_isabel_09_9,"Even as a human, I longed to explore the skies."
d_counseling_isabel_09_10,Maybe that's why I was given these wings when I became a Nikke.
d_counseling_isabel_09_11,I have a happy conversation with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_10_1,What do you think it would be like... to have a family?
d_counseling_isabel_10_2,You'd feel like you have others to protect.
d_counseling_isabel_10_3,You'd feel like you have a home to come back to.
d_counseling_isabel_10_4,...!!
d_counseling_isabel_10_5,You have such a strong sense of responsibility.
d_counseling_isabel_10_6,I wonder... what would having a family with you be like? I'm sure it would be bliss.
d_counseling_isabel_10_7,*Sigh*
d_counseling_isabel_10_8,I've been struggling my entire life to find a home like that.
d_counseling_isabel_10_9,"Yet, some people are blessed with it from day one."
d_counseling_isabel_10_10,I have a deep discussion with Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_11_1,"You look so tired today, darling."
d_counseling_isabel_11_2,Come here and I'll give you a hug.
d_counseling_isabel_11_3,That's okay.
d_counseling_isabel_11_4,...
d_counseling_isabel_11_5,!!
d_counseling_isabel_11_6,"I'm sorry, I suffered a mental lapse... It's just that my desire to touch you is so strong."
d_counseling_isabel_11_7,What I should be doing is getting rid of whatever is troubling you.
d_counseling_isabel_11_8,"Just say the word, and I'll take care of whatever, or whoever, it is."
d_counseling_isabel_11_9,You poor soul.
d_counseling_isabel_11_10,Isabel came toward me and hugged me.
d_counseling_isabel_11_11,"There there, no need to worry. Isabel is here."
d_counseling_isabel_11_12,I'll go and take care of whatever is bothering you.
d_counseling_isabel_11_13,"During our conversation, I had to talk down the overexcited Isabel."
d_counseling_isabel_12_1,Such pristine weather we're having!
d_counseling_isabel_12_2,"With you, on a day like this..."
d_counseling_isabel_12_3,Want to go on a trip?
d_counseling_isabel_12_4,Want to go eat something?
d_counseling_isabel_12_5,!!
d_counseling_isabel_12_6,"You're not a mind reader by any chance, are you?"
d_counseling_isabel_12_7,Going on a trip with you...
d_counseling_isabel_12_8,"Oh, how I have longed for this day!"
d_counseling_isabel_12_9,It's finally coming true!
d_counseling_isabel_12_10,"That would work too, but"
d_counseling_isabel_12_11,I was hoping we could spend more time together.
d_counseling_isabel_12_12,Or is that just a pipe dream?
d_counseling_isabel_12_13,Isabel and I plan a trip together.
d_counseling_isabel_13_1,Honey.
d_counseling_isabel_13_2,"You've been working so hard, I made you a little something to drink."
d_counseling_isabel_13_3,Have a little sip!
d_counseling_isabel_13_4,Take a sip.
d_counseling_isabel_13_5,Don't drink.
d_counseling_isabel_13_6,My vision started to blur.
d_counseling_isabel_13_7,Are you all right?
d_counseling_isabel_13_8,I think so.
d_counseling_isabel_13_9,Oh... you are?
d_counseling_isabel_13_10,... Darn.
d_counseling_isabel_13_11,Just one sip! Is that so hard?
d_counseling_isabel_13_12,I'm not thirsty.
d_counseling_isabel_13_13,... Fine.
d_counseling_isabel_13_14,I should have waited until you were thirsty.
d_counseling_isabel_13_15,Maybe next time.
d_counseling_isabel_13_16,I spend time with Isabel feeling touched and terrified in equal measure.
d_counseling_isabel_14_1,If it were a special occasion and
d_counseling_isabel_14_2,"you wanted to celebrate it with someone,"
d_counseling_isabel_14_3,who would you want to be with?
d_counseling_isabel_14_4,Um... You?
d_counseling_isabel_14_5,Um... The Counters squad?
d_counseling_isabel_14_6,"Really, just me?"
d_counseling_isabel_14_7,I'm so touched!
d_counseling_isabel_14_8,Although the lack of confidence in your answer makes me raise my eyebrows a little.
d_counseling_isabel_14_9,"But then again, such reticence could be another sign of your affection!"
d_counseling_isabel_14_10,*Click*
d_counseling_isabel_14_11,"You'd prefer to celebrate a special occasion with not one, but three women? All of whom aren't me?"
d_counseling_isabel_14_12,"You're not being serious, are you?"
d_counseling_isabel_14_13,"That must be why you didn't sound so sure in your response, right?"
d_counseling_isabel_14_14,I nodded my head.
d_counseling_isabel_14_15,"Phew... That's what I was hoping. Sorry, I guess I'm not used to your sense of humor yet."
d_counseling_isabel_14_16,"If you had been telling the truth, I was going to go bust some skulls. Namely those three girls!"
d_counseling_isabel_14_17,I'm glad you were only joking.
d_counseling_isabel_14_18,I calmed down the agitated Isabel.
d_counseling_isabel_15_1,"If you were to do a home renovation, would you choose a clean, monotone style"
d_counseling_isabel_15_2,or something cozy with lots of woodwork?
d_counseling_isabel_15_3,Clean and monotone.
d_counseling_isabel_15_4,Cozy and with lots of woodwork.
d_counseling_isabel_15_5,!!
d_counseling_isabel_15_6,You don't say?
d_counseling_isabel_15_7,I thought the other style would suit your personality better...
d_counseling_isabel_15_8,"Sorry, I'll change it right away."
d_counseling_isabel_15_9,Really?
d_counseling_isabel_15_10,"I feel the same way. If I were to share a house with someone I'm fond of (like you),"
d_counseling_isabel_15_11,you want it to be nice and cozy.
d_counseling_isabel_15_12,I'm glad we have the same taste.
d_counseling_isabel_15_13,I guess my dabbling in some interior decorating paid off!
d_counseling_isabel_15_14,I turned down Isabel's offer to live together.
d_counseling_isabel_16_1,"Honey,"
d_counseling_isabel_16_2,what do you look for in your significant other?
d_counseling_isabel_16_3,Why do you ask?
d_counseling_isabel_16_4,You check all the boxes.
d_counseling_isabel_16_5,Because... I've always wondered
d_counseling_isabel_16_6,what kind of people you like.
d_counseling_isabel_16_7,*Plop*
d_counseling_isabel_16_8,You're such a sweet talker!
d_counseling_isabel_16_9,I love hearing you say that.
d_counseling_isabel_16_10,Even if it may not be true.
d_counseling_isabel_16_11,"I spend some more time with Isabel, not sure whether to be happy or frightened."
d_counseling_isabel_17_1,"People say that if you truly love someone, you should let them go."
d_counseling_isabel_17_2,Do you agree with that sentiment?
d_counseling_isabel_17_3,I do.
d_counseling_isabel_17_4,I don't.
d_counseling_isabel_17_5,If you say so...
d_counseling_isabel_17_6,"Well, don't worry! Even if you wanted to let me go,"
d_counseling_isabel_17_7,I'm not going anywhere!
d_counseling_isabel_17_8,"Hehe, me too."
d_counseling_isabel_17_9,You're the only one for me!
d_counseling_isabel_17_10,I could never be happy with anybody else.
d_counseling_isabel_17_11,I have a conversation with Isabel about how to love someone.
d_counseling_isabel_18_1,"Honey, you're home!"
d_counseling_isabel_18_2,How was work?
d_counseling_isabel_18_3,"Honey, I'm home!"
d_counseling_isabel_18_4,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_isabel_18_5,It's just like we're husband and wife...
d_counseling_isabel_18_6,Am I dreaming?
d_counseling_isabel_18_7,Thank you for playing along!
d_counseling_isabel_18_8,Sigh... I'm sorry.
d_counseling_isabel_18_9,It's just that...
d_counseling_isabel_18_10,I wanted to feel like I was your wife.
d_counseling_isabel_18_11,"If it's not too much trouble, can you humor me next time?"
d_counseling_isabel_18_12,I listened to Isabel as she went on and on about newlyweds and how they interact.
d_counseling_isabel_19_1,Do you think there will be a day when there are no more Raptures on the surface?
d_counseling_isabel_19_2,"Well, about that..."
d_counseling_isabel_19_3,The day will surely come.
d_counseling_isabel_19_4,Oh... Sorry.
d_counseling_isabel_19_5,I didn't mean to be a downer.
d_counseling_isabel_19_6,"Don't worry, even if the Raptures never disappear,"
d_counseling_isabel_19_7,I will take you up to the surface one day. I promise.
d_counseling_isabel_19_8,"If it does, you won't have to be cooped up underground like you are now."
d_counseling_isabel_19_9,"Then, you and I can..."
d_counseling_isabel_19_10,Sigh... That day can't come soon enough.
d_counseling_isabel_19_11,I have a conversation with Isabel about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_isabel_20_1,What do you like doing during your spare time?
d_counseling_isabel_20_2,Sleeping.
d_counseling_isabel_20_3,Going for a walk.
d_counseling_isabel_20_4,Is that all?
d_counseling_isabel_20_5,"Actually, that sounds like a nice way to pass the time."
d_counseling_isabel_20_6,Perfect!
d_counseling_isabel_20_7,Walk...
d_counseling_isabel_20_8,Going for a walk inside the home...
d_counseling_isabel_20_9,"Hmm... For Honey's hobby, I will prepare something more."
d_counseling_isabel_20_10,"I spend some more time with Isabel, not sure whether to be happy or frightened."
d_counseling_julia_01_1,Neon has such an explosive personality.
d_counseling_julia_01_2,She told me she only likes music with a *bang*.
d_counseling_julia_01_3,I'm just not sure how to satisfy her desire.
d_counseling_julia_01_4,Fire a gun.
d_counseling_julia_01_5,"Sing a song like ""Firepower, O Firepower""."
d_counseling_julia_01_6,Fire a gun...?
d_counseling_julia_01_7,"Ah, I see! You mean I should imagine the flame shooting from the barrel of a gun,"
d_counseling_julia_01_8,and use that as my inspiration!
d_counseling_julia_01_9,"I knew you could help me, Conductor!"
d_counseling_julia_01_10,... I'm sorry.
d_counseling_julia_01_11,I don't think there's anyone out there who would want to hear me sing. My voice just isn't strong enough.
d_counseling_julia_01_12,I help Julia practice so that she can give a powerful performance for Neon.
d_counseling_julia_02_1,Fast music is like a raging wave.
d_counseling_julia_02_2,"Calm music, by contrast, is like a placid lake."
d_counseling_julia_02_3,Which type of music are you in the mood for today?
d_counseling_julia_02_4,Fast as a wave.
d_counseling_julia_02_5,Calm as a lake.
d_counseling_julia_02_6,I knew it.
d_counseling_julia_02_7,"I figured you would know how to ride the flow of the music, Conductor."
d_counseling_julia_02_8,That's why I knew you would want to hear something with a quick tempo.
d_counseling_julia_02_9,Really?
d_counseling_julia_02_10,"Judging by the way you walk, I'm surprised to hear you say that."
d_counseling_julia_02_11,I talk with Julia about music.
d_counseling_julia_03_1,Anis told me not to wander around aimlessly like a lost spirit.
d_counseling_julia_03_2,"But, I haven't been wandering around at all!"
d_counseling_julia_03_3,Could... could Anis have seen my soul wandering around without me knowing?
d_counseling_julia_03_4,She means you should make yourself known when walking about.
d_counseling_julia_03_5,I do think Anis has the power to see other people's souls.
d_counseling_julia_03_6,Really?!
d_counseling_julia_03_7,My footsteps already ring out above the gentle rustle of the breeze...
d_counseling_julia_03_8,"But next time, I'll try to walk a little louder."
d_counseling_julia_03_9,I never dreamed that Anis had such power!
d_counseling_julia_03_10,I've finally found something worth learning from her...
d_counseling_julia_03_11,other than how to squawk away in a high-pitched voice all day.
d_counseling_julia_03_12,I talk with Julia about Anis.
d_counseling_julia_04_1,"I want to perform for my mentor, Mustang."
d_counseling_julia_04_2,"However, I don't know what kind of music to prepare."
d_counseling_julia_04_3,Calming music that unveils the true essence of art itself.
d_counseling_julia_04_4,Buoyant and entertaining music that will liven up the room.
d_counseling_julia_04_5,Yes! My mentor takes art very seriously.
d_counseling_julia_04_6,But I'm not sure if music's tranquility is what excites him.
d_counseling_julia_04_7,Yes! The one thing my mentor constantly talks about...
d_counseling_julia_04_8,is entertainment!
d_counseling_julia_04_9,"In that case, I'll win him over with the passion of my playing."
d_counseling_julia_04_10,Thank you for your advice.
d_counseling_julia_04_11,I spend time with Julia talking about Mustang.
d_counseling_julia_05_1,"Conductor, whenever I see you, my heart starts beating faster."
d_counseling_julia_05_2,I feel as if I've experienced this before...
d_counseling_julia_05_3,But... where?
d_counseling_julia_05_4,Whenever you see tasty food?
d_counseling_julia_05_5,Whenever you get musical inspiration?
d_counseling_julia_05_6,??
d_counseling_julia_05_7,Why would food make my heart beat faster?
d_counseling_julia_05_8,Flavor is enjoyed with the tongue.
d_counseling_julia_05_9,The heart has nothing to do with it.
d_counseling_julia_05_10,Oh! Oh! That's it!
d_counseling_julia_05_11,"Whenever a wave of musical inspiration washes over my body, my heart starts pounding. Just like it is now."
d_counseling_julia_05_12,"Conductor, you are like music to me."
d_counseling_julia_05_13,I have a pleasant time talking with Julia.
d_counseling_julia_06_1,Conductor.
d_counseling_julia_06_2,"When it's raining, what kind of music do you like to listen to?"
d_counseling_julia_06_3,Tearjerkers that can make me cry like the clouds.
d_counseling_julia_06_4,"Bold, emotional music that washes over me like a downpour."
d_counseling_julia_06_5,Tears in the rain...
d_counseling_julia_06_6,A wonderful match!
d_counseling_julia_06_7,!!
d_counseling_julia_06_8,Music that washes over you like a downpour...
d_counseling_julia_06_9,I think I'm feeling a burst of inspiration.
d_counseling_julia_06_10,I spend time with Julia thinking about rainy days.
d_counseling_julia_07_1,Rapi is so good to me.
d_counseling_julia_07_2,She often takes care of me when I stay in the Outpost.
d_counseling_julia_07_3,I want to repay her somehow...
d_counseling_julia_07_4,What kind of music can best express my gratitude?
d_counseling_julia_07_5,What about something other than music? Something tangible that she can use.
d_counseling_julia_07_6,Something solemn that matches Rapi's style.
d_counseling_julia_07_7,Something tangible? But this violin is the only thing I own...
d_counseling_julia_07_8,!!
d_counseling_julia_07_9,"I'm sorry! I'm very grateful for what she's done, but I can't give her this violin."
d_counseling_julia_07_10,"Right. Solemn, but with a hint of warmth."
d_counseling_julia_07_11,That sort of music would be perfect for her.
d_counseling_julia_07_12,What a wonderful idea! I'll do exactly as you say.
d_counseling_julia_07_13,I talk with Julia about our memories of Rapi.
d_counseling_julia_08_1,"Sometimes, when I'm up on the surface,"
d_counseling_julia_08_2,I get so lonely. It's almost too much to take.
d_counseling_julia_08_3,"When I feel this way, what should I do?"
d_counseling_julia_08_4,Use your music to express yourself.
d_counseling_julia_08_5,Have a musical battle with the Raptures.
d_counseling_julia_08_6,"You're right... I abandoned the thing I love the most,"
d_counseling_julia_08_7,and then complain about how lonely I feel.
d_counseling_julia_08_8,You've given me a lot to think about.
d_counseling_julia_08_9,"Raptures can play music, too?!"
d_counseling_julia_08_10,"Even so, I must never use music for battle."
d_counseling_julia_08_11,My mentor taught me that music is not about competition.
d_counseling_julia_08_12,Julia and I talk about how to keep from being lonely up on the surface.
d_counseling_julia_09_1,Conductor.
d_counseling_julia_09_2,"When you think of your hometown, what kind of music comes to mind?"
d_counseling_julia_09_3,"Music that's full of nostalgia, with a tinge of warmth."
d_counseling_julia_09_4,Music that's cold and forlorn.
d_counseling_julia_09_5,Really?
d_counseling_julia_09_6,"No wonder you're such a warm person, Conductor."
d_counseling_julia_09_7,I'd like to visit your hometown someday.
d_counseling_julia_09_8,That's exactly how I feel.
d_counseling_julia_09_9,"Despite growing up in such a cold and desolate place, you're still such a kind person."
d_counseling_julia_09_10,"You really are amazing, Conductor."
d_counseling_julia_09_11,I spend time with Julia talking about our hometowns.
d_counseling_julia_10_1,Anis seems startled every time she sees me.
d_counseling_julia_10_2,She always makes me forget what kind of music I wanted to play.
d_counseling_julia_10_3,I wonder what it could have been?
d_counseling_julia_10_4,A marching song that instills bravery into even the most cowardly of soldiers.
d_counseling_julia_10_5,A melancholy requiem that comforts the soul.
d_counseling_julia_10_6,That's right!
d_counseling_julia_10_7,I wanted to make that scaredy-cat Anis a little braver.
d_counseling_julia_10_8,Now I remember. Thank you!
d_counseling_julia_10_9,No.
d_counseling_julia_10_10,That would only scare Anis even more.
d_counseling_julia_10_11,She's so easily frightened...
d_counseling_julia_10_12,I play music with Julia while we both think about Anis.
d_counseling_julia_11_1,Julia is performing as if deeply immersed in her music.
d_counseling_julia_11_2,Let her be.
d_counseling_julia_11_3,Announce your presence.
d_counseling_julia_11_4,I waited until Julia was done with her performance.
d_counseling_julia_11_5,!!
d_counseling_julia_11_6,Conductor? How long were you...
d_counseling_julia_11_7,That was an amazing performance.
d_counseling_julia_11_8,You waited until I was done with my performance!
d_counseling_julia_11_9,Thank you for doing that.
d_counseling_julia_11_10,!!
d_counseling_julia_11_11,"Sorry, I got too caught up in my playing."
d_counseling_julia_11_12,I'll try to be more aware of my surroundings from now on.
d_counseling_julia_11_13,I spend some time with Julia listening to her play.
d_counseling_julia_12_1,"Conductor, you don't look so good."
d_counseling_julia_12_2,"If you feel like something is weighing down on you, listening to some music might help."
d_counseling_julia_12_3,Should I play something soothing for you?
d_counseling_julia_12_4,"Actually, I'd prefer something more upbeat. I want to beat my fatigue into submission."
d_counseling_julia_12_5,You don't have to play anything.
d_counseling_julia_12_6,!!
d_counseling_julia_12_7,Beat one's fatigue into submission.
d_counseling_julia_12_8,What an interesting notion!
d_counseling_julia_12_9,I'll see what I can do.
d_counseling_julia_12_10,Are you sure?
d_counseling_julia_12_11,Sometimes spending some quiet time alone can be the key to clearing your head.
d_counseling_julia_12_12,"Rather than play anything, I'll just spend some quiet time together with you..."
d_counseling_julia_12_13,I spend time with Julia relaxing.
d_counseling_julia_13_1,"When you are resting, what kind of music do you listen to?"
d_counseling_julia_13_2,Music that gives me nice dreams.
d_counseling_julia_13_3,I don't listen to music.
d_counseling_julia_13_4,You mean to say that listening to music in real life
d_counseling_julia_13_5,can influence your own dreams?
d_counseling_julia_13_6,That's amazing!
d_counseling_julia_13_7,!!
d_counseling_julia_13_8,I had no idea you weren't a fan of music...
d_counseling_julia_13_9,I can't even imagine going through life like that.
d_counseling_julia_13_10,I try to pick out some music to listen to while hanging out with Julia.
d_counseling_julia_14_1,There are so many different holidays and days of remembrance.
d_counseling_julia_14_2,"If you could make today a holiday, what would you have it commemorate?"
d_counseling_julia_14_3,The moment where I stood and spoke with you about this very topic.
d_counseling_julia_14_4,The moment I heard you play your music.
d_counseling_julia_14_5,But then we'd have to talk about the same thing every year!
d_counseling_julia_14_6,"I like seeing you, but"
d_counseling_julia_14_7,that might get boring after a while...
d_counseling_julia_14_8,"So, that would mean"
d_counseling_julia_14_9,"on this same day every year, I would be able to play for you."
d_counseling_julia_14_10,That would be fantastic!
d_counseling_julia_14_11,Julia and I have a conversation about various holidays meant for commemoration.
d_counseling_julia_15_1,A lot of people say you should ride a motorcycle at least once before you die.
d_counseling_julia_15_2,But I really don't think I'm the motorcycle-riding type.
d_counseling_julia_15_3,Is there anything else I could try riding?
d_counseling_julia_15_4,You could ride the rhythm.
d_counseling_julia_15_5,You could ride your violin.
d_counseling_julia_15_6,"Hey, that's right!"
d_counseling_julia_15_7,"In a sense, I ""ride"" the rhythm everyday!"
d_counseling_julia_15_8,I can't believe I didn't think of that before.
d_counseling_julia_15_9,"Um... I'm sorry Conductor, but"
d_counseling_julia_15_10,I can't be so careless with my violin!
d_counseling_julia_15_11,It's much too precious to me.
d_counseling_julia_15_12,I'll have to figure out something else.
d_counseling_julia_15_13,Julia and I try to figure out other alternatives to a motorcycle.
d_counseling_julia_16_1,"Conductor, so much has happened since I met you."
d_counseling_julia_16_2,My life and my music have both changed.
d_counseling_julia_16_3,I wonder how much more they'll change in the future?
d_counseling_julia_16_4,"Whatever the change ends up being, I'm sure it will be wonderful."
d_counseling_julia_16_5,"No matter how much things change, you'll always be who you are."
d_counseling_julia_16_6,Thank you for saying such nice things.
d_counseling_julia_16_7,I too believe that any changes I experience will be for the better.
d_counseling_julia_16_8,!!
d_counseling_julia_16_9,"You're right. No matter how much I change, I'll never not be me."
d_counseling_julia_16_10,My love for music... and for you...
d_counseling_julia_16_11,will always be with me.
d_counseling_julia_16_12,Julia and I have a conversation about the passage of time and how things change.
d_counseling_julia_17_1,"Conductor, have you ever been to the Outer Rim?"
d_counseling_julia_17_2,I heard it's a sinister place filled with danger.
d_counseling_julia_17_3,Is that true?
d_counseling_julia_17_4,More dangerous that you can even imagine.
d_counseling_julia_17_5,It's a truly lonely and desolate place.
d_counseling_julia_17_6,So the rumors are true.
d_counseling_julia_17_7,"I was hoping there was another aspect to that place, so that I could get some musical inspiration from it."
d_counseling_julia_17_8,Bummer.
d_counseling_julia_17_9,Ahah... I see...!
d_counseling_julia_17_10,So there's a bit more to it then?
d_counseling_julia_17_11,"In that case, I'd love to go there someday for a little musical inspiration."
d_counseling_julia_17_12,Julia and I have a conversation about the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_julia_18_1,Someone once told me that there's not a single performance that could satisfy every audience in the world.
d_counseling_julia_18_2,"Sometimes, an audience just doesn't click with the performer."
d_counseling_julia_18_3,That got me thinking: Is there anyone that you just don't get along with?
d_counseling_julia_18_4,Not in particular.
d_counseling_julia_18_5,"Oh, sure. Plenty of people."
d_counseling_julia_18_6,"I knew I could count on you, Conductor."
d_counseling_julia_18_7,"To me, you're like a grand symphony. One that is all-encompassing,"
d_counseling_julia_18_8,comforting all those its notes reaches.
d_counseling_julia_18_9,So you're no exception...
d_counseling_julia_18_10,I thought you would be...
d_counseling_julia_18_11,I have a conversation with Julia about the relationship between an audience and the performer.
d_counseling_julia_19_1,I had a nightmare last night.
d_counseling_julia_19_2,I had lost my violin and was wandering lost up on the surface.
d_counseling_julia_19_3,It was just awful! I can't get it out of my mind.
d_counseling_julia_19_4,"But even in a nightmare, you never forgot how to play your music, right?"
d_counseling_julia_19_5,"It's okay, it's not like you've lost your violin in real life."
d_counseling_julia_19_6,!!
d_counseling_julia_19_7,"That's right! Even though I had lost my violin,"
d_counseling_julia_19_8,I never lost my ability to play music.
d_counseling_julia_19_9,"In a sense, that nightmare was actually a pathway for me to gain a new appreciation of music."
d_counseling_julia_19_10,"Thank you, Conductor. I'm not scared anymore."
d_counseling_julia_19_11,You're right about that.
d_counseling_julia_19_12,My violin is safe and sound in real life.
d_counseling_julia_19_13,...
d_counseling_julia_19_14,I'm sure I'll be fine. I just need some time.
d_counseling_julia_19_15,Thanks for your concern.
d_counseling_julia_19_16,Julia and I talked about nightmares.
d_counseling_julia_20_1,"If you were to discover a legendary yet unprecedented music score on the surface,"
d_counseling_julia_20_2,what would you do with it?
d_counseling_julia_20_3,I would have you perform it for me.
d_counseling_julia_20_4,I'd pawn it for some quick cash.
d_counseling_julia_20_5,You would trust me with such a precious composition?
d_counseling_julia_20_6,"You're too kind, Conductor!"
d_counseling_julia_20_7,!!
d_counseling_julia_20_8,Selling such a precious composition for money?!
d_counseling_julia_20_9,That's inconceivable to me!
d_counseling_julia_20_10,Julia and I talk more about what we would do with this legendary music score.
d_counseling_liter_01_1,Young Nikkes these days don't have any manners.
d_counseling_liter_01_2,"When I give them advice as their senior, they either just yawn or scratch their heads."
d_counseling_liter_01_3,"Hey, Greenhorn. Do you think my advice is useless, too?"
d_counseling_liter_01_4,Don't you remember what it's like to be young?
d_counseling_liter_01_5,Advice is the greatest gift that the old can give the young.
d_counseling_liter_01_6,...
d_counseling_liter_01_7,"I used to think old folks didn't know anything, either."
d_counseling_liter_01_8,Mmm... I see. I guess nothing's really changed.
d_counseling_liter_01_9,That's exactly what I'm talking about!
d_counseling_liter_01_10,"... But, seeing how much they hate it, that may indicate that something's wrong with me."
d_counseling_liter_01_11,I have a discussion with Liter about giving advice.
d_counseling_liter_02_1,"Greenhorn, imagine you had a dog."
d_counseling_liter_02_2,"Now, imagine that dog was doing its business in a place where people don't usually go."
d_counseling_liter_02_3,"Would you clean it up, or just leave it?"
d_counseling_liter_02_4,"It wouldn't be so bad to leave it, right? Just once?"
d_counseling_liter_02_5,I would still clean it up.
d_counseling_liter_02_6,You rapscallion!
d_counseling_liter_02_7,You don't deserve to be a dog owner!
d_counseling_liter_02_8,That's right! Of course you have to clean it up!
d_counseling_liter_02_9,You can't just leave it even if nobody's around. You're going to make all of us dog owners look bad!
d_counseling_liter_02_10,"Hey, you're a pretty good dog owner, Greenhorn!"
d_counseling_liter_02_11,... I don't have the heart to tell Liter I don't actually have a dog.
d_counseling_liter_03_1,Do you ever think about leashes?
d_counseling_liter_03_2,A lot of people think a leash restricts a dog's freedom.
d_counseling_liter_03_3,"But what do you think, Greenhorn?"
d_counseling_liter_03_4,"It's about their safety, not their freedom."
d_counseling_liter_03_5,Dogs deserve their freedom.
d_counseling_liter_03_6,...
d_counseling_liter_03_7,That's a great response.
d_counseling_liter_03_8,You never know when and where an accident will happen. We need to protect dogs.
d_counseling_liter_03_9,Hmmm... I see.
d_counseling_liter_03_10,"Well, what good is freedom if you don't have safety?"
d_counseling_liter_03_11,"You listen to me, youngster..."
d_counseling_liter_03_12,I listen to Liter about the benefits of the leash.
d_counseling_liter_04_1,There are times you have to be strict with people when giving instructions for work.
d_counseling_liter_04_2,"I've been thinking if I've been too harsh recently... Well, I mean sometimes."
d_counseling_liter_04_3,Should I change my ways?
d_counseling_liter_04_4,I think a change might do you good.
d_counseling_liter_04_5,Being strict is a matter of safety.
d_counseling_liter_04_6,Is that so.
d_counseling_liter_04_7,"But, I'm worried about everyone's safety."
d_counseling_liter_04_8,"If I'm not strict, they'll get complacent quickly..."
d_counseling_liter_04_9,Hmmm... That's right.
d_counseling_liter_04_10,"If I'm strict, they are more careful. That's the most important."
d_counseling_liter_04_11,I need to play the villain to make sure that everyone is safe.
d_counseling_liter_04_12,I listen to Liter lecture about lecturing.
d_counseling_liter_05_1,Centi is such an amazing kid.
d_counseling_liter_05_2,"She does everything I tell her, without any complaining."
d_counseling_liter_05_3,"But, I'm worried that she might become too dependent."
d_counseling_liter_05_4,Centi is not a kid.
d_counseling_liter_05_5,It's okay. She has you to watch out for her.
d_counseling_liter_05_6,"... Right. She probably has thoughts of her own, I suppose."
d_counseling_liter_05_7,"Soon, she will be independent enough to make it without me."
d_counseling_liter_05_8,"Haha. When I think about it, delight and sorrow mix in my heart..."
d_counseling_liter_05_9,Haha! That's the right answer.
d_counseling_liter_05_10,"... But, you know, even I will die one day."
d_counseling_liter_05_11,I can't always be by her side.
d_counseling_liter_05_12,I listen to Liter brag about Centi.
d_counseling_liter_06_1,I'm getting older and older.
d_counseling_liter_06_2,"Someday, I will no longer do this work."
d_counseling_liter_06_3,"But every time I think about life without work, I get frustrated."
d_counseling_liter_06_4,You should prepare for your retirement.
d_counseling_liter_06_5,"When that day comes, you'll find something else to do."
d_counseling_liter_06_6,Retirement... I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_liter_06_7,"But, you know..."
d_counseling_liter_06_8,"I don't know how meaningful life could be after being retired, if it can't be enjoyed."
d_counseling_liter_06_9,Do you truly think so?
d_counseling_liter_06_10,"Even when these old bones can't do this job anymore,"
d_counseling_liter_06_11,there's bound to be something else that I'll enjoy.
d_counseling_liter_06_12,I have a conversation with Liter about the future.
d_counseling_liter_07_1,"About Ludmilla, there are moments when she seems too mature."
d_counseling_liter_07_2,"As far as I know, she is much younger than me so I wonder why."
d_counseling_liter_07_3,... Could she be lying about her age?
d_counseling_liter_07_4,Maybe it's because of her high quality of life.
d_counseling_liter_07_5,... Maybe it's because you're less mature than you thought?
d_counseling_liter_07_6,Quality of life... I see.
d_counseling_liter_07_7,I guess it doesn't matter how long you have lived. What's important is the quality of life you've lived...
d_counseling_liter_07_8,"Hmm... I understand. Thank you, Greenhorn."
d_counseling_liter_07_9,...
d_counseling_liter_07_10,...
d_counseling_liter_07_11,"Frankly, I'm offended."
d_counseling_liter_07_12,I have a conversation with Liter about Ludmilla.
d_counseling_liter_08_1,Why is Anis like that?
d_counseling_liter_08_2,Why does she keep taking her socks off everywhere?!
d_counseling_liter_08_3,I can only clean up after her for so long!
d_counseling_liter_08_4,"From now on, if you see her socks lying around, just come and tell me."
d_counseling_liter_08_5,"It's a bit of a secret, but Anis actually has a medical condition with her feet..."
d_counseling_liter_08_6,... Greenhorn.
d_counseling_liter_08_7,I'm actually speechless that you just said that.
d_counseling_liter_08_8,... Ah. Is that so.
d_counseling_liter_08_9,"Hmmm... I didn't even know, and I..."
d_counseling_liter_08_10,...
d_counseling_liter_08_11,... You. You're lying.
d_counseling_liter_08_12,I listen to Liter gossip about Anis for a while.
d_counseling_liter_09_1,"Mmmm... I got a new task at work,"
d_counseling_liter_09_2,"but for some reason, I just can't seem to focus."
d_counseling_liter_09_3,Maybe I'm getting old... Or maybe I'm just tired...
d_counseling_liter_09_4,Maybe it's because you don't find the work interesting anymore?
d_counseling_liter_09_5,You just need a good rest.
d_counseling_liter_09_6,Oh. I think that might be it.
d_counseling_liter_09_7,"I had an inkling that might be it. After all, the work is similar to what I've done before."
d_counseling_liter_09_8,But I guess I'll just have to grin and bear it...
d_counseling_liter_09_9,"If I slack off, who could replace me?"
d_counseling_liter_09_10,There are dozens of people who are relying on me.
d_counseling_liter_09_11,"Thank you for your words, but I can't."
d_counseling_liter_09_12,I listen to Liter talk about the work that she enjoys.
d_counseling_liter_10_1,"When I look at Volt, I always think to myself..."
d_counseling_liter_10_2,What a great life to live.
d_counseling_liter_10_3,No one lives as comfortably as she does.
d_counseling_liter_10_4,I'm envious.
d_counseling_liter_10_5,Volt also has her own troubles.
d_counseling_liter_10_6,... Don't be jealous of a dog.
d_counseling_liter_10_7,What? This bastard? No way.
d_counseling_liter_10_8,Woof! Woof woof!
d_counseling_liter_10_9,Argh! What's gotten into you all of a sudden?!
d_counseling_liter_10_10,I spend a good time with Volt.
d_counseling_liter_11_1,I have a long-time customer. He's been coming to Mighty Tools for over 10 years.
d_counseling_liter_11_2,We're actually close enough that we've gone out to eat a couple of times.
d_counseling_liter_11_3,"However, I recently discovered he's been tampering with the construction funds."
d_counseling_liter_11_4,I'm at a loss. What do I do?
d_counseling_liter_11_5,Give him a piece of your mind.
d_counseling_liter_11_6,Let it slide so your relationship can remain intact.
d_counseling_liter_11_7,That's what I was thinking.
d_counseling_liter_11_8,But I keep psyching myself out and can't take the plunge. I was hoping someone could give me one last push.
d_counseling_liter_11_9,"And thanks to you, I got just that!"
d_counseling_liter_11_10,You're right. He and I have a good thing going with our friendship.
d_counseling_liter_11_11,"No matter what, I won't jeopardize that."
d_counseling_liter_11_12,"Gosh, living in this world sure isn't easy."
d_counseling_liter_11_13,Liter tells me more about this customer that was giving her trouble.
d_counseling_liter_12_1,I was thinking about picking up a new hobby.
d_counseling_liter_12_2,That board that Epinel rides looks like a lot of fun.
d_counseling_liter_12_3,I was thinking about giving it a try.
d_counseling_liter_12_4,"But, aren't I a bit too old for that sort of thing?"
d_counseling_liter_12_5,"If you injure yourself at your age, you'll have a harder time recovering."
d_counseling_liter_12_6,Age doesn't matter when it comes to hobbies.
d_counseling_liter_12_7,*Bark*
d_counseling_liter_12_8,Looks like Volt agrees with you. I guess you're right... It'd be bad news if I ended up hurting myself...
d_counseling_liter_12_9,...
d_counseling_liter_12_10,"Oh, screw the both of you!"
d_counseling_liter_12_11,You've got a point.
d_counseling_liter_12_12,"Come to think of it, Nikkes don't get any weaker when we age."
d_counseling_liter_12_13,"All right, it's settled. I'll give it a shot."
d_counseling_liter_12_14,I listened to Liter as she listed off all the reasons she wanted to give boarding a try.
d_counseling_liter_13_1,I was thinking of getting Volt a younger brother.
d_counseling_liter_13_2,"I'm not at home a lot, and Volt looks like he's feeling a little lonely."
d_counseling_liter_13_3,"If I get him a little brother to play with, he might not be as lonely."
d_counseling_liter_13_4,Then you'll just end up with two lonely dogs instead of one.
d_counseling_liter_13_5,How about bringing two more dogs?
d_counseling_liter_13_6,!!
d_counseling_liter_13_7,You could be right...
d_counseling_liter_13_8,What I should do instead is just bring Volt with me wherever I go.
d_counseling_liter_13_9,Two plus Volt... That'd be three dogs altogether.
d_counseling_liter_13_10,...
d_counseling_liter_13_11,"No, I can't take care of them like Biscuit."
d_counseling_liter_13_12,Liter shares a few more of her worries about Volt with me.
d_counseling_liter_14_1,"Thanks to advances in medical technology and there not being any risk of car accidents or natural disasters,"
d_counseling_liter_14_2,I've heard that the elderly population in the Ark is on the rise.
d_counseling_liter_14_3,"Apparently, there's been some friction between the younger populace and the elderly."
d_counseling_liter_14_4,"If you had to choose, who would you side with?"
d_counseling_liter_14_5,I don't want any part in it.
d_counseling_liter_14_6,I can't choose. I see both sides.
d_counseling_liter_14_7,You shouldn't ignore such important social issues!
d_counseling_liter_14_8,"You don't have to pick a side, but you should at least be following it!"
d_counseling_liter_14_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_liter_14_10,It's important to listen to both sides of the story but...
d_counseling_liter_14_11,"that could easily lead to indifference and you ignoring the issue, so be careful."
d_counseling_liter_14_12,Liter and I debate about social issues.
d_counseling_liter_15_1,"Time catches up to all of us eventually. Even you'll grow old someday, Greenhorn."
d_counseling_liter_15_2,"So, how old would you like to be?"
d_counseling_liter_15_3,I wanna become an old geezer.
d_counseling_liter_15_4,I'd like to live as a hot charming middle-aged guy.
d_counseling_liter_15_5,"Haha, what a sight that would be!"
d_counseling_liter_15_6,"Once you get old enough, you stop caring about what anyone else thinks."
d_counseling_liter_15_7,It might be fun to be able to do whatever you want.
d_counseling_liter_15_8,"Well, you'll have to do more than just wish for it to make it happen."
d_counseling_liter_15_9,You'd also need to have the looks for it.
d_counseling_liter_15_10,"However, for you Greenhorn, I can comfortably see that in your future."
d_counseling_liter_15_11,Liter and I look up various ways on how to stay young.
d_counseling_liter_16_1,"There aren't any restaurants near the construction site I'm working at right now, so I've been packing my lunch."
d_counseling_liter_16_2,"It wasn't so bad at first, but I'm starting to get a little tired of it."
d_counseling_liter_16_3,What can I do to change things up?
d_counseling_liter_16_4,I'll ask Emma if she can pack you a lunch.
d_counseling_liter_16_5,I'll pack your lunch.
d_counseling_liter_16_6,...
d_counseling_liter_16_7,...
d_counseling_liter_16_8,"... Um, no thanks. That's all right."
d_counseling_liter_16_9,You?
d_counseling_liter_16_10,Haha. That's very sweet of you.
d_counseling_liter_16_11,But I couldn't ask you to do that. I appreciate your offering though.
d_counseling_liter_16_12,Liter and I discuss what we think is the perfect packed lunch.
d_counseling_liter_17_1,Even I will die someday.
d_counseling_liter_17_2,"I know people say Nikkes are immortal, but nothing in this world lasts forever."
d_counseling_liter_17_3,I already know what kind of death I want.
d_counseling_liter_17_4,"What about you, Greenhorn? Is there any way you'd prefer to leave this world?"
d_counseling_liter_17_5,Surrounded by beautiful women.
d_counseling_liter_17_6,Dying peacefully in my sleep.
d_counseling_liter_17_7,...
d_counseling_liter_17_8,"Er... well, it's a free country, so if that's what you want..."
d_counseling_liter_17_9,"More power to you, I suppose."
d_counseling_liter_17_10,I see...
d_counseling_liter_17_11,A lot of people prefer that kind of death.
d_counseling_liter_17_12,"But for you, it just seems so...ordinary."
d_counseling_liter_17_13,Liter and I have a heavy conversation about death.
d_counseling_liter_18_1,You can tell a lot about a person by how they clean. I get a big kick out of it.
d_counseling_liter_18_2,"Rapi, to be honest, is kinda boring. She doesn't spill anything, and never makes a mess."
d_counseling_liter_18_3,"If I see gunpowder residue everywhere, I know Neon is the culprit."
d_counseling_liter_18_4,And for Anis...
d_counseling_liter_18_5,Soda cans lying everywhere?
d_counseling_liter_18_6,Socks all strewn about?
d_counseling_liter_18_7,Precisely. I think she has soda instead of blood pumping through her veins.
d_counseling_liter_18_8,She's always tossing the cans on the floor when she's done.
d_counseling_liter_18_9,"At least put them all in one spot! Everywhere I go, I'm stepping on cans!"
d_counseling_liter_18_10,"If I see one more can, I'm gonna lose it!"
d_counseling_liter_18_11,Yes! Why on earth does she take off her socks wherever she goes?
d_counseling_liter_18_12,"Just how many pairs of socks does she have, anyway?"
d_counseling_liter_18_13,You'd think she just wears them once and then buys another pair later.
d_counseling_liter_18_14,Wait... I think that may be actually what's happening! That's it! I'm gonna go talk to her!
d_counseling_liter_18_15,Liter and I look for Anis.
d_counseling_liter_19_1,"What are some of your favorite foods, Greenhorn?"
d_counseling_liter_19_2,"Me personally, I like..."
d_counseling_liter_19_3,"Wait, no."
d_counseling_liter_19_4,Try guessing what food I like.
d_counseling_liter_19_5,... Porridge?
d_counseling_liter_19_6,Dog treats?
d_counseling_liter_19_7,"C'mon, I'm not THAT old!"
d_counseling_liter_19_8,...
d_counseling_liter_19_9,But I do like eating porridge.
d_counseling_liter_19_10,*Bark*
d_counseling_liter_19_11,Quit making fun of me!
d_counseling_liter_19_12,"I don't like dog treats, okay?!"
d_counseling_liter_19_13,So stop looking at me like that!
d_counseling_liter_19_14,Liter and I talk about our favorite foods.
d_counseling_liter_20_1,I'm loving this new toolset that I got.
d_counseling_liter_20_2,Centi's eyes were practically green with envy.
d_counseling_liter_20_3,So I just...
d_counseling_liter_20_4,"You didn't poke her in the eye, did you?"
d_counseling_liter_20_5,Did you sell it for a premium?
d_counseling_liter_20_6,I couldn't help myself... wait.
d_counseling_liter_20_7,I would never do something like that.
d_counseling_liter_20_8,"I wouldn't say for a premium, but I did get a few Credits for it."
d_counseling_liter_20_9,"Although I am Centi's master, the closer the relationship, the clearer the account."
d_counseling_liter_20_10,"And after giving money, she will also treasure those tools more."
d_counseling_liter_20_11,Liter teaches me how to distinguish good tools from bad.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_1,I feel as if my luck has taken an unfortunate turn of late.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_2,My machines are abandoning me quicker than ever.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_3,Can nothing be done about this?
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_4,Let Alice do all the work for you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_5,Let me do the work for you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_6,She has already done enough service in my name.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_7,I dare not impose upon her anymore.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_8,You? With your own two hands?
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_9,This suggestion pleases me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_10,"Yet, are you not already sufficiently burdened with responsibilities?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_11,Worry not. I will face these troubles on my own.
d_counseling_ludmilla_01_12,I talk with Ludmilla about how she destroys everything she touches.
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_1,I have been thinking.
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_2,"This world is a cruel place. It is my wish that Alice will quickly come of age, so that she can get by on her own."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_3,"However, I fear that she may lose her innocence in the process."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_4,"Then again, as her guardian, perhaps I am just being selfish."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_5,"Even if she has to grow up, Alice will always be Alice."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_6,It's fine. All parents are like that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_7,Do you truly think so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_8,"Even when they come of age, people don't really change."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_9,Hearing that puts me at ease. I thank you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_10,"Somehow, I thought that I would be different."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_11,"I shouldn't worry so much. This all will pass in time, like everything else."
d_counseling_ludmilla_02_12,I spend time with Ludmilla while thinking about Alice.
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_1,"Every time you come here, you appear to be on the verge of becoming a popsicle."
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_2,Is there anything I could do to make you more comfortable?
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_3,Any chance you have a space heater?
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_4,Any chance I could get a hug from you?
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_5,A space heater? I assume it's a machine of some sort.
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_6,Very well. I shall procure one forthwith.
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_7,"However, I doubt its warmth could withstand my cold for long."
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_8,A-ha!
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_9,"So, it is my embrace that you desire?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_10,Very well.
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_11,"Come to me any time you are cold, and I will have a warm embrace waiting for you."
d_counseling_ludmilla_03_12,I talk with Ludmilla about how to withstand the frigid Northern temperatures.
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_1,Hm...
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_2,This tea tastes nothing like it used to.
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_3,"I prepared it in the usual way, and used the usual ingredients..."
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_4,Perhaps my taste buds are beginning to age?
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_5,Maybe it's the tea leaves that got old.
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_6,... Good luck with that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_7,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_8,"Now that I look at them, I believe you may be right."
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_9,It's been a while since I bought these tea leaves.
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_10,"Thanks to you, I have found the solution."
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_11,You rogue! You actually took my comment seriously?
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_12,I don't need your empty encouragement. I'm not that old yet!
d_counseling_ludmilla_04_13,I spend time having tea with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_1,"If I recall, you said that Liter is in your Outpost?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_2,I want to give her a present to celebrate the beginning of her new job there.
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_3,What should I get for her?
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_4,A doggie bone made of ice?
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_5,A hand-written letter?
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_6,What an innovative idea!
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_7,"Volt will love that, too!"
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_8,Marvelous suggestion. That's just what I'll get her.
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_9,Don't you think that's a bit... plain?
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_10,I want to do something truly special...
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_11,Hm. I require more time to think.
d_counseling_ludmilla_05_12,I talk with Ludmilla about Liter.
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_1,"Servant, several of the Nikkes were wondering..."
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_2,Do you have a type?
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_3,Someone who carries themselves like a Queen.
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_4,"Are you sure it's not just you that's curious, Ludmilla?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_5,Ha! I can see that you are teasing me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_6,I'm not so dense that I can't pick up on your not-so-subtle intimations.
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_7,"However, if you happen to be speaking the truth, know that I wouldn't mind."
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_8,Why in the world would I be so curious about such a trivial thing?
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_9,Why would I bother to spare a thought for your type?
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_10,After all...
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_11,You are nothing but my Servant.
d_counseling_ludmilla_06_12,I talk with Ludmilla about my type.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_1,Royal Road.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_2,Alice told me she heard about Royal Road today.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_3,It's been so long since I've heard someone mention that place. I do miss it.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_4,"Speaking of, have you ever been to Royal Road?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_5,I have.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_6,I haven't.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_7,Ha. I should have known.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_8,It is not unreasonable for you to have been there before.
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_9,"It is a pity, though. If you hadn't been there before, I could have made an excuse to take you there myself."
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_10,Oh? You've never been?
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_11,"In that case, why don't I take you there?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_12,"I'm a bit of a big deal in that area, so I'll have to wear a disguise."
d_counseling_ludmilla_07_13,I talk with Ludmilla about Royal Road.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_1,Servant.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_2,How would you define family?
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_3,Similar to the relationship between you and Alice.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_4,It's a relationship between those who are related by blood.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_5,Alice and I...
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_6,"we may not share the same blood,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_7,but I believe that we are connected on a deep level.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_8,Thank you for sharing your opinion with me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_9,"Yes, that is the normal definition of family."
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_10,"However, I think there's more to it than that."
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_11,Blood shouldn't be the only thing that defines a family. The heart also plays a role.
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_12,"At least, that's how I feel."
d_counseling_ludmilla_08_13,Ludmilla and I continue to ponder about family.
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_1,Andersen has something of a soft spot for you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_2,Did you already know this?
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_3,I'd rather have the affection of someone else.
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_4,"No, and I don't want to know."
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_5,"A-ha! Well, I know he is not your type."
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_6,"However, his affection does offer you more material benefits, right?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_7,So long as you don't despise him for feeling that way.
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_8,"Oh, my. You hate it to the point that you don't want to even know about it?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_9,I had no idea you despised Andersen with such fervor!
d_counseling_ludmilla_09_10,I spend time with Ludmilla talking about Andersen.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_1,"A few days ago, after I rescued a Nikke, she asked me:"
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_2,How can you live in such an unforgiving place?
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_3,What about you? Do you think living here is difficult?
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_4,It is a very inhospitable place.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_5,It has its own stark beauty.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_6,Do you truly think so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_7,I suppose I can sympathize.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_8,It is indeed not particularly suited for human habitation.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_9,Precisely!
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_10,I could not agree more.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_11,"It is a perilous place, with danger around every corner."
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_12,But therein lies its beauty! Or so I believe.
d_counseling_ludmilla_10_13,I spend some meaningful time with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_1,"You must have been to the Outer Rim, yes?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_2,What do you think of it?
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_3,It's a cesspool of crime and corruption.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_4,"It's far from heaven, that much is certain."
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_5,I didn't expect you to feel that way.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_6,I thought you would view it in a different light.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_7,I'll take note of that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_8,You and I are in agreement there.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_9,It's a society formed by splinter groups of those who have been abandoned.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_10,That's why it's such a dangerous and isolated place.
d_counseling_ludmilla_11_11,Ludmilla and I speak more about the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_1,Hmmm... I want to try a new tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_2,What should I try?
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_3,Some bitter tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_4,Some aromatic tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_5,You think so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_6,That's actually what I was leaning towards anyway.
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_7,"Very well then, prepare the tea Servant!"
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_8,You think so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_9,I think I'm more in the mood for bitter tea today...
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_10,"but what the heck, I'll go for some aromatic tea instead."
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_11,"Hurry and prepare the tea, Servant."
d_counseling_ludmilla_12_12,Ludmilla and I sip tea together while discussing the various types of tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_1,What splendid weather we're having.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_2,What do you usually do on days like today?
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_3,I like staying inside all day.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_4,It'd be nice to go out and have some tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_5,You're going to stay cooped up inside when the weather is this nice?
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_6,Absolutely not. Get up.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_7,Let's go outside and have some tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_8,You are an amazing servant indeed!
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_9,You're capable of reading the mind of whom you serve.
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_10,"Now then, let us go."
d_counseling_ludmilla_13_11,I go out on a picnic with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_1,"When you look at snow, what does it make you think of?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_2,You.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_3,Traumatic past events.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_4,Good answer.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_5,"If I'm the first thing you think over every time you lay eyes upon the North, or the snow,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_6,I will be very glad indeed.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_7,Understandable.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_8,Especially with how you nearly perished while buried under the snow.
d_counseling_ludmilla_14_9,Ludmilla and I talk more about snow.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_1,Safety amidst lies
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_2,and danger amidst reality...
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_3,Which would you choose?
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_4,Safety amidst lies.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_5,Danger amidst reality.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_6,It's no surprise someone from the Ark would think so.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_7,"For a person who knows the surface well, I thought you would have a different response."
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_8,I'm not sure if you really think so.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_9,But it would be better for you to remember that
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_10,falsehood always invites greater danger.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_11,I knew you would think so as you know the surface well.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_12,That's why you are probably getting lost all the time.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_13,But do not worry.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_14,"The closer you are to the truth, the more dangerous it gets. Yet, because of this risk you shoulder,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_15,the Nikkes are willing to lay their lives to protect you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_15_16,I spend some meaningful time with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_1,Did you know?
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_2,There aren't many Commander who take the time to consult with their Nikkes.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_3,Why are you going to so much trouble to listen to all of our concerns?
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_4,You're all my friends and squadmates. I want to know what's on your mind.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_5,I wonder what makes Nikkes tick.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_6,Good answer.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_7,Very good answer.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_8,I hope it's not just for the show.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_9,"When you put it that way,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_10,it sounds like you're just going through the motions of what needs doing.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_11,I suppose I can understand that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_16_12,Ludmilla and I talk more about why I'm so intent on listening to my Nikkes.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_1,Ludmilla is staring intently at her phone.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_2,I forgot to bring my gloves...
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_3,*Zzzhh* *Zhhh*
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_4,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_5,Hurl the phone far away from Ludmilla before it breaks.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_6,Snatch the phone and ask what she is trying to do.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_7,*Crash*
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_8,You made a wise decision. However...
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_9,... the phone is now destroyed.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_10,I think you may have gotten a little carried away.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_11,Can you use your phone to let Alice know we're in the middle of a discussion?
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_12,"Well done, Servant!"
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_13,Send Alice a message and let her know we're in the middle of a discussion.
d_counseling_ludmilla_17_14,I helped Ludmilla send Alice a message.
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_1,"Given my condition, do you think it would be better if I"
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_2,"called people, or sent them messages?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_3,Calling.
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_4,Messaging.
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_5,Oh? How so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_6,"If you use a speakerphone, you don't have to hold the phone for very long."
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_7,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_8,I thought you were going to say because you liked hearing my voice.
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_9,"However, you've put forth a very convincing argument just now!"
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_10,Hmm? How so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_11,"When you text someone, the conversation goes on longer than when you talk on the phone."
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_12,"I understand what you're saying, but I'm not sure what type of phone is out there that could"
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_13,"handle me holding it for that long...Either way, I'll keep that in mind."
d_counseling_ludmilla_18_14,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about using phones for extended periods of time.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_1,I know that you've been to many different places up on the surface.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_2,"Looking back, are there any locations that stand out?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_3,"For one, I remember the snowfields up north, where I met you."
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_4,Nothing much comes to mind.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_5,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_6,I'm delighted to hear you feel that way.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_7,I too have a special attachment to the place where we first met.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_8,"... Understandable. The surface is such a danger zone, I'm sure everything starts to blend together."
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_9,I hope one day you'll have been to some areas you feel are worth remembering.
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_10,"When that happens, the surface will no longer seem so threatening to you."
d_counseling_ludmilla_19_11,I go through all the previous places I'd been to on the surface with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_1,Andersen sent a new tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_2,Ludmilla hands over a teacup.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_3,Would you like to try it?
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_4,Not if it's from him.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_5,"Sure, why not."
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_6,Are you sure?
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_7,I'm sorry you feel that way.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_8,I was looking forward to drinking it together.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_9,"Well, what do you think?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_10,It must feel nice for your lips to be touching the cup where my lips have just been.
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_11,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_12,"Hehe, this is too fun!"
d_counseling_ludmilla_20_13,Ludmilla and I have a nice time together having tea.
d_counseling_maiden_01_1,I fully understand that I need to wear a mask to control my power but...
d_counseling_maiden_01_2,"But, sometimes, it's quite suffocating."
d_counseling_maiden_01_3,You can secretly take it off sometimes.
d_counseling_maiden_01_4,"Even so, it can be helpful at times."
d_counseling_maiden_01_5,I can't do... that.
d_counseling_maiden_01_6,"If my boss finds out I take it off, she'll get mad at me."
d_counseling_maiden_01_7,"I can see that you're disappointed, but there is nothing I can do. I'm sorry."
d_counseling_maiden_01_8,You're right. It's a contradiction.
d_counseling_maiden_01_9,"When I go on missions with Guillotine,"
d_counseling_maiden_01_10,It feels better hiding behind this mask.
d_counseling_maiden_01_11,I listen to Maiden's worries.
d_counseling_maiden_02_1,I... have a big problem.
d_counseling_maiden_02_2,"When a certain someone treats me nicely, even just a little bit, I get butterflies in my stomach."
d_counseling_maiden_02_3,I just don't know what to do with myself.
d_counseling_maiden_02_4,Give a pat on the shoulder as a sign of support.
d_counseling_maiden_02_5,You need to see them for who they really are.
d_counseling_maiden_02_6,*Thump*
d_counseling_maiden_02_7,See?! My heart skipped a beat!
d_counseling_maiden_02_8,"Do you mean if I got to know their quirks, then, perhaps I wouldn't like them anymore?"
d_counseling_maiden_02_9,"But, no matter how I look at it..."
d_counseling_maiden_02_10,"... I just can't see anything wrong with you, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_02_11,I listen to Maiden's concerns about falling in love.
d_counseling_maiden_03_1,Master of the Kotodama.
d_counseling_maiden_03_2,Judge of the blood-red rose.
d_counseling_maiden_03_3,These are some of the ridiculous nicknames given to me by Guillotine on SNS.
d_counseling_maiden_03_4,Can you tell Guillotine to stop it? I'm dying of embarrassment over here!
d_counseling_maiden_03_5,Have patience. This is a burden you must learn to bear.
d_counseling_maiden_03_6,I will talk to Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_03_7,Commander...
d_counseling_maiden_03_8,You and Guillotine are both so weird.
d_counseling_maiden_03_9,W-will you? Really?
d_counseling_maiden_03_10,Thank you! You don't know how depressed I was until now.
d_counseling_maiden_03_11,I listen to Maiden talk about her relationships.
d_counseling_maiden_04_1,"Sometimes, I hear Nikkes talk about Guillotine and me like we're urban legends or something."
d_counseling_maiden_04_2,"They say that if they become Irregulars, the Grim reaper will come and take them."
d_counseling_maiden_04_3,I don't know what to do with these rumors.
d_counseling_maiden_04_4,That is difficult.
d_counseling_maiden_04_5,Don't worry. Just be you.
d_counseling_maiden_04_6,Right? I don't think there is an answer to this problem.
d_counseling_maiden_04_7,"Still, I feel so much better after talking to you."
d_counseling_maiden_04_8,I always try my best to do that.
d_counseling_maiden_04_9,"... It's not that easy, though, no matter how hard I try."
d_counseling_maiden_04_10,I have a deep conversation with Maiden about her fate.
d_counseling_maiden_05_1,Look at my clothes!
d_counseling_maiden_05_2,What do you think? How do I look?
d_counseling_maiden_05_3,It looks heavy.
d_counseling_maiden_05_4,It suits you.
d_counseling_maiden_05_5,...
d_counseling_maiden_05_6,You saw right through me.
d_counseling_maiden_05_7,!!
d_counseling_maiden_05_8,... Th-thank you. I never thought I would hear a compliment.
d_counseling_maiden_05_9,I talk with Maiden about her look.
d_counseling_maiden_06_1,I wish I had a friend who I could share my thoughts with.
d_counseling_maiden_06_2,"Someone normal, you know? Not like Guillotine the weirdo."
d_counseling_maiden_06_3,I can introduce you to some other Nikkes if you like.
d_counseling_maiden_06_4,Am I not enough?
d_counseling_maiden_06_5,Mmmm... Thank you for the offer...
d_counseling_maiden_06_6,But I try to avoid making friends with Nikkes.
d_counseling_maiden_06_8,I might have to kill them with my own hands later on. You never know.
d_counseling_maiden_06_9,I don't think I'll be able to do that if they're my friends.
d_counseling_maiden_06_10,That's not true!
d_counseling_maiden_06_11,I think you're a dear friend. I don't really deserve you...
d_counseling_maiden_06_12,I spend some meaningful time with Maiden.
d_counseling_maiden_07_1,C-Commander.
d_counseling_maiden_07_2,Do you notice anything different about me today?
d_counseling_maiden_07_3,Hmmm... The rose in your hair seems fresher.
d_counseling_maiden_07_4,Something different?
d_counseling_maiden_07_5,Huh?
d_counseling_maiden_07_6,But this is... an artificial flower.
d_counseling_maiden_07_7,That's not it. It's...
d_counseling_maiden_07_8,"I stayed up late last night, and my eyebags have worsened."
d_counseling_maiden_07_9,I'm glad you didn't notice it.
d_counseling_maiden_07_10,"I have a short talk with Maiden who, I think, tested me a little."
d_counseling_maiden_08_1,"What do you think about the boss, Ingrid?"
d_counseling_maiden_08_2,"Well, even myself, I find her quite scary. But I just wanted to know what others think of her."
d_counseling_maiden_08_3,I'm also afraid of Ingrid.
d_counseling_maiden_08_4,She's kinder than you think.
d_counseling_maiden_08_5,R-right?
d_counseling_maiden_08_6,I feel somewhat reassured since I'm not the only one feeling this way.
d_counseling_maiden_08_7,... That may be true...
d_counseling_maiden_08_8,people can be both kind and scary at the same time.
d_counseling_maiden_08_9,I talk with Maiden about Ingrid.
d_counseling_maiden_09_1,"Commander, do you have some time to spare tomorrow?"
d_counseling_maiden_09_2,"I know you always have a hectic schedule, but..."
d_counseling_maiden_09_3,I have some commitments tomorrow.
d_counseling_maiden_09_4,I can take some time off in the evening.
d_counseling_maiden_09_5,Right. Of course.
d_counseling_maiden_09_6,"I guess that's the bitter reality, then."
d_counseling_maiden_09_7,R-really?
d_counseling_maiden_09_8,I didn't expect that.
d_counseling_maiden_09_9,Good thing I didn't give up.
d_counseling_maiden_09_10,I have a conversation with Maiden.
d_counseling_maiden_10_1,What do you do when you're uncomfortable with one of your squad members?
d_counseling_maiden_10_2,"No, wait, I should tell you the whole truth."
d_counseling_maiden_10_3,"Every time Guillotine uses her powers and shouts, ""Dragon of the Deep!"", I feel so embarrassed."
d_counseling_maiden_10_4,Just pretend you don't know her.
d_counseling_maiden_10_5,Yell something even darker and more cringy.
d_counseling_maiden_10_6,I already tried that...
d_counseling_maiden_10_7,"But since we're wearing the same uniform, it's obvious we're on the same team."
d_counseling_maiden_10_8,No one ever falls for it.
d_counseling_maiden_10_9,...
d_counseling_maiden_10_10,Y-you're not kidding?
d_counseling_maiden_10_11,I talk with Maiden about her squad members.
d_counseling_maiden_11_1,Sigh... I really want to lie down.
d_counseling_maiden_11_2,"After we're done here, can I chill in your room for a bit?"
d_counseling_maiden_11_3,Sure.
d_counseling_maiden_11_4,Ingrid asked me to send you back as soon as this is over.
d_counseling_maiden_11_5,!!
d_counseling_maiden_11_6,Thanks! I thought you were going to refuse me point-blank.
d_counseling_maiden_11_7,It'll be our little secret from the boss.
d_counseling_maiden_11_8,Sigh... I thought you'd stand up for me...
d_counseling_maiden_11_9,Oh well.
d_counseling_maiden_11_10,Maiden and I proceeded to have a lovely conversation.
d_counseling_maiden_12_1,"Commander, do you think I'm weird?"
d_counseling_maiden_12_2,"After all, I'm a Nikke who executes other Nikkes."
d_counseling_maiden_12_3,Sounds perfectly normal to me.
d_counseling_maiden_12_4,It is a bit out of the ordinary.
d_counseling_maiden_12_5,N-normal?
d_counseling_maiden_12_6,That's the first time I've ever heard someone say that...
d_counseling_maiden_12_7,"So in your eyes, I'm just like any other Nikke?"
d_counseling_maiden_12_8,... Thank you.
d_counseling_maiden_12_9,I'm glad you're not too weirded out by it.
d_counseling_maiden_12_10,"Most people go on about how unique my job is, but they all"
d_counseling_maiden_12_11,keep their distance in the end.
d_counseling_maiden_12_12,"But not you, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_12_13,Maiden and I have a meaningful discussion.
d_counseling_maiden_13_1,"Commander, what kind of music do you usually listen to?"
d_counseling_maiden_13_2,Pulse-pounding music that gets the blood pumping.
d_counseling_maiden_13_3,Slow and serene music.
d_counseling_maiden_13_4,Hmmm...
d_counseling_maiden_13_5,That's what Guillotine listens to as well.
d_counseling_maiden_13_6,It's perfect for using as an alarm.
d_counseling_maiden_13_7,Seems you and I have the same taste in music.
d_counseling_maiden_13_8,"Whenever I listen to quiet music, it helps me sleep better."
d_counseling_maiden_13_9,Do you like to listen to music before you go to bed?
d_counseling_maiden_13_10,"During our discussion, Maiden and I decided to put on some music."
d_counseling_maiden_14_1,What things of a person you would have a crush on?
d_counseling_maiden_14_2,"I mean like personality, appearance, etc."
d_counseling_maiden_14_3,The voice of a beautiful lady hidden under a face mask.
d_counseling_maiden_14_4,The sharp eyes hidden under an eye mask.
d_counseling_maiden_14_5,...!
d_counseling_maiden_14_6,M-mask and beautiful lady...
d_counseling_maiden_14_7,Are you talking about me?
d_counseling_maiden_14_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_maiden_14_9,It reminds me of someone.
d_counseling_maiden_14_10,... Should I also use an eye mask from now?
d_counseling_maiden_14_11,I have a debate with Maiden about the attraction of a person.
d_counseling_maiden_15_1,"Argh, I hate wearing a face mask! It's such a pain eating out with it."
d_counseling_maiden_15_2,There has to be a better solution...
d_counseling_maiden_15_3,"Take your mask off when there is no one around, then eat."
d_counseling_maiden_15_4,Don't eat out as often.
d_counseling_maiden_15_5,That's what I've been doing.
d_counseling_maiden_15_6,What else can I do?
d_counseling_maiden_15_7,Hmmm...
d_counseling_maiden_15_8,"I'll try, but it's so depressing."
d_counseling_maiden_15_9,"Because of this mask, I have to restrain myself from eating too much."
d_counseling_maiden_15_10,Maiden and I try to come up with a mask that would allow you to eat at the same time.
d_counseling_maiden_16_1,I think our squad is being given way too many assignments.
d_counseling_maiden_16_2,"If we're not on the surface fighting Raptures,"
d_counseling_maiden_16_3,we're in the Ark going up against Irregulars.
d_counseling_maiden_16_4,We never have a moment's respite.
d_counseling_maiden_16_5,Ask for a raise.
d_counseling_maiden_16_6,I'll make a request for you to be taken off this mission.
d_counseling_maiden_16_7,I think that's a good idea.
d_counseling_maiden_16_8,Maiden takes out her phone and is about to call Ingrid...
d_counseling_maiden_16_9,...
d_counseling_maiden_16_10,But the boss is really intimidating.
d_counseling_maiden_16_11,Umm... Can you call her for me?
d_counseling_maiden_16_12,I don't want that.
d_counseling_maiden_16_13,Then I won't have as many opportunities to run into you.
d_counseling_maiden_16_14,"All I'm asking for is something simple, like a 20% raise."
d_counseling_maiden_16_15,Maiden and I talk about the working conditions over at Extrinsic during our discussion.
d_counseling_maiden_17_1,I've been dying to get this limited edition handbag.
d_counseling_maiden_17_2,"They just released it,"
d_counseling_maiden_17_3,but I already spent too much money this month...what should I do?
d_counseling_maiden_17_4,Dip into next month's allowance.
d_counseling_maiden_17_5,Start working part-time jobs.
d_counseling_maiden_17_6,But...
d_counseling_maiden_17_7,There are more limited edition handbags I want next month...
d_counseling_maiden_17_8,That's an amazing idea!
d_counseling_maiden_17_9,I can work for you!
d_counseling_maiden_17_10,We can even discuss the terms of my employment during our discussions. I'm sure we'll be able to come to an agreement.
d_counseling_maiden_17_11,Maiden and I have a conversation about borrowing money.
d_counseling_maiden_18_1,"When it's just me by myself at night, I get lonely."
d_counseling_maiden_18_2,"Commander, what would you do in a situation like this?"
d_counseling_maiden_18_3,I would call my friends.
d_counseling_maiden_18_4,I would enjoy some alone time.
d_counseling_maiden_18_5,Is it okay to do that?
d_counseling_maiden_18_6,I always kept myself from doing that because I thought I'd be disturbing everyone else.
d_counseling_maiden_18_7,"But since you said it's okay, I'll go ahead and hit them up."
d_counseling_maiden_18_8,...
d_counseling_maiden_18_9,You sound just like Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_18_10,"Please, I'm begging you, don't turn into a second Guillotine."
d_counseling_maiden_18_11,Maiden and I have a conversation on how to get over loneliness.
d_counseling_maiden_19_1,Online games are so fun.
d_counseling_maiden_19_2,You feel like you belong. You can talk to all these people you might normally have a difficult time talking to in real life.
d_counseling_maiden_19_3,"But on the other hand, I feel all this pressure to try and change my schedule to accommodate them."
d_counseling_maiden_19_4,What am I supposed to do here?
d_counseling_maiden_19_5,Play a single-player game.
d_counseling_maiden_19_6,Arrange a gathering them after midnight.
d_counseling_maiden_19_7,Are you even listening to me?
d_counseling_maiden_19_8,I don't want to stop playing online games.
d_counseling_maiden_19_9,"Hey, that's right! Most people aren't working after midnight."
d_counseling_maiden_19_10,"I'll bring it up in the group chat and see what they think. Thanks, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_19_11,Maiden and I talk about the life of a gamer.
d_counseling_maiden_20_1,"All of the Extrinsic Squad's operations are classified, so I can't confide in anyone about anything."
d_counseling_maiden_20_2,People end up thinking I just sit around all day and horse around.
d_counseling_maiden_20_3,"It really upsets me, but what can I do?"
d_counseling_maiden_20_4,"Well, isn't there some truth to it?"
d_counseling_maiden_20_5,"I understand what you all do, and have nothing but respect for you."
d_counseling_maiden_20_6,Hey!
d_counseling_maiden_20_7,You're supposed to be looking after my mental wellbeing!
d_counseling_maiden_20_8,There's no harm in telling me a white lie every once in a while...
d_counseling_maiden_20_9,...
d_counseling_maiden_20_10,Maiden wiped away her tears.
d_counseling_maiden_20_11,You're the only person who understands my predicament.
d_counseling_maiden_20_12,Have I ever told you how much I love you?
d_counseling_maiden_20_13,Maiden shared more of her troubles with me during our discussion.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_1,Commander!
d_counseling_marian_p_01_2,"Neon keeps yelling out ""Firepower!"" every time she sees me."
d_counseling_marian_p_01_3,But my name is not firepower.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_4,Maybe she doesn't know my name?
d_counseling_marian_p_01_5,She's just a nut for firepower.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_6,She may not have memorized your name yet. You should repeat it to her more often.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_7,Is that so?
d_counseling_marian_p_01_8,"Then, she does know my name!"
d_counseling_marian_p_01_9,That's a relief.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_10,"But, I know Neon's name..."
d_counseling_marian_p_01_11,Fine.
d_counseling_marian_p_01_12,"When I see her, I'll keep repeating my own name."
d_counseling_marian_p_01_13,I talk with Marian about the correlation between Neon and firepower.
d_counseling_marian_p_02_1,"I was hungry, so I ate some food from the fridge."
d_counseling_marian_p_02_2,"Then, Anis got really mad at me!"
d_counseling_marian_p_02_3,"Apparently, what I ate belonged to her."
d_counseling_marian_p_02_4,So... does everything in the fridge belong to Anis?
d_counseling_marian_p_02_5,Yes.
d_counseling_marian_p_02_6,No.
d_counseling_marian_p_02_7,!!
d_counseling_marian_p_02_8,Wow! She must be so rich!
d_counseling_marian_p_02_9,"Now that I know, I'll be asking her for more freebies!"
d_counseling_marian_p_02_10,What is that?
d_counseling_marian_p_02_11,"But then, how can you tell what's hers and what isn't?"
d_counseling_marian_p_02_12,Should I just ask the food who it belongs to?
d_counseling_marian_p_02_13,I teach Marian how to discern which food items belong to Anis.
d_counseling_marian_p_03_1,"Every time I play around in the flour,"
d_counseling_marian_p_03_2,Rapi just sighs and turns away.
d_counseling_marian_p_03_3,Is she sick or something?
d_counseling_marian_p_03_4,Maybe her head hurts.
d_counseling_marian_p_03_5,The problem isn't her head. It's her heart.
d_counseling_marian_p_03_6,Really? That's a big problem!
d_counseling_marian_p_03_7,"We should get a bandage for her head, then!"
d_counseling_marian_p_03_8,Really?
d_counseling_marian_p_03_9,Can we... put a bandage on her heart?
d_counseling_marian_p_03_10,I don't know how to make her feel better.
d_counseling_marian_p_03_11,"Marian and I talk about Rapi, concerned for her."
d_counseling_marian_p_04_1,Commander. I will protect you.
d_counseling_marian_p_04_2,I won't fail you this time!
d_counseling_marian_p_04_3,"Huh? ... Why did I say ""this time""?"
d_counseling_marian_p_04_4,Did I... fail to protect you before?
d_counseling_marian_p_04_5,No. You've always protected me.
d_counseling_marian_p_04_6,"This time, I'll protect you."
d_counseling_marian_p_04_7,Commander?
d_counseling_marian_p_04_8,What's that sad look on your face?
d_counseling_marian_p_04_9,"Don't do that. You'll make me sad, too."
d_counseling_marian_p_04_10,What? No! I should be the one who protects you...
d_counseling_marian_p_04_11,Oh! That's it! We can protect each other.
d_counseling_marian_p_04_12,How about it? I think it'll work out great!
d_counseling_marian_p_04_13,"I talk with Marian, thinking about a time long since passed."
d_counseling_marian_p_05_1,Neon keeps teasing me because I like bandages.
d_counseling_marian_p_05_2,"She says if I like them so much, I should be a mummy."
d_counseling_marian_p_05_3,What should I say to her?
d_counseling_marian_p_05_4,Dress up as a mummy and scare her.
d_counseling_marian_p_05_5,Cover her in bandages.
d_counseling_marian_p_05_6,"No, thanks! Being a mummy sounds like a real hassle."
d_counseling_marian_p_05_7,"I don't want to scare her, either."
d_counseling_marian_p_05_8,Anis says getting scared is bad for your heart.
d_counseling_marian_p_05_9,Cover her in bandages...?
d_counseling_marian_p_05_10,Yeah! That way I'd have another friend who loves bandages!
d_counseling_marian_p_05_11,Nice!
d_counseling_marian_p_05_12,I spend some enjoyable time together with Marian thinking about Neon.
d_counseling_marian_p_06_1,"Commander, do you hurt anywhere?"
d_counseling_marian_p_06_2,My leg has been hurting since last night.
d_counseling_marian_p_06_3,Nope.
d_counseling_marian_p_06_4,Your leg hurts?
d_counseling_marian_p_06_5,"Oh, no! Oh, no!"
d_counseling_marian_p_06_6,"Here, let me put a bandage on it for you."
d_counseling_marian_p_06_7,You sure?
d_counseling_marian_p_06_8,Aww... I wanted to bandage you up...
d_counseling_marian_p_06_9,"But then again, I guess it's good that you're feeling all right..."
d_counseling_marian_p_06_10,Marian and I play with bandages together.
d_counseling_marian_p_07_1,It feels so good to live here in the Outpost!
d_counseling_marian_p_07_2,Your room is the best of all.
d_counseling_marian_p_07_3,"Rapi, Anis, Neon all live here... And you too, Commander!"
d_counseling_marian_p_07_4,"Commander, what's your favorite place to be?"
d_counseling_marian_p_07_5,In the Commander's Room along with you.
d_counseling_marian_p_07_6,Anywhere in the Outpost.
d_counseling_marian_p_07_7,"I like being there with you, too."
d_counseling_marian_p_07_8,It's better than being by myself!
d_counseling_marian_p_07_9,You like the entire Outpost?
d_counseling_marian_p_07_10,"You sure like a lot of places, Commander!"
d_counseling_marian_p_07_11,I talk about the Outpost with Marian.
d_counseling_marian_p_08_1,"Commander, which flavor do you prefer? Grape or apple?"
d_counseling_marian_p_08_2,Grape.
d_counseling_marian_p_08_3,Apple.
d_counseling_marian_p_08_4,!!
d_counseling_marian_p_08_5,Grape?
d_counseling_marian_p_08_6,"I wanted to eat the grape one...
But you can have it."
d_counseling_marian_p_08_7,"I like Commander more than I like grape Splendamin, anyway!"
d_counseling_marian_p_08_8,Really? You prefer apple?
d_counseling_marian_p_08_9,That's good.
d_counseling_marian_p_08_10,It's good because I want to eat the grape Splendamin myself!
d_counseling_marian_p_08_11,The apple Splendamin is all yours!
d_counseling_marian_p_08_12,I spend time sharing some Splendamin with Marian.
d_counseling_marian_p_09_1,"Commander, what type person do you like?"
d_counseling_marian_p_09_2,The person in front of me.
d_counseling_marian_p_09_3,That's a secret.
d_counseling_marian_p_09_4,In front of you? You mean me?
d_counseling_marian_p_09_5,"I like you too!
Because you are warm and kind!"
d_counseling_marian_p_09_6,You're the best!
d_counseling_marian_p_09_7,!!
d_counseling_marian_p_09_8,Why is it a secret?
d_counseling_marian_p_09_9,Is it something I shouldn't know?
d_counseling_marian_p_09_10,I talk with Marian about what type of people we are into.
d_counseling_marian_p_10_1,"Whenever I go up to the surface, I enjoy getting to see the bright blue sky."
d_counseling_marian_p_10_2,"What kind of sky do you like, Commander?"
d_counseling_marian_p_10_3,"A blue sky, or the night sky?"
d_counseling_marian_p_10_4,Blue.
d_counseling_marian_p_10_5,Night sky.
d_counseling_marian_p_10_6,Same here!
d_counseling_marian_p_10_7,I love to look at all the pretty clouds while the sun shines down on me.
d_counseling_marian_p_10_8,"The sunlight feels so warm. Just like you, Commander. That's why I like it."
d_counseling_marian_p_10_9,"I like the night sky too, when it's twinkling with stars."
d_counseling_marian_p_10_10,"But, I prefer a bright blue sky."
d_counseling_marian_p_10_11,Feeling the warmth of the sunlight on my skin always makes me think of you...
d_counseling_marian_p_10_12,I talk about the sky up on the surface with Marian.
d_counseling_marian_p_11_1,Anis wants to shower together later.
d_counseling_marian_p_11_2,Would you like to join us?
d_counseling_marian_p_11_3,Absolutely not.
d_counseling_marian_p_11_4,...
d_counseling_marian_p_11_5,!!
d_counseling_marian_p_11_6,How come?
d_counseling_marian_p_11_7,Is it because the shower stall is too small?
d_counseling_marian_p_11_8,"Commander, your face is beet red!"
d_counseling_marian_p_11_9,Are you sick?
d_counseling_marian_p_11_10,Do you need a bandage?
d_counseling_marian_p_11_11,"As we continued our discussion, I quickly changed the topic."
d_counseling_marian_p_12_1,"I'm afraid that won't be easy, Commander."
d_counseling_marian_p_12_2,"Commander, you should turn back."
d_counseling_marian_p_12_3,... Rapi?
d_counseling_marian_p_12_4,What are you doing?
d_counseling_marian_p_12_5,Correct!
d_counseling_marian_p_12_6,I've been practicing talking like Rapi.
d_counseling_marian_p_12_7,How did it sound? Was I close?
d_counseling_marian_p_12_8,I'm trying to talk like Rapi.
d_counseling_marian_p_12_9,How did it sound? Was I close?
d_counseling_marian_p_12_10,I help Marian try to imitate Rapi's tone of voice.
d_counseling_marian_p_13_1,"Commander, could I have that pen that you're using?"
d_counseling_marian_p_13_2,"Sure, I don't need it."
d_counseling_marian_p_13_3,I'll buy you a new one.
d_counseling_marian_p_13_4,Wow! Thanks!
d_counseling_marian_p_13_5,Neon says I might enjoy collecting.
d_counseling_marian_p_13_6,"I'm really fond of you, so I decided I'm going to collect things related to you!"
d_counseling_marian_p_13_7,I don't want a new one.
d_counseling_marian_p_13_8,It has to be a pen that you've used before...
d_counseling_marian_p_13_9,"Neon says I might enjoy collecting, so I've decided to collect things related to you!"
d_counseling_marian_p_13_10,I spend time with Marian listing off all the different items I've used.
d_counseling_marian_p_14_1,I had a really weird dream last night.
d_counseling_marian_p_14_2,"In the dream, you were pointing a gun at me."
d_counseling_marian_p_14_3,And you weren't scared?
d_counseling_marian_p_14_4,Then what happened?
d_counseling_marian_p_14_5,Of course not!
d_counseling_marian_p_14_6,"I know you'd never shoot me, not even in a dream."
d_counseling_marian_p_14_7,I can't remember the rest.
d_counseling_marian_p_14_8,But I was happy to see you in the dream!
d_counseling_marian_p_14_9,Hopefully I can see you in my dream tonight as well.
d_counseling_marian_p_14_10,Marian and I talk more while recollecting some of our past dreams.
d_counseling_marian_p_15_1,"I was reading a book today, and it said that mermaids live in the ocean."
d_counseling_marian_p_15_2,Have you ever seen a mermaid?
d_counseling_marian_p_15_3,No.
d_counseling_marian_p_15_4,Mermaids only exist in books.
d_counseling_marian_p_15_5,Maybe we'll be able to see one someday!
d_counseling_marian_p_15_6,"According to the book, they have a beautiful singing voice."
d_counseling_marian_p_15_7,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_marian_p_15_8,I really wanted to meet her. That's too bad.
d_counseling_marian_p_15_9,Then do you think we can meet Snow White?
d_counseling_marian_p_15_10,Marian and I have fun talking about different fairy tales.
d_counseling_marian_p_16_1,"Before I go to bed every night,"
d_counseling_marian_p_16_2,Rapi sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to me.
d_counseling_marian_p_16_3,Do you listen to any songs before you go to sleep?
d_counseling_marian_p_16_4,The same song.
d_counseling_marian_p_16_5,"Tears, Love, Break up, And Sleep."
d_counseling_marian_p_16_6,"Wow, what a coincidence!"
d_counseling_marian_p_16_7,I can barely get to the end of the song before I'm fast asleep.
d_counseling_marian_p_16_8,Twinkle twinkle little star...
d_counseling_marian_p_16_9,"Hmm, I've never heard of that one."
d_counseling_marian_p_16_10,I'll try and give it a listen one of these nights before I go to sleep!
d_counseling_marian_p_16_11,Marian and I talk about other music that puts you to sleep.
d_counseling_marian_p_17_1,"Commander, let's play rock paper scissors!"
d_counseling_marian_p_17_2,"You have to choose one, or you lose!"
d_counseling_marian_p_17_3,Rock...
d_counseling_marian_p_17_4,Paper...
d_counseling_marian_p_17_5,Scissor!
d_counseling_marian_p_17_6,Show scissors.
d_counseling_marian_p_17_7,Don't show anything.
d_counseling_marian_p_17_8,Shoot!
d_counseling_marian_p_17_9,I lost.
d_counseling_marian_p_17_10,"Congrats, Commander!"
d_counseling_marian_p_17_11,Umm...
d_counseling_marian_p_17_12,"Since you didn't do anything, does that mean I win?"
d_counseling_marian_p_17_13,That's not very exciting...
d_counseling_marian_p_17_14,Marian and I spend some time playing rock paper scissors.
d_counseling_marian_p_18_1,I really enjoy our discussions together.
d_counseling_marian_p_18_2,I'm happy to be talking with you right now!
d_counseling_marian_p_18_3,Me too.
d_counseling_marian_p_18_4,I'm glad that you are happy.
d_counseling_marian_p_18_5,That makes me even happier knowing that you feel that way!
d_counseling_marian_p_18_6,Today is just the best!
d_counseling_marian_p_18_7,I'm glad too!
d_counseling_marian_p_18_8,"How about you, Commander? Are you happy today?"
d_counseling_marian_p_18_9,I hope you're as happy as I am!
d_counseling_marian_p_18_10,Marian and I have a great time talking to each other.
d_counseling_marian_p_19_1,We all underwent some additional training a while ago.
d_counseling_marian_p_19_2,"Rapi came in first, but I was second!"
d_counseling_marian_p_19_3,Good job.
d_counseling_marian_p_19_4,Try and finish on top next time.
d_counseling_marian_p_19_5,Thanks!
d_counseling_marian_p_19_6,But next time I want to be first.
d_counseling_marian_p_19_7,"If I'm going to protect you, then I need to be stronger."
d_counseling_marian_p_19_8,I will!
d_counseling_marian_p_19_9,"If I'm going to protect you, then I need to be stronger."
d_counseling_marian_p_19_10,Marian and I talk about ways for her to get stronger.
d_counseling_marian_p_20_1,Did you know if you shake a can of carbonated water
d_counseling_marian_p_20_2,"and then open it, it gushes out like a fountain!"
d_counseling_marian_p_20_3,How do you know that?
d_counseling_marian_p_20_4,I can't say I do.
d_counseling_marian_p_20_5,"Neon said that Anis is a big fan of water fountains,"
d_counseling_marian_p_20_6,so I shook up all the carbonated water we have in the fridge.
d_counseling_marian_p_20_7,"When Anis opens them, it'll be like a fountain in her own home! She'll love it!"
d_counseling_marian_p_20_8,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_marian_p_20_9,Well... I just shook up all the carbonated water we have in the fridge.
d_counseling_marian_p_20_10,Why don't you go and try opening one up now?
d_counseling_marian_p_20_11,"As we ended our discussion, I started planning how to clean up the impending flood of carbonated water."
d_counseling_mary_01_1,"Commander, do you like your food sweet?"
d_counseling_mary_01_2,Or do you prefer it salty?
d_counseling_mary_01_3,Both.
d_counseling_mary_01_4,Neither.
d_counseling_mary_01_5,"Hey now, you should know how bad that is for your health!"
d_counseling_mary_01_6,"I guess I'll have to give you an extra thorough checkup, right now!"
d_counseling_mary_01_7,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_mary_01_8,I didn't realize you were so health-conscious.
d_counseling_mary_01_9,"If you had said you liked both, I was going to give you a checkup right here."
d_counseling_mary_01_10,Too bad...
d_counseling_mary_01_11,I learn more from Mary about the correlation between food and health.
d_counseling_mary_02_1,"Commander, would you rather be very ill for a short period of time..."
d_counseling_mary_02_2,... or be just a little sick for a long time?
d_counseling_mary_02_3,Option 1.
d_counseling_mary_02_4,Option 2.
d_counseling_mary_02_5,Just as I thought!
d_counseling_mary_02_6,I figured you would say that.
d_counseling_mary_02_7,"After all, you're always being so reckless on missions and getting yourself hurt."
d_counseling_mary_02_8,"The syringe I prepared for you is perfect, then. It'll hurt for a little bit, but then you'll be as good as new."
d_counseling_mary_02_9,"Oh, is that so?"
d_counseling_mary_02_10,"Hm... I'm not sure what to do, then. The syringe I prepared is the other way around."
d_counseling_mary_02_11,Oh well. There's no other way!
d_counseling_mary_02_12,I guess you'll just have to take it anyway...
d_counseling_mary_02_13,I persuade Mary into not giving me a shot.
d_counseling_mary_03_1,"Commander, do you always try to hold onto all of your memories?"
d_counseling_mary_03_2,Even the bad ones?
d_counseling_mary_03_3,Yes.
d_counseling_mary_03_4,No.
d_counseling_mary_03_5,You do?
d_counseling_mary_03_6,"For a Commander in this day and age,"
d_counseling_mary_03_7,it would be far better to have a poor memory.
d_counseling_mary_03_8,"If you ever have a bad memory that just won't go away,
come and find me. Okay?"
d_counseling_mary_03_9,I'm glad to hear that.
d_counseling_mary_03_10,It's probably ideal for a Commander to not linger on their memories too long.
d_counseling_mary_03_11,"Sometimes war can give us positive memories, but most of them are traumatic."
d_counseling_mary_03_12,I spend some meaningful time with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_04_1,Commander!
d_counseling_mary_04_2,I have a patient who doesn't take care of themselves.
d_counseling_mary_04_3,They even refuse to take the medicine I prescribe for them.
d_counseling_mary_04_4,What should I do?
d_counseling_mary_04_5,"Sorry. From now on, I'll do whatever you say."
d_counseling_mary_04_6,Give them a painful shot.
d_counseling_mary_04_7,"Ha ha! So, you knew the patient I was talking about is you."
d_counseling_mary_04_8,What a shame.
d_counseling_mary_04_9,"If you hadn't figured it out, I was going to give you a painful shot."
d_counseling_mary_04_10,Can I really?
d_counseling_mary_04_11,"Well then, dear patient, you better buckle up, because this one is gonna hurt!"
d_counseling_mary_04_12,Hey! Where are you going?!
d_counseling_mary_04_13,I spend time with Mary while fighting the instinct to run away.
d_counseling_mary_05_1,"Commander, what should I do?"
d_counseling_mary_05_2,"Every time I see Pepper, I just get so excited!"
d_counseling_mary_05_3,Let me guess. You've found something to tease her about.
d_counseling_mary_05_4,Does Pepper owe you money or something?
d_counseling_mary_05_5,I knew you'd catch on quick!
d_counseling_mary_05_6,Pepper is so adorable. She made a little mistake in the hospital.
d_counseling_mary_05_7,I've been going to the hospital the past few days to tease her about it.
d_counseling_mary_05_8,"No, although I wouldn't mind a little extra spending money."
d_counseling_mary_05_9,"It's just that, every time I see her, all I want to do is tease her!"
d_counseling_mary_05_10,I speak with Mary about her opinion of Pepper.
d_counseling_mary_06_1,Pepper keeps asking what she needs to do to be like me.
d_counseling_mary_06_2,How should I respond to that?
d_counseling_mary_06_3,Tell her to be more of a buzzkill.
d_counseling_mary_06_4,Tell her to keep her eyes half-closed all the time.
d_counseling_mary_06_5,"Ha! Ha! Oh, Commander!"
d_counseling_mary_06_6,Do you really think I'm a buzzkill?
d_counseling_mary_06_7,You're such a silly goose!
d_counseling_mary_06_8,Good idea!
d_counseling_mary_06_9,"I'll make sure she does it, too."
d_counseling_mary_06_10,I have a fun time with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_07_1,"Hm... While I was walking through the Outpost,"
d_counseling_mary_07_2,"I saw lots of people who should come to the hospital, but they haven't."
d_counseling_mary_07_3,Why are they all avoiding coming to the hospital?
d_counseling_mary_07_4,They're scared of you.
d_counseling_mary_07_5,They're scared of the hospital.
d_counseling_mary_07_6,Am I really that bad?
d_counseling_mary_07_7,"Ha ha, I'm afraid I don't have the slightest idea what you mean, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_07_8,Hee hee hee hee...
d_counseling_mary_07_9,Hm. The hospital is typically somewhere you only go when you're sick.
d_counseling_mary_07_10,That can be scary for some people.
d_counseling_mary_07_11,Maybe that's why so many people avoid going.
d_counseling_mary_07_12,I spend some time with Mary sharing scary hospital stories.
d_counseling_mary_08_1,"I'm always used to having to listen to others talk, so I really enjoy it when I can talk to you."
d_counseling_mary_08_2,It puts my mind at ease and my worries all just melt away.
d_counseling_mary_08_3,"But, Commander... don't you ever want other people to listen to what's on your mind?"
d_counseling_mary_08_4,I do.
d_counseling_mary_08_5,I don't.
d_counseling_mary_08_6,How about you tell me what's on your mind next time?
d_counseling_mary_08_7,Maybe that way I can find a way to help you relax.
d_counseling_mary_08_8,Come to me any time you want to talk. Really.
d_counseling_mary_08_9,That's a normal reaction.
d_counseling_mary_08_10,"Well, if you ever want to talk about anything that's bothering you,"
d_counseling_mary_08_11,"just come find me.
I'll always make myself available for you."
d_counseling_mary_08_12,The time I spent with Mary was very meaningful.
d_counseling_mary_09_1,"You know, Commander..."
d_counseling_mary_09_2,Pepper really thinks I'm a good person.
d_counseling_mary_09_3,I feel bad about that.
d_counseling_mary_09_4,I'm not a good person. Not really.
d_counseling_mary_09_5,That's for Pepper to decide.
d_counseling_mary_09_6,"In my eyes, you're good enough."
d_counseling_mary_09_7,That's true.
d_counseling_mary_09_8,I suppose it is her right to make her own decision about me.
d_counseling_mary_09_9,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_09_10,"Commander, the way you look at me... it makes me feel... nice."
d_counseling_mary_09_11,"Thank you, hee hee."
d_counseling_mary_09_12,I have a heart-to-heart talk with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_10_1,"Hm, a thought just came to me."
d_counseling_mary_10_2,"If I wasn't a doctor, what would I be doing instead?"
d_counseling_mary_10_3,Jabbing people with needles for free?
d_counseling_mary_10_4,A nurse?
d_counseling_mary_10_5,"Ha ha! Is that what you think of me, Commander?"
d_counseling_mary_10_6,I'm afraid that's incorrect.
d_counseling_mary_10_7,I wouldn't want to be doing a job that only inflicts pain on others.
d_counseling_mary_10_8,"If not a doctor, then a nurse!"
d_counseling_mary_10_9,"So you think no matter what happens, I'll always be there with a syringe in my hand, is that it?"
d_counseling_mary_10_10,I... I suppose that's true.
d_counseling_mary_10_11,"No matter what, I'd almost certainly end up in the medical field."
d_counseling_mary_10_12,"A job where I inflict pain, yes, but also where I help others at the same time."
d_counseling_mary_10_13,There's only one field that fits this description.
d_counseling_mary_10_14,I have a fun time thinking about other jobs Mary would do.
d_counseling_mary_11_1,"I've been thinking about redecorating the rooms for our long-term patients, giving them some pizzazz."
d_counseling_mary_11_2,"If you have any good ideas, feel free to share."
d_counseling_mary_11_3,How about we place some flowers?
d_counseling_mary_11_4,Let's put in a video game system.
d_counseling_mary_11_5,Hmm...the only thing is that it's very difficult to find any fresh flowers in the Ark.
d_counseling_mary_11_6,"But if you're able to bring some back from up on the surface, then"
d_counseling_mary_11_7,"I think the patients would be very happy. I'd appreciate it as well, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_11_8,Are you sure that's not just what you want?
d_counseling_mary_11_9,"On top of that, not every patient is in the condition to be gaming."
d_counseling_mary_11_10,Mary and I brainstormed about ways to decorate the hospital rooms.
d_counseling_mary_12_1,What do you think is the most sought-after trait for a doctor?
d_counseling_mary_12_2,"Feeling compassion for their patients, or distancing themselves from the patients?"
d_counseling_mary_12_3,Compassion for the patients.
d_counseling_mary_12_4,Distancing themselves from the patients.
d_counseling_mary_12_5,I expected you would say that.
d_counseling_mary_12_6,However...
d_counseling_mary_12_7,"If you empathize too deeply with your patients,"
d_counseling_mary_12_8,"it could be traumatic, and you'll end up becoming an empty shell."
d_counseling_mary_12_9,This isn't only a problem for doctors.
d_counseling_mary_12_10,Oh my! I thought you would say the opposite.
d_counseling_mary_12_11,I'm surprised that you responded rationally. Hehe.
d_counseling_mary_12_12,"In that case, it would be wise to maintain a certain mental distance from the Nikkes whom you are counseling. Understood?"
d_counseling_mary_12_13,"As it turned out, I was the one who received counseling from Mary."
d_counseling_mary_13_1,We've been having a lot of patients who have been exaggerating their symptoms.
d_counseling_mary_13_2,"Hooting and hollering about being scared of shots, even crying."
d_counseling_mary_13_3,How on earth am I supposed to administer a shot to these people?
d_counseling_mary_13_4,Flash them a big smile.
d_counseling_mary_13_5,"Distract them by talking about something else, then give them a stealthy jab."
d_counseling_mary_13_6,I'm not sure about that.
d_counseling_mary_13_7,Seeing a nurse with a syringe in her hand and a deranged smile on her face
d_counseling_mary_13_8,will only freak outpatients more.
d_counseling_mary_13_9,That's a wonderful idea!
d_counseling_mary_13_10,Searching for the right moment to sneak it in sounds like fun too.
d_counseling_mary_13_11,Heehee.
d_counseling_mary_13_12,Mary and I talk about the proper mindset to have before administering a shot.
d_counseling_mary_14_1,We're preparing a small event for our patients at the hospital.
d_counseling_mary_14_2,"I can't decide between a concert by the Tetra Nikkes, or having the medical staff do some cosplay."
d_counseling_mary_14_3,What do you think the patients would get a bigger kick out of?
d_counseling_mary_14_4,Cosplay.
d_counseling_mary_14_5,Concert.
d_counseling_mary_14_6,"Hehe, good choice! Actually, I'm a big fan of cosplay."
d_counseling_mary_14_7,"Besides, Pepper is already practically a celebrity amongst the patients,"
d_counseling_mary_14_8,so there's no need to bring in famous Nikkes from outside.
d_counseling_mary_14_9,I'm sure the younger patients would appreciate that more.
d_counseling_mary_14_10,They all have pictures of either Epinel or Noise.
d_counseling_mary_14_11,Mary and I talk about the event to be held at the hospital.
d_counseling_mary_15_1,A new season has already arrived. Time goes by so fast.
d_counseling_mary_15_2,"By the way, are you sure you're not forgetting something?"
d_counseling_mary_15_3,I don't think so...
d_counseling_mary_15_4,A checkup?
d_counseling_mary_15_5,Strange...
d_counseling_mary_15_6,I'm positive I sent everyone a reminder to get a checkup done.
d_counseling_mary_15_7,Yet you're the only one who apparently isn't aware of it!
d_counseling_mary_15_8,"Hehe, bingo!"
d_counseling_mary_15_9,I can't emphasize enough just how important it is to get checks ups done regularly.
d_counseling_mary_15_10,"With that being said, I'll pencil you in."
d_counseling_mary_15_11,Mary continued to lecture me about the importance of getting regular checkups.
d_counseling_mary_16_1,We've had a lot of disputes and disagreements amongst the patients.
d_counseling_mary_16_2,"And the reasons are varied, such as because the manufacture is different, or the relationship was not good when they were human..."
d_counseling_mary_16_3,Anything I can do to help?
d_counseling_mary_16_4,Even when you're around?
d_counseling_mary_16_5,"Oh, don't worry! You're doing plenty already."
d_counseling_mary_16_6,"You're listening to me vent, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_16_7,"Hehe, of course not!"
d_counseling_mary_16_8,"If they pulled that when I was around,"
d_counseling_mary_16_9,I would make it more painful when giving them their shots.
d_counseling_mary_16_10,Mary shared the difficulties of hospital life with me.
d_counseling_mary_17_1,"Commander, how do you feel about white lies?"
d_counseling_mary_17_2,I think they can be a good thing.
d_counseling_mary_17_3,I'm completely against it.
d_counseling_mary_17_4,I agree completely.
d_counseling_mary_17_5,Telling the truth isn't always the best course of action.
d_counseling_mary_17_6,Especially if the truth could be hurtful to the person hearing it.
d_counseling_mary_17_7,"Yes, I figured that's how you'd feel."
d_counseling_mary_17_8,"However, some people may just blurt out a painful truth"
d_counseling_mary_17_9,"simply because they're looking to be forgiven, and that's all."
d_counseling_mary_17_10,Mary and I have a meaningful conversation.
d_counseling_mary_18_1,I recently had a Nikke patient ask me
d_counseling_mary_18_2,why I still work as a doctor when I'm a Nikke.
d_counseling_mary_18_3,And? Why do you think that is?
d_counseling_mary_18_4,This is your calling. You don't owe anyone an explanation.
d_counseling_mary_18_5,Atonement.
d_counseling_mary_18_6,"That sounds a bit pretentious, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_mary_18_7,"In the past, I wanted to help people in any way I could, and I still do now."
d_counseling_mary_18_8,...
d_counseling_mary_18_9,You hit the nail on the head.
d_counseling_mary_18_10,I'll be sure to tell that to the next person who asks me the same question.
d_counseling_mary_18_11,I speak with Mary about the mindset necessary to be a doctor.
d_counseling_mary_19_1,We've recently had an influx of patients with peculiar symptoms.
d_counseling_mary_19_2,They all ate the same food and ended up collapsing.
d_counseling_mary_19_3,What kind of food was it?
d_counseling_mary_19_4,Do you have any suspects?
d_counseling_mary_19_5,"I can't really be sure what it is, but"
d_counseling_mary_19_6,I believe ingredients were used that shouldn't be mixed together.
d_counseling_mary_19_7,"They also apparently burnt it to a crisp...honestly, you couldn't make a nastier dish if you tried."
d_counseling_mary_19_8,I do have my eye on one Nikke in particular.
d_counseling_mary_19_9,"She rarely comes to the hospital,"
d_counseling_mary_19_10,so we didn't have any opportunities to teach her about proper cooking methods.
d_counseling_mary_19_11,Mary vented about the culinary catastrophe.
d_counseling_mary_20_1,Medical staff always have to put on a happy face when they're in front of patients.
d_counseling_mary_20_2,But I'm not sure I agree with that.
d_counseling_mary_20_3,Who's to say how someone should act in front of others?
d_counseling_mary_20_4,"On that note, what traits do you look for in a person, Commander?"
d_counseling_mary_20_5,Selflessness
d_counseling_mary_20_6,Being down-to-earth.
d_counseling_mary_20_7,So... someone who thinks about others more than themselves?
d_counseling_mary_20_8,I suppose a lot of people find that admirable.
d_counseling_mary_20_9,"Wow, your standards are a bit different compared to other people."
d_counseling_mary_20_10,"Nevertheless, I appreciate your honesty."
d_counseling_mary_20_11,I'll try and be more true to myself when treating you as well.
d_counseling_mary_20_12,Mary and I talk about what makes an ideal medical professional.
d_counseling_maxwell_01_1,"Hey, Cutey!"
d_counseling_maxwell_01_2,Which do you like better: hot or cold?
d_counseling_maxwell_01_3,Cold?
d_counseling_maxwell_01_4,"If you are going to do an experiment, tell me in advance. I hate both."
d_counseling_maxwell_01_5,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_maxwell_01_6,Okay. If you feel so strongly about it...
d_counseling_maxwell_01_7,I'll take you to a cold chamber and see how you do!
d_counseling_maxwell_01_8,Ha! That's just like you!
d_counseling_maxwell_01_9,You catch on fast!
d_counseling_maxwell_01_10,That's what I like about you!
d_counseling_maxwell_01_11,I have a conversation with Maxwell while doing various tests.
d_counseling_maxwell_02_1,My Cutey has been lookin' mighty fine lately.
d_counseling_maxwell_02_2,"What do you think, Cutey? Is My Cutey missing anything?"
d_counseling_maxwell_02_3,"Nothing at all, it's perfect."
d_counseling_maxwell_02_4,It doesn't have any charm to it.
d_counseling_maxwell_02_5,Are you just saying that to make me feel better?
d_counseling_maxwell_02_6,I want you to tell me what you really think...
d_counseling_maxwell_02_7,"Well, thanks for the compliment anyway."
d_counseling_maxwell_02_8,!!
d_counseling_maxwell_02_9,Yes. You're right.
d_counseling_maxwell_02_10,"If you step back and take it all in, it's clearly lacking a sense of charm."
d_counseling_maxwell_02_11,I'm glad I asked you! Thanks!
d_counseling_maxwell_02_12,I chat with Maxwell while doing various tests.
d_counseling_maxwell_03_1,There's a Nikke up in the North who destroys everything she touches.
d_counseling_maxwell_03_2,She's been damaging my poor little My Cuteys.
d_counseling_maxwell_03_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_maxwell_03_4,You can't lose. You've got to find some way to best this Nikke.
d_counseling_maxwell_03_5,"If you want to cure a disease, you've got to eliminate the cause."
d_counseling_maxwell_03_6,You're right! I can't lose!
d_counseling_maxwell_03_7,I'll find a way to stop this Nikke from doing any more damage.
d_counseling_maxwell_03_8,"And you're going to help me, aren't you?"
d_counseling_maxwell_03_9,Eliminate the cause?
d_counseling_maxwell_03_10,"Sounds effective, but it doesn't seem very scientific..."
d_counseling_maxwell_03_11,"Besides, Nikkes can't fight against other Nikkes."
d_counseling_maxwell_03_12,"Oh, I get it! You must have been making a joke! Very funny."
d_counseling_maxwell_03_13,I chat with Maxwell while doing various tests.
d_counseling_maxwell_04_1,I feel like Laplace's hero complex is worse than ever.
d_counseling_maxwell_04_2,Do you think it has something to do with you?
d_counseling_maxwell_04_3,I think so.
d_counseling_maxwell_04_4,I don't think so.
d_counseling_maxwell_04_5,"So it does have something to do with you, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_maxwell_04_6,I assume you did something to encourage her?
d_counseling_maxwell_04_7,"Fine. Do whatever you want, so long as you realize this is all your fault."
d_counseling_maxwell_04_8,Hee hee! You sure about that?
d_counseling_maxwell_04_9,I heard you met with Laplace yesterday.
d_counseling_maxwell_04_10,"Well, okay."
d_counseling_maxwell_04_11,"You're adorable when you're clueless, Cutey."
d_counseling_maxwell_04_12,I have a conversation with Maxwell about Laplace.
d_counseling_maxwell_05_1,Agh! I can't take this!
d_counseling_maxwell_05_2,Drake's really been stressing me out lately.
d_counseling_maxwell_05_3,Why in the world is she always in such a rush?
d_counseling_maxwell_05_4,"How do you put up with her, Cutey?"
d_counseling_maxwell_05_5,I don't. She drives me up the wall as well.
d_counseling_maxwell_05_6,"She admits her faults, so I'm willing to cut her some slack."
d_counseling_maxwell_05_7,Really?
d_counseling_maxwell_05_8,I thought for sure you would be able to handle it.
d_counseling_maxwell_05_9,Didn't see this coming at all!
d_counseling_maxwell_05_10,I guess you're right.
d_counseling_maxwell_05_11,"If that wasn't the case, she and I would have butted heads sooner."
d_counseling_maxwell_05_12,*Sigh*
d_counseling_maxwell_05_13,"Either way, I'm glad you have a way of dealing with it."
d_counseling_maxwell_05_14,I have a conversation with Maxwell about Drake.
d_counseling_maxwell_06_1,"Cutey, who do you think would win in a fight?"
d_counseling_maxwell_06_2,Matis or Absolute?
d_counseling_maxwell_06_3,Matis.
d_counseling_maxwell_06_4,Absolute.
d_counseling_maxwell_06_5,Really?
d_counseling_maxwell_06_6,"You're just trying to butter me up, aren't you?"
d_counseling_maxwell_06_7,You know how much I love flattery.
d_counseling_maxwell_06_8,"Makes me happy to hear you say it, Cutey."
d_counseling_maxwell_06_9,Are you serious?
d_counseling_maxwell_06_10,"You'd say that, even when it's a member of Matis asking the question?"
d_counseling_maxwell_06_11,Are you sure?
d_counseling_maxwell_06_12,"All right, then. In order to defeat the oh-so-amazing Absolute,"
d_counseling_maxwell_06_13,you'll have to help me do some more testing on the My Cuteys.
d_counseling_maxwell_06_14,Right?
d_counseling_maxwell_06_15,I have a conversation with Maxwell while doing various tests.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_1,Do you like hot or cold food better?
d_counseling_maxwell_07_2,"If this is some kind of test, then neither."
d_counseling_maxwell_07_3,I'll eat whatever you give me.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_4,Huh? This isn't a test at all.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_5,Have a little more trust in me! Hee hee.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_6,"Aw, you're always so polite."
d_counseling_maxwell_07_7,"We may end up spending a lot of time together in the future, you know?"
d_counseling_maxwell_07_8,"Going on assignments, doing tests..."
d_counseling_maxwell_07_9,That's why I'm trying to learn what you like beforehand.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_10,I'll keep that in mind.
d_counseling_maxwell_07_11,I spend some meaningful time with Maxwell.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_1,Laplace says we are all heroes.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_2,"But in my opinion, Drake is more of the villain type."
d_counseling_maxwell_08_3,"As for me, I'm more like a researcher."
d_counseling_maxwell_08_4,"What do you think, Cutey? Would I be a researcher working for the villains, or for the heroes?"
d_counseling_maxwell_08_5,You'd be working for the villains.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_6,You'd be working for the heroes.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_7,Oh? Do I give off a villainous vibe?
d_counseling_maxwell_08_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_maxwell_08_9,You're not completely off the mark.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_10,I'm surprised to hear you say that. You think of me like a hero?
d_counseling_maxwell_08_11,"I'm... Well, I'm not sure if that makes me happy or sad."
d_counseling_maxwell_08_12,"Either way, Laplace is our leader, so we all have to act like heroes for the time being."
d_counseling_maxwell_08_13,We'll say you're correct... for now.
d_counseling_maxwell_08_14,I have a conversation with Maxwell about heroism.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_1,"Hey Cutey, do you have any unusual sleeping habits?"
d_counseling_maxwell_09_2,"Tossing, turning..."
d_counseling_maxwell_09_3,"hitting the walls and floor, that kind of thing?"
d_counseling_maxwell_09_4,Yes.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_5,No.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_6,Really? Is that so...
d_counseling_maxwell_09_7,"In that case, if I ever need to put you on anesthetics,"
d_counseling_maxwell_09_8,I'll just have to use a stronger dose.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_9,No? Glad to hear it.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_10,"If I ever need to put you on anesthetics,"
d_counseling_maxwell_09_11,I won't need to waste too much on you.
d_counseling_maxwell_09_12,"As I spend time with Maxwell, shivers run down my spine."
d_counseling_maxwell_10_1,"Cutey, who would you say is more difficult to deal with?"
d_counseling_maxwell_10_2,"Mustang, or Syuen?"
d_counseling_maxwell_10_3,Syuen.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_4,Mustang.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_5,Ha ha! You hate Syuen that much?
d_counseling_maxwell_10_6,I guess I can see it.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_7,"Mustang seems easygoing on the outside,"
d_counseling_maxwell_10_8,but that's the kind of person you really have to watch out for.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_9,"So, even though you're not a huge fan of Syuen, you don't find her overly difficult?"
d_counseling_maxwell_10_10,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_11,I think Syuen is much better than Mustang.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_12,"Syuen may have the occasional mean streak,"
d_counseling_maxwell_10_13,but at least it's the kind of mean that I can understand.
d_counseling_maxwell_10_14,I have a conversation with Maxwell about the CEOs of the Big Three.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_1,"If there was a button in front of you that would destroy the world,"
d_counseling_maxwell_11_2,would you press it?
d_counseling_maxwell_11_3,Yes.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_4,No.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_5,Really?
d_counseling_maxwell_11_6,Apparently you don't have any strong attachment to this world.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_7,I still have a lot that I want to research.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_8,No surprise there!
d_counseling_maxwell_11_9,"After all, you have a grand vision of changing this world yourself."
d_counseling_maxwell_11_10,"If this world was to end tomorrow, I'd be devastated."
d_counseling_maxwell_11_11,There's so much I still want to accomplish.
d_counseling_maxwell_11_12,Maxell and I talk about the end of the world.
d_counseling_maxwell_12_1,"Hey Cutey, do you have a moment?"
d_counseling_maxwell_12_2,"For you, all the time in the world."
d_counseling_maxwell_12_3,"Sorry, can't spare a single second."
d_counseling_maxwell_12_4,Perfect!
d_counseling_maxwell_12_5,Let's go out to lunch.
d_counseling_maxwell_12_6,"Haha, you thought I was going to ask you to help me with an experiment, didn't you?"
d_counseling_maxwell_12_7,"Even then, you still said that you had time for me. You're the best!"
d_counseling_maxwell_12_8,Really? That's too bad.
d_counseling_maxwell_12_9,I was going to ask if you wanted to get lunch.
d_counseling_maxwell_12_10,"You probably thought I was going to ask you to help me with an experiment, didn't you?"
d_counseling_maxwell_12_11,Maxwell and I hash out what we're going to have for lunch.
d_counseling_maxwell_13_1,"Cutey, if something important came up and you couldn't get a hold of the other person, what would you do?"
d_counseling_maxwell_13_2,I would just keep trying until I could get in touch with them.
d_counseling_maxwell_13_3,I would go find them.
d_counseling_maxwell_13_4,Even if you're not sure when you'll be able to reach them?
d_counseling_maxwell_13_5,You're more patient than me!
d_counseling_maxwell_13_6,"I could never do that, I'd run out of patience almost straight away."
d_counseling_maxwell_13_7,That could work...
d_counseling_maxwell_13_8,"Once you found them, you could talk face-to-face."
d_counseling_maxwell_13_9,And you wouldn't have to wait.
d_counseling_maxwell_13_10,Maxwell and I had a fun time talking to each other.
d_counseling_maxwell_14_1,If we succeed in reclaiming the surface
d_counseling_maxwell_14_2,"and rid the world of all Raptures,"
d_counseling_maxwell_14_3,what do you think will happen to all the Nikkes?
d_counseling_maxwell_14_4,We'll all live a peaceful coexistence on the surface.
d_counseling_maxwell_14_5,... I guess you'll all be scrapped.
d_counseling_maxwell_14_6,That'd be great!
d_counseling_maxwell_14_7,"That way you and I can continue our research, just like we are now."
d_counseling_maxwell_14_8,I like the sound of that!
d_counseling_maxwell_14_9,I doubt it would go that far.
d_counseling_maxwell_14_10,"But, even if we're not scrapped, do you think they try and keep us hidden away?"
d_counseling_maxwell_14_11,"We'd be considered remnants of a violent past, obsolete weapons of war that are no longer necessary."
d_counseling_maxwell_14_12,Maxwell and I speculate about potential futures.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_1,I think I've been too focused on my research lately.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_2,My thoughts are all in a jumble.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_3,What do you do to clear your head?
d_counseling_maxwell_15_4,Space out.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_5,Do something that I enjoy.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_6,Eh...
d_counseling_maxwell_15_7,"When I space out, my thinking only gets more erratic."
d_counseling_maxwell_15_8,That sounds like a good idea.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_9,"All right, it's settled then."
d_counseling_maxwell_15_10,Come to the power plant later.
d_counseling_maxwell_15_11,I spend time helping Maxwell organize her thoughts.
d_counseling_maxwell_16_1,Why does Laplace insist on leaping through the window when there's a perfectly good door nearby?
d_counseling_maxwell_16_2,We could have constructed an entire building with all the money spent repairing broken windows.
d_counseling_maxwell_16_3,It's what heroes do apparently.
d_counseling_maxwell_16_4,It's a bad habit she needs to fix.
d_counseling_maxwell_16_5,"Yeah, I guess just walking through the door isn't exactly a grand entrance."
d_counseling_maxwell_16_6,Were you thinking that I'd say something like that?
d_counseling_maxwell_16_7,"It's because you always spoil her, so she does it so incessantly."
d_counseling_maxwell_16_8,"It's fine to humor her, but don't go overboard."
d_counseling_maxwell_16_9,"Oh, I thought you were gonna let it slide. I totally didn't see that coming."
d_counseling_maxwell_16_10,"That's great! If you keep letting her get away with it, who's going to foot the bill?"
d_counseling_maxwell_16_11,How can we get her to stop leaping through windows...
d_counseling_maxwell_16_12,I spend time with Maxwell fretting about all the windows Laplace has shattered.
d_counseling_maxwell_17_1,I had a dream last night where I had achieved a historic breakthrough in my research.
d_counseling_maxwell_17_2,But the details are fuzzy.
d_counseling_maxwell_17_3,Does it really matter if you can't remember?
d_counseling_maxwell_17_4,Try your best to remember.
d_counseling_maxwell_17_5,Good point.
d_counseling_maxwell_17_6,"It's only a dream, so I shouldn't waste time obsessing over it."
d_counseling_maxwell_17_7,"Heck, it might be better that I can't remember it. That way I can get it out of my mind faster."
d_counseling_maxwell_17_8,"Our minds are in sync today, Cutey!"
d_counseling_maxwell_17_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_maxwell_17_10,"Nope, I'm drawing a blank."
d_counseling_maxwell_17_11,"Well, it was only a dream, so there's no point in obsessing over it. I'll succeed in real life."
d_counseling_maxwell_17_12,"Speaking of which, you and I can run some tests later."
d_counseling_maxwell_17_13,I have a conversation with Maxwell about research.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_1,Nothing in the world can beat Missilis technology!
d_counseling_maxwell_18_2,Wouldn't you say?
d_counseling_maxwell_18_3,I think you're being arrogant.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_4,I admire your confidence.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_5,"... I suppose you're right. They haven't even been able to exterminate the Raptures, and here I am saying they're the best in the world."
d_counseling_maxwell_18_6,"All right then, best in the Ark."
d_counseling_maxwell_18_7,"If you ask me though, it's not arrogance, but confidence."
d_counseling_maxwell_18_8,"After all, how can you expect to unveil the secrets of our world without being ambitious?"
d_counseling_maxwell_18_9,"Actually, that came off a little pompous as well, haha."
d_counseling_maxwell_18_10,Do you really think that?
d_counseling_maxwell_18_11,You really know how to make people feel good about themselves.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_12,You're a real social butterfly as well.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_13,I think that's a type of confidence as well.
d_counseling_maxwell_18_14,"Also, if you want to get discover more of the truths behind our world, you need unbridled ambition!"
d_counseling_maxwell_18_15,I have a conversation with Maxwell about Missilis technology.
d_counseling_maxwell_19_1,"Hey, Cutey! Look outside."
d_counseling_maxwell_19_2,"Today's perfect for running some tests, don't you think?"
d_counseling_maxwell_19_3,...Sure.
d_counseling_maxwell_19_4,No.
d_counseling_maxwell_19_5,"You say that, but your face says otherwise! Haha!"
d_counseling_maxwell_19_6,"I'm just kidding. Besides, it's time for us to have a talk with each other."
d_counseling_maxwell_19_7,Let's talk a bit more.
d_counseling_maxwell_19_8,"Wow, so adamant! Truly an immovable object."
d_counseling_maxwell_19_9,Harsh!
d_counseling_maxwell_19_10,"Just kidding! Anyway, let's keep talking."
d_counseling_maxwell_19_11,Maxwell and I have a nice casual chat.
d_counseling_maxwell_20_1,Have you ever thought about the future?
d_counseling_maxwell_20_2,What do you imagine life will be like then?
d_counseling_maxwell_20_3,"Probably still fighting with the Raptures, what else?"
d_counseling_maxwell_20_4,Hopefully we'll have reclaimed the surface.
d_counseling_maxwell_20_5,I didn't think you'd have such a bleak outlook on the future.
d_counseling_maxwell_20_6,"However, I have to say I feel the same way."
d_counseling_maxwell_20_7,"We know so little about the Raptures, it would be foolish to entertain the idea of reclaiming the surface."
d_counseling_maxwell_20_8,"With things as they are now, we'd need a miracle for that to happen."
d_counseling_maxwell_20_9,"And unless it can be scientifically proven, I'm not one to believe in miracles."
d_counseling_maxwell_20_10,So you dream of a hopeful future?
d_counseling_maxwell_20_11,"I can't say the same for myself,"
d_counseling_maxwell_20_12,"but if that's what you think, then that's what you think."
d_counseling_maxwell_20_13,Maxwell and I discuss the future.
d_counseling_mica_01_1,Old-Timer!
d_counseling_mica_01_2,Belorta keeps teasing me.
d_counseling_mica_01_3,What can I do to make her stop?
d_counseling_mica_01_4,You should tease her back.
d_counseling_mica_01_5,Have her come tease me instead.
d_counseling_mica_01_6,"Me, tease Belorta?"
d_counseling_mica_01_7,I've never thought about it...
d_counseling_mica_01_8,But I'll give it a try!
d_counseling_mica_01_9,!!
d_counseling_mica_01_10,I couldn't do that!
d_counseling_mica_01_11,You're a good person! I don't want you to suffer.
d_counseling_mica_01_12,I make plans with Mica to deal with Belorta's teasing.
d_counseling_mica_02_1,"Old-Timer! Belorta says that if you want to help others,"
d_counseling_mica_02_2,first you should figure out what you can get in return.
d_counseling_mica_02_3,"I help Belorta out all the time,"
d_counseling_mica_02_4,"so, what should I get in return?"
d_counseling_mica_02_5,Something good to eat.
d_counseling_mica_02_6,"A ""No Teasing for a Day"" voucher."
d_counseling_mica_02_7,I don't think that would work.
d_counseling_mica_02_8,Belorta loves eating too much.
d_counseling_mica_02_9,She wouldn't give up a single crumb.
d_counseling_mica_02_10,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_mica_02_11,"Every time I help Belorta, I'll ask her for that!"
d_counseling_mica_02_12,I have a conversation with Mica about how to stop being a pushover.
d_counseling_mica_03_1,Hey... Old-Timer...
d_counseling_mica_03_2,Um... Between me and Belorta...
d_counseling_mica_03_3,who do you like more?
d_counseling_mica_03_4,You.
d_counseling_mica_03_5,I don't have a favorite.
d_counseling_mica_03_6,Really?
d_counseling_mica_03_7,Haha. Hearing you say that makes me feel happy.
d_counseling_mica_03_8,"But, wait, Belorta was the one who told me to ask you."
d_counseling_mica_03_9,"If I tell her what you said... I'll probably get in trouble, won't I?"
d_counseling_mica_03_10,Huh? That's not what I thought you'd say...
d_counseling_mica_03_11,"Anyway, I only asked you because Belorta told me to. What should I tell her?"
d_counseling_mica_03_12,Mica and I try and figure out a way not to get in trouble with Belorta.
d_counseling_mica_04_1,"A few days ago,"
d_counseling_mica_04_2,I gave some of my food to this really hungry stray dog.
d_counseling_mica_04_3,"Then a cat came over, so I shared some of my food with it as well."
d_counseling_mica_04_4,Eventually... I had nothing left for myself.
d_counseling_mica_04_5,Belorta got really mad when she found out.
d_counseling_mica_04_6,Why do you think she was so upset?
d_counseling_mica_04_7,Because there was nothing left for you to eat.
d_counseling_mica_04_8,Because there was nothing left for her to eat.
d_counseling_mica_04_9,??
d_counseling_mica_04_10,That can't be it! Belorta always steals my food!
d_counseling_mica_04_11,"Yeah, that's gotta be it!"
d_counseling_mica_04_12,"I forgot about that. Gee, Old-Timer, you're so smart!"
d_counseling_mica_04_13,I have a conversation with Mica about Belorta's eating habits.
d_counseling_mica_05_1,Old-Timer! Old-Timer!
d_counseling_mica_05_2,"I heard that if you really want to be an adult, you've got to work on self-development."
d_counseling_mica_05_3,"So... if you don't, then you can't become an adult, right?"
d_counseling_mica_05_4,Exactly.
d_counseling_mica_05_5,That's not how it works.
d_counseling_mica_05_6,Ha ha! Great.
d_counseling_mica_05_7,I never want to become an adult!
d_counseling_mica_05_8,Self-development? Hah! I'll do my best to stay away from it.
d_counseling_mica_05_9,No?
d_counseling_mica_05_10,"So, even if I don't do it, I'll still become an adult anyway?"
d_counseling_mica_05_11,"Aw, man! That stinks."
d_counseling_mica_05_12,I try to come up with ways for Mica not to become an adult.
d_counseling_mica_06_1,"So, I was watching TV,"
d_counseling_mica_06_2,"and they said that if you're smart, you won't get fooled by pranks so easily."
d_counseling_mica_06_3,"So, starting today, I'm gonna be smart!"
d_counseling_mica_06_4,"If I'm smart, no one will be able to prank me! Right?"
d_counseling_mica_06_5,You're probably right.
d_counseling_mica_06_6,Is that really true?
d_counseling_mica_06_7,Ha ha! Fantastic!
d_counseling_mica_06_8,"If you think it'll work out, then I'm sure it will."
d_counseling_mica_06_9,Oh... Don't say that!
d_counseling_mica_06_10,"Getting pranked, even if I'm smart..."
d_counseling_mica_06_11,I'm getting anxious just thinking about it!
d_counseling_mica_06_12,I discuss ways to become smarter with Mica.
d_counseling_mica_07_1,"Old-Timer, what do you do when you're sad?"
d_counseling_mica_07_2,I cry like a little baby.
d_counseling_mica_07_3,I shove it down deep inside.
d_counseling_mica_07_4,Whoa! You're just like me!
d_counseling_mica_07_5,I just let the tears flow.
d_counseling_mica_07_6,"Then, Belorta holds my hand and tells me everything is gonna be okay."
d_counseling_mica_07_7,Hmm... you're more like Belorta.
d_counseling_mica_07_8,That's no way to deal with sadness!
d_counseling_mica_07_9,"If you don't say anything, no one will hold your hand and tell you everything is gonna be okay."
d_counseling_mica_07_10,I have a conversation with Mica about expressing sadness.
d_counseling_mica_08_1,"Old-Timer, I'm curious about something."
d_counseling_mica_08_2,What's the one thing you are most scared of?
d_counseling_mica_08_3,Did Belorta put you up to this?
d_counseling_mica_08_4,Belorta.
d_counseling_mica_08_5,How did you know?
d_counseling_mica_08_6,She sure did.
d_counseling_mica_08_7,"I have no idea why, though."
d_counseling_mica_08_8,!!
d_counseling_mica_08_9,"Wow! So, even Old-Timer feels that way about her?"
d_counseling_mica_08_10,"I really like Belorta, but she can be really scary sometimes."
d_counseling_mica_08_11,I chat with Mica about the scariest things in the world.
d_counseling_mica_09_1,"Neon yells out ""Firepower!"" whenever she sees me."
d_counseling_mica_09_2,What should I yell back at her?
d_counseling_mica_09_3,Firepower!
d_counseling_mica_09_4,Firecracker!
d_counseling_mica_09_5,The same thing she says?
d_counseling_mica_09_6,Isn't there anything else I can say?
d_counseling_mica_09_7,That's a good one!
d_counseling_mica_09_8,"From now on, I'll yell ""Firecracker!"" back at her."
d_counseling_mica_09_9,I have a conversation with Mica about Neon.
d_counseling_mica_10_1,I'm worried because no one comes to our toy shop.
d_counseling_mica_10_2,Do you think nobody likes toys anymore?
d_counseling_mica_10_3,Maybe they're just afraid of getting pranked.
d_counseling_mica_10_4,I don't think people are into toys.
d_counseling_mica_10_5,Ah! So that's why no one's coming!
d_counseling_mica_10_6,They're all afraid of getting pranked.
d_counseling_mica_10_7,Ha ha ha. They're all just like me!
d_counseling_mica_10_8,"Aw, man... You really think so?"
d_counseling_mica_10_9,That stinks.
d_counseling_mica_10_10,It'd be so much fun if everyone came. We could all play together...
d_counseling_mica_10_11,I have a conversation with Mica about the toy store.
d_counseling_mica_11_1,"Hey, there's this person... whenever I look at them, my heart feels funny."
d_counseling_mica_11_2,What's the deal?
d_counseling_mica_11_3,You have feelings for them.
d_counseling_mica_11_4,Probably heart disease.
d_counseling_mica_11_5,Seriously?
d_counseling_mica_11_6,But I was talking about you...
d_counseling_mica_11_7,Does that mean... I have feelings for you?
d_counseling_mica_11_8,"What?! You mean I'm sick? No, I can't be!"
d_counseling_mica_11_9,What should I do? Should I go to the hospital?
d_counseling_mica_11_10,I talk with Mica about her peculiar heart situation.
d_counseling_mica_12_1,Belorta said we should cook you up something as a gift.
d_counseling_mica_12_2,"She also said to keep it a secret, so no blabbing about it!"
d_counseling_mica_12_3,Can't wait to try it.
d_counseling_mica_12_4,I don't want to eat it.
d_counseling_mica_12_5,I'm excited to see what you think of it!
d_counseling_mica_12_6,Belorta was asking me what to put in it and she looked really excited!
d_counseling_mica_12_7,... Why? Why won't you eat it? Is it because I told you about it?
d_counseling_mica_12_8,I knew I shouldn't have told you...
d_counseling_mica_12_9,"Aw man, I'm gonna be in big trouble with Belorta now."
d_counseling_mica_12_10,Mica and I talk more about food.
d_counseling_mica_13_1,I had a terrible nightmare last night. This terrifying ghost emerged and came after me.
d_counseling_mica_13_2,What if it comes out again tonight? I don't think I can sleep.
d_counseling_mica_13_3,I'll stay with you until you fall asleep.
d_counseling_mica_13_4,"It's just a dream, so why don't you fight the ghost?"
d_counseling_mica_13_5,!!
d_counseling_mica_13_6,"Really? Hehe. Thanks, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_mica_13_7,"I might actually be able to get a peaceful night's sleep, thanks to you!"
d_counseling_mica_13_8,"Sure, but you don't realize it's a dream when you're actually dreaming."
d_counseling_mica_13_9,"It feels just like real life, that's why it's so scary."
d_counseling_mica_13_10,Mica and I talk about dreams.
d_counseling_mica_14_1,"Hey, have you ever been to an amusement park?"
d_counseling_mica_14_2,I heard there are all sorts of cool rides there and lots of good eats!
d_counseling_mica_14_3,I want to go!
d_counseling_mica_14_4,"Next time, I'll take you and Belorta."
d_counseling_mica_14_5,I'd like to go one day as well.
d_counseling_mica_14_6,Wow! Really? We'd all have a blast going together!
d_counseling_mica_14_7,I want to go! When should we go?
d_counseling_mica_14_8,I would have thought you'd gone already.
d_counseling_mica_14_9,You think there will be a day we can all go together?
d_counseling_mica_14_10,I share a conversation with Mica about amusement parks.
d_counseling_mica_15_1,I just love Belorta to death!
d_counseling_mica_15_2,"She may tease me a lot, but she doesn't really mean it."
d_counseling_mica_15_3,"I hope she'll still be around 10, even 20 years from now."
d_counseling_mica_15_4,Do you think she'll still be friends with me then?
d_counseling_mica_15_5,You never know. People change.
d_counseling_mica_15_6,I'll be there for you as well.
d_counseling_mica_15_7,"But I'm a Nikke, not a human..."
d_counseling_mica_15_8,Does anyone know whether Nikkes change or not?
d_counseling_mica_15_9,You'll be there too? That's great!
d_counseling_mica_15_10,"Me, Belorta, and you together forever!"
d_counseling_mica_15_11,Mica and I have fun chatting.
d_counseling_mica_16_1,"You're one of the good adults, Old-Timer. You're super kind."
d_counseling_mica_16_2,Are all adults like you?
d_counseling_mica_16_3,I'm afraid not.
d_counseling_mica_16_4,Yes.
d_counseling_mica_16_5,Belorta said the same thing.
d_counseling_mica_16_6,She told me you're an exception.
d_counseling_mica_16_7,"Either way, I'm just happy that you're one of the good ones!"
d_counseling_mica_16_8,Whoa! Really?
d_counseling_mica_16_9,I'm glad to hear there are lots more kind people out there like you!
d_counseling_mica_16_10,Mica and I continue our discussion.
d_counseling_mica_17_1,Old-Timer! Old-Timer! Belorta and I are gonna cook up a new firework today!
d_counseling_mica_17_2,What kind of firework should we make?
d_counseling_mica_17_3,"One that's full of color, like a rainbow."
d_counseling_mica_17_4,Something nice and loud.
d_counseling_mica_17_5,"Hmm... If pretty is all it has going for it, I'm not sure Belorta will like it..."
d_counseling_mica_17_6,I'll have to see what she says.
d_counseling_mica_17_7,"Oooh, I haven't made a really big firework before!"
d_counseling_mica_17_8,Now I'm curious! I'll go tell Belorta we have to make one!
d_counseling_mica_17_9,I have a conversation with Mica about fireworks.
d_counseling_mica_18_1,I'm officially off for the day!
d_counseling_mica_18_2,This is the first time in ages I've had some time to myself. What should I do?
d_counseling_mica_18_3,Want to hang out?
d_counseling_mica_18_4,You should try and improve yourself somehow.
d_counseling_mica_18_5,!!
d_counseling_mica_18_6,You've got time to hang out with me?
d_counseling_mica_18_7,That's awesome! What should we do?
d_counseling_mica_18_8,But... why so serious?
d_counseling_mica_18_9,It's my day off...
d_counseling_mica_18_10,Mica and I make plans to go out and have fun.
d_counseling_mica_19_1,"Belorta asked what my hobbies were today, and I didn't know how to respond."
d_counseling_mica_19_2,Is it really that important that I have a hobby?
d_counseling_mica_19_3,I'm sure we can figure something out together.
d_counseling_mica_19_4,It's good to have at least one.
d_counseling_mica_19_5,"Okay, sounds good!"
d_counseling_mica_19_6,"Now, obviously you're supposed to enjoy your hobby..."
d_counseling_mica_19_7,So what is it that I enjoy doing...
d_counseling_mica_19_8,I guess you're right about that.
d_counseling_mica_19_9,But I don't have any. Any ideas?
d_counseling_mica_19_10,Mica and I try to figure out a hobby for her.
d_counseling_mica_20_1,"Hey Old-Timer, would you prefer a world where it's always nighttime,"
d_counseling_mica_20_2,or always daytime?
d_counseling_mica_20_3,Always daytime.
d_counseling_mica_20_4,Always nighttime.
d_counseling_mica_20_5,"But if there's no nighttime, we can't set off any fireworks..."
d_counseling_mica_20_6,"If you ask me, I'd rather go without the daytime."
d_counseling_mica_20_7,"Heck yeah, who needs the daytime anyway!"
d_counseling_mica_20_8,Great minds think alike!
d_counseling_mica_20_9,I need the nighttime for setting off fireworks!
d_counseling_mica_20_10,Mica and I have a nice little chat.
d_counseling_mihara_01_1,Why do people always assume I enjoy spicy food?
d_counseling_mihara_01_2,Do I smell spicy or something?
d_counseling_mihara_01_3,It's because eating spicy food is painful.
d_counseling_mihara_01_4,It's because you give off an irritated vibe.
d_counseling_mihara_01_5,"Oh, my."
d_counseling_mihara_01_6,"Ha ha, I suppose that's true. That is why I love spicy food so much."
d_counseling_mihara_01_7,...
d_counseling_mihara_01_8,I see. I didn't realize I gave off that vibe.
d_counseling_mihara_01_9,"But what does that have to do with liking spicy food, anyway?"
d_counseling_mihara_01_10,Mihara and I experiment with the limits of spiciness.
d_counseling_mihara_02_1,Yuni is so loveable.
d_counseling_mihara_02_2,Why do you think that is?
d_counseling_mihara_02_3,Everything she does is just adorable.
d_counseling_mihara_02_4,Some people are just loveable. There's no reason behind it.
d_counseling_mihara_02_5,"You're not wrong, and yet..."
d_counseling_mihara_02_6,there are times when her whining gets on my nerves.
d_counseling_mihara_02_7,"Not everything she does is so loveable. After all, nobody's perfect."
d_counseling_mihara_02_8,Hm. That is true.
d_counseling_mihara_02_9,Trying to find the reason is pointless.
d_counseling_mihara_02_10,Love can never truly be explained.
d_counseling_mihara_02_11,I have a conversation with Mihara about Yuni.
d_counseling_mihara_03_1,"Commander, what do you think my type is?"
d_counseling_mihara_03_2,"Um... when it comes to boys, I mean."
d_counseling_mihara_03_3,"Tall, good-looking, and a great personality."
d_counseling_mihara_03_4,Someone who can accommodate your... preferences.
d_counseling_mihara_03_5,"Ha ha! You're right. That would be like a dream come true. But, I suppose everyone wants the same thing."
d_counseling_mihara_03_6,"Actually, I've already met the man of my dreams."
d_counseling_mihara_03_7,"And, as a matter of fact, he's somewhere very close by."
d_counseling_mihara_03_8,Hm... Not necessarily.
d_counseling_mihara_03_9,"A man who can accommodate me would be nice, but that's far from being my ideal type."
d_counseling_mihara_03_10,I spend time with Mihara talking about our celebrity crushes.
d_counseling_mihara_04_1,I was out on a mission capturing a Rapture when a thought crossed my mind.
d_counseling_mihara_04_2,I realized that I have a natural talent for this sort of work.
d_counseling_mihara_04_3,"Commander, what do you think I would be? If I wasn't a Nikke, of course."
d_counseling_mihara_04_4,... A shepherd?
d_counseling_mihara_04_5,... A bounty hunter?
d_counseling_mihara_04_6,A shepherd?
d_counseling_mihara_04_7,Hm... sounds kind of fun.
d_counseling_mihara_04_8,"But I think I'm better suited to dealing with humans, not animals."
d_counseling_mihara_04_9,Yes... I think that would suit me very well.
d_counseling_mihara_04_10,It has some decent thrill to it as well.
d_counseling_mihara_04_11,"If I decide to do that later on, would you be interested in joining me?"
d_counseling_mihara_04_12,I listen to Mihara's detailed lecture on how to tie people up.
d_counseling_mihara_05_1,I always want to share the stuff I'm into with others.
d_counseling_mihara_05_2,"However, I always feel like there's so much distance between me and everyone else."
d_counseling_mihara_05_3,Is there any way I can get rid of that distance?
d_counseling_mihara_05_4,Take your time and use your powers of persuasion.
d_counseling_mihara_05_5,Use your experience to make them fall for you.
d_counseling_mihara_05_6,I suppose that is the right thing to do.
d_counseling_mihara_05_7,Some things just take time to get used to.
d_counseling_mihara_05_8,"I'll take my time. I'll go really slow.
I'll make them understand, bit by bit..."
d_counseling_mihara_05_9,Ha ha. It's an appealing proposition.
d_counseling_mihara_05_10,"However, I'm not entirely sure I can make that work every time."
d_counseling_mihara_05_11,"Though, trying might be fun in its own way..."
d_counseling_mihara_05_12,I have a deep conversation with Mihara about her preferences.
d_counseling_mihara_06_1,"The line between pain and pleasure is so, so thin."
d_counseling_mihara_06_2,"Sometimes you're being crushed by pain you can barely take,
and the next moment it crosses the line into intense pleasure."
d_counseling_mihara_06_3,"Doesn't it make you curious, Commander?"
d_counseling_mihara_06_4,Not one bit.
d_counseling_mihara_06_5,"I'm curious, but it kind of scares me."
d_counseling_mihara_06_6,Hm... really?
d_counseling_mihara_06_7,I thought you'd at least be somewhat interested. I guess I was wrong.
d_counseling_mihara_06_8,Ha ha. New things are always a bit intimidating.
d_counseling_mihara_06_9,Don't be scared. We can take it one step at a time. I'll show you everything.
d_counseling_mihara_06_10,I watch a video of painful parkour fails with Mihara.
d_counseling_mihara_07_1,There are so many stores on the Royal Road.
d_counseling_mihara_07_2,"One of them is very, very secretive and mysterious."
d_counseling_mihara_07_3,Doesn't that make you curious?
d_counseling_mihara_07_4,Let's go right now.
d_counseling_mihara_07_5,... Not really.
d_counseling_mihara_07_6,"Oh, my. Really?"
d_counseling_mihara_07_7,Lovely. I hear they actually let you use their merchandise in the store.
d_counseling_mihara_07_8,Let's go have some fun. Okay?
d_counseling_mihara_07_9,"Oh, my! You're not embarrassed, are you?"
d_counseling_mihara_07_10,Hm... I didn't expect that. I thought you were a bit more adventurous.
d_counseling_mihara_07_11,"Oh, well. It doesn't matter. I'll go there with Yuni later."
d_counseling_mihara_07_12,Mihara tells me more about the unique items that can be found on Royal Road.
d_counseling_mihara_08_1,Taking care of your body is important.
d_counseling_mihara_08_2,"If I want to keep enjoying my particular hobbies for a long time, I'll need to keep my body in tip-top shape."
d_counseling_mihara_08_3,"Speaking of which, do you have any health tips you can share?"
d_counseling_mihara_08_4,Consistent exercise and a good diet.
d_counseling_mihara_08_5,Stay away from stressful situations.
d_counseling_mihara_08_6,"Commander, those things don't really apply to a Nikke..."
d_counseling_mihara_08_7,Wouldn't it be better to focus more on the mental side of things?
d_counseling_mihara_08_8,Yes! That's the most important thing.
d_counseling_mihara_08_9,"Ha ha. I always thought that, as a Commander, you would always be stressed out by your work."
d_counseling_mihara_08_10,Perhaps I was wrong?
d_counseling_mihara_08_11,Just like I thought. You are exceptional.
d_counseling_mihara_08_12,I watch a video about mental health with Mihara.
d_counseling_mihara_09_1,These clothes I'm wearing...
d_counseling_mihara_09_2,Are they a little... weird?
d_counseling_mihara_09_3,I think they're very nice.
d_counseling_mihara_09_4,Something a little more modest might be better...
d_counseling_mihara_09_5,"Ha ha! Really? Okay, then."
d_counseling_mihara_09_6,"As long as the Commander likes them, I couldn't care less what other people think."
d_counseling_mihara_09_7,"But... this is modest! For me, at least..."
d_counseling_mihara_09_8,"At this rate, I'll have to walk around in a burlap sack..."
d_counseling_mihara_09_9,I spend time with Mihara looking at fashion magazines.
d_counseling_mihara_10_1,Yuni has been rather busy lately.
d_counseling_mihara_10_2,I haven't been able to see her that much.
d_counseling_mihara_10_3,Do you think there's something going on?
d_counseling_mihara_10_4,Have you ever considered that she may just need some rest?
d_counseling_mihara_10_5,I'm sure she is working on some new skills.
d_counseling_mihara_10_6,No way.
d_counseling_mihara_10_7,"Yuni never stops, no matter what."
d_counseling_mihara_10_8,I'm worried. I really should go pay her a visit.
d_counseling_mihara_10_9,"Oh, my. Just hearing that makes my body quiver."
d_counseling_mihara_10_10,You're probably right. Yuni must be preparing a special surprise for me.
d_counseling_mihara_10_11,I'll just have to wait and see what it is!
d_counseling_mihara_10_12,Listen to Mihara gush about Yuni.
d_counseling_mihara_11_1,Check out this new leather strap that I bought.
d_counseling_mihara_11_2,"What do you think? Get a good look at it, and make sure to feel it."
d_counseling_mihara_11_3,Touch it.
d_counseling_mihara_11_4,Don't touch it.
d_counseling_mihara_11_5,"Such a smooth texture, right? And sturdy as well."
d_counseling_mihara_11_6,Do you like it?
d_counseling_mihara_11_7,"Hehe, don't be afraid."
d_counseling_mihara_11_8,I won't ask you to tie me up until you've gotten used to all of this.
d_counseling_mihara_11_9,Seems you're still a bit put off by all this.
d_counseling_mihara_11_10,"What a shame. Fine then, we'll find something else to play with."
d_counseling_mihara_11_11,Mihara helped broaden my horizons and shared some scandalous information.
d_counseling_mihara_12_1,I've used up all my scented candles so I'm going to buy some more.
d_counseling_mihara_12_2,Which scent should I buy?
d_counseling_mihara_12_3,I wanted to get something that you'd like.
d_counseling_mihara_12_4,Something sweet.
d_counseling_mihara_12_5,Something refreshing.
d_counseling_mihara_12_6,The one I used before had a sweet scent...
d_counseling_mihara_12_7,"Well, if that's what you want..."
d_counseling_mihara_12_8,"I suppose I can buy the same thing again. I'll be using it on you, after all."
d_counseling_mihara_12_9,That's exactly what I was thinking!
d_counseling_mihara_12_10,"That's good, I was really looking forward to trying out something new."
d_counseling_mihara_12_11,We can have some fun using it together.
d_counseling_mihara_12_12,Mihara taught me all sorts of new things about candles.
d_counseling_mihara_13_1,"Commander, do you know why I take such pleasure in salacious activities?"
d_counseling_mihara_13_2,Because you like pain.
d_counseling_mihara_13_3,Because you want to be controlled by others.
d_counseling_mihara_13_4,"Hehe, you're very perceptive at times."
d_counseling_mihara_13_5,Correct. Pain makes you realize you are alive.
d_counseling_mihara_13_6,That's what I love so much about it.
d_counseling_mihara_13_7,Huh? That's not true at all.
d_counseling_mihara_13_8,It's the other way around. I enjoy controlling others.
d_counseling_mihara_13_9,I have a conversation with Mihara about her turn-ons and turn-offs.
d_counseling_mihara_14_1,"Commander, if you had to choose between"
d_counseling_mihara_14_2,"something new and something familiar, which would you pick?"
d_counseling_mihara_14_3,Something new.
d_counseling_mihara_14_4,Something familiar.
d_counseling_mihara_14_5,"I see, so the same as me."
d_counseling_mihara_14_6,I get a thrill from new experiences as well.
d_counseling_mihara_14_7,"Once I get too familiar with something, it no longer stimulates me."
d_counseling_mihara_14_8,Interesting...
d_counseling_mihara_14_9,"Personally, I enjoy new experiences."
d_counseling_mihara_14_10,"If I don't move on to something new, it quickly gets stale for me."
d_counseling_mihara_14_11,Mihara and I concoct various ways to find stimulation.
d_counseling_mihara_15_1,"Since the weather is so nice, I was thinking of going for a walk."
d_counseling_mihara_15_2,What should I take with me?
d_counseling_mihara_15_3,A packed lunch.
d_counseling_mihara_15_4,"A leash, maybe?"
d_counseling_mihara_15_5,"As long as you pack it for me, sure!"
d_counseling_mihara_15_6,I'd love to go on a nice little picnic.
d_counseling_mihara_15_7,It should be a nice change of pace.
d_counseling_mihara_15_8,Such a new experience... I'm tingling with anticipation!
d_counseling_mihara_15_9,I just wanted to walk around the Outpost.
d_counseling_mihara_15_10,What exactly did you have in mind?
d_counseling_mihara_15_11,"You little pervert, hehe."
d_counseling_mihara_15_12,I went on a walk with Mihara.
d_counseling_mihara_16_1,"Commander, between the mind and the body,"
d_counseling_mihara_16_2,which do you think is more important?
d_counseling_mihara_16_3,Body.
d_counseling_mihara_16_4,Mind.
d_counseling_mihara_16_5,Hmm... really? I suppose that's because you're a human.
d_counseling_mihara_16_6,"If your body sustains any injuries, you don't recover so easily, so I understand why you would feel that way."
d_counseling_mihara_16_7,"Personally, I think it's more frightening to suffer a mental collapse."
d_counseling_mihara_16_8,Me too.
d_counseling_mihara_16_9,The mind is capable of inflicting far more pain than the body ever could.
d_counseling_mihara_16_10,Mihara and I have a discussion about the correlation between the body and mind.
d_counseling_mihara_17_1,I was considering getting some exercise.
d_counseling_mihara_17_2,What type of exercise do you think would best suit me?
d_counseling_mihara_17_3,Jump rope.
d_counseling_mihara_17_4,I thought Nikkes didn't have to exercise?
d_counseling_mihara_17_5,Yes... The pain of constantly jumping over a rope that is about to hit you.
d_counseling_mihara_17_6,"The sting when it finally makes contact, and the fact that you brought this pain upon yourself..."
d_counseling_mihara_17_7,It's perfect.
d_counseling_mihara_17_8,"You're right,"
d_counseling_mihara_17_9,but I've had an urge recently to get my body in motion.
d_counseling_mihara_17_10,"If you don't have any recommendations, then I'll just have to figure it out myself."
d_counseling_mihara_17_11,Mihara and I talk about exercise.
d_counseling_mihara_18_1,"Commander, have you ever had the urge to steal"
d_counseling_mihara_18_2,something from someone else?
d_counseling_mihara_18_3,"No, I haven't."
d_counseling_mihara_18_4,"Yes, I have."
d_counseling_mihara_18_5,I figured as much.
d_counseling_mihara_18_6,I knew you and I were different.
d_counseling_mihara_18_7,"Well, I've stolen before."
d_counseling_mihara_18_8,"You're not pulling my leg, are you?"
d_counseling_mihara_18_9,"It's nice to know that we have something in common,"
d_counseling_mihara_18_10,even if it's rather unexpected.
d_counseling_mihara_18_11,I was so envious of someone else's life that I wanted to steal their very essence.
d_counseling_mihara_18_12,Perhaps that is how I came to have this ability.
d_counseling_mihara_18_13,I spend time talking with Mihara.
d_counseling_mihara_19_1,"I have to be honest with you Commander, I've been keeping a secret from you this entire time."
d_counseling_mihara_19_2,Can you guess what it is?
d_counseling_mihara_19_3,I'll let you know if you get it right?
d_counseling_mihara_19_4,"But if you tell me, it'll no longer be a secret."
d_counseling_mihara_19_5,You know Syuene's weakness?
d_counseling_mihara_19_6,"Very true. By definition, a secret is only a secret when no one else knows."
d_counseling_mihara_19_7,"The moment I tell you what it is, it will cease to be a secret."
d_counseling_mihara_19_8,"You're a tough nut to crack, Commander."
d_counseling_mihara_19_9,I think that's what I like about you.
d_counseling_mihara_19_10,"Let me see... correct, or incorrect?"
d_counseling_mihara_19_11,"As soon as I tell you it's correct, it no longer becomes a secret."
d_counseling_mihara_19_12,Therefore I can't tell you.
d_counseling_mihara_19_13,Mihara and I talk about secrets.
d_counseling_mihara_20_1,"Commander, which do you think is more precious?"
d_counseling_mihara_20_2,"The memories you've already accumulated, or the memories you'll create in the future?"
d_counseling_mihara_20_3,All the previous memories I've gathered.
d_counseling_mihara_20_4,The memories I'll create in the future.
d_counseling_mihara_20_5,Why?
d_counseling_mihara_20_6,They've made me into the person I am today.
d_counseling_mihara_20_7,Hmm... my view differs slightly.
d_counseling_mihara_20_8,I feel I'm a much better person now than I was in the past.
d_counseling_mihara_20_9,Why?
d_counseling_mihara_20_10,Because the person I am now will be the one making those new memories.
d_counseling_mihara_20_11,Precisely!
d_counseling_mihara_20_12,I couldn't agree more.
d_counseling_mihara_20_13,I've always preferred my current self to who I was in the past.
d_counseling_mihara_20_14,"Therefore, it's a no-brainer that the experiences I'm having now are superior to those of the past."
d_counseling_mihara_20_15,Mihara and I talk about the concept of memories.
d_counseling_milk_01_1,"Hey, Pal, how about sparring? You and me?"
d_counseling_milk_01_2,"Come on. For fun.
You're not chicken, are you?"
d_counseling_milk_01_3,I promise I'll go easy on you.
d_counseling_milk_01_4,An amateur going easy on a pro?
d_counseling_milk_01_5,"Please, be gentle with me."
d_counseling_milk_01_6,Oooh! You seem confident.
d_counseling_milk_01_7,"Get ready, then. I'll give you everything I've got!"
d_counseling_milk_01_8,Mmm... Okay.
d_counseling_milk_01_9,"You're more of a chicken than I thought, Pal."
d_counseling_milk_01_10,Really surprising.
d_counseling_milk_01_11,"I spend time with Milk, sparring."
d_counseling_milk_02_1,"Hey, you ever put milk in your coffee?"
d_counseling_milk_02_2,What's your milk-to-coffee ratio?
d_counseling_milk_02_3,"Milk 9, coffee 1."
d_counseling_milk_02_4,"Milk 5, coffee 5."
d_counseling_milk_02_5,Can you even call that coffee?
d_counseling_milk_02_6,Right? That's the best ratio.
d_counseling_milk_02_7,"I both like coffee and milk, so having it in equal parts is just right!"
d_counseling_milk_02_8,That's my kind of coffee.
d_counseling_milk_02_9,I talk with Milk over some coffee.
d_counseling_milk_03_1,"I love hand-to-hand combat, but nobody around here can match my muscle. It gets kinda lonely."
d_counseling_milk_03_2,You know of any worthy opponents?
d_counseling_milk_03_3,Milk.
d_counseling_milk_03_4,Sugar.
d_counseling_milk_03_5,Me?
d_counseling_milk_03_6,Hah! Right. The only worthy opponent is me. Makes sense.
d_counseling_milk_03_7,"After all, I'm the best there is."
d_counseling_milk_03_8,Sugar?
d_counseling_milk_03_9,Do you know what she'd do if she got really fired up?
d_counseling_milk_03_10,She'd run me over with her bike.
d_counseling_milk_03_11,I study hand-to-hand combat with Milk.
d_counseling_milk_04_1,"Sometimes, I get assignments where I have to scavenge really carefully."
d_counseling_milk_04_2,I hate them so much.
d_counseling_milk_04_3,Can't I just get requests where I get to destroy things?
d_counseling_milk_04_4,It's worth a shot.
d_counseling_milk_04_5,"But you're a scavenger, not a destroyer."
d_counseling_milk_04_6,Oh! So you think I should give it a try?
d_counseling_milk_04_7,...
d_counseling_milk_04_8,... That kind of request is very rare.
d_counseling_milk_04_9,It's perfect for the adventure-hungry Nikke.
d_counseling_milk_04_10,Hmmm. That's true.
d_counseling_milk_04_11,"Well, if I wanted to become a destroyer, I would have found another squad."
d_counseling_milk_04_12,I talk with Milk about being delicate.
d_counseling_milk_05_1,Hey. You know our cafe?
d_counseling_milk_05_2,It's just as good as that other one in the Ark.
d_counseling_milk_05_3,That's why I want to hire an ad agency for it. Any recommendations?
d_counseling_milk_05_4,Mustang.
d_counseling_milk_05_5,The Talentum squad.
d_counseling_milk_05_6,...
d_counseling_milk_05_7,That could work.
d_counseling_milk_05_8,That will absolutely work.
d_counseling_milk_05_9,They are pretty amazing.
d_counseling_milk_05_10,"But, how do I say this...
They lack a certain explosive quality."
d_counseling_milk_05_11,I will put them on the list for now.
d_counseling_milk_05_12,I talk to Milk about ways to promote the cafe.
d_counseling_milk_06_1,"Yesterday, I got up in the middle of the night to drink some water."
d_counseling_milk_06_2,"But, I stepped on Frima's back. She was just sleeping there on the floor."
d_counseling_milk_06_3,"She got really worked up about it. But, is it really my fault?"
d_counseling_milk_06_4,It is your fault.
d_counseling_milk_06_5,It's Frima's fault.
d_counseling_milk_06_6,What did I do wrong?!
d_counseling_milk_06_7,"Isn't it common sense not to sleep on the last step of the stairs? Or anywhere on the stairs, for that matter?"
d_counseling_milk_06_8,Right? Don't you think so?
d_counseling_milk_06_9,It's her fault for falling asleep on the stairs.
d_counseling_milk_06_10,"If she does it again, I'll sit on her and crush her."
d_counseling_milk_06_11,I talk to Milk about Frima's sleeping habits.
d_counseling_milk_07_1,Sugar is so noisy.
d_counseling_milk_07_2,"Well, not Sugar herself. It's her bike."
d_counseling_milk_07_3,I can't stand that annoying *vroooooom* sound.
d_counseling_milk_07_4,Let's put a silencer on it!
d_counseling_milk_07_5,Let's break her bike!
d_counseling_milk_07_6,Hey! That's a great idea.
d_counseling_milk_07_7,That'll put a stop to the noise for sure.
d_counseling_milk_07_8,Isn't that... overkill?
d_counseling_milk_07_9,You know how much Sugar cares about her bike.
d_counseling_milk_07_10,I have a conversation with Milk about Sugar's bike.
d_counseling_milk_08_1,"Hey, Pal..."
d_counseling_milk_08_2,Do you think I look... uh... violent?
d_counseling_milk_08_3,Yes. Like an angry gorilla.
d_counseling_milk_08_4,Not at all. I think you're cute.
d_counseling_milk_08_5,You...!! What did you just say!?
d_counseling_milk_08_6,Do you want to taste my gorilla punch!?
d_counseling_milk_08_7,What's with this all of a sudden?!
d_counseling_milk_08_8,"Y-you shouldn't say ""cute"" to a grown lady, you loser!"
d_counseling_milk_08_9,"I spend time with Milk, teasing her."
d_counseling_milk_09_1,Do you know what a Hadouken is?
d_counseling_milk_09_2,"They say if you get good enough at martial arts, you can shoot a wave of energy out of your bare hands."
d_counseling_milk_09_3,I wanna learn how to do that...
d_counseling_milk_09_4,But aren't guns much better?
d_counseling_milk_09_5,The only way to find out is to train.
d_counseling_milk_09_6,...
d_counseling_milk_09_7,I guess you're right.
d_counseling_milk_09_8,A bullet is probably stronger than anything I can make from my hands.
d_counseling_milk_09_9,You want me to just train without knowing any particular method?
d_counseling_milk_09_10,... Stupid. That'll be a waste of time.
d_counseling_milk_09_11,I research special martial arts techniques with Milk.
d_counseling_milk_10_1,Sugar has her bike.
d_counseling_milk_10_2,Frima has her sofa.
d_counseling_milk_10_3,I also need something as my mount.
d_counseling_milk_10_4,A sofa isn't a mount.
d_counseling_milk_10_5,What about me?
d_counseling_milk_10_6,Well she sure rides it like one.
d_counseling_milk_10_7,Who knows? It might fly off into the sky someday.
d_counseling_milk_10_8,"Oh? You're saying I can ride on you, Pal?"
d_counseling_milk_10_9,"Hmm... a Pal you can ride, huh..."
d_counseling_milk_10_10,...
d_counseling_milk_10_11,Uh... wait. That came off a little naughty.
d_counseling_milk_10_12,I talk with Milk about mounts.
d_counseling_milk_11_1,"Hey, Pal..."
d_counseling_milk_11_2,"This is just a question, okay?"
d_counseling_milk_11_3,What would you think of me wearing a dress?
d_counseling_milk_11_4,I just might fall in love with one glance.
d_counseling_milk_11_5,It would be hilarious.
d_counseling_milk_11_6,R-really?
d_counseling_milk_11_7,"Ah, you know, I just happened to get one, so...!"
d_counseling_milk_11_8,I will go try it on and you will...!
d_counseling_milk_11_9,"No way! You absolutely won't!
Forget I said anything!"
d_counseling_milk_11_10,...
d_counseling_milk_11_11,Hilarious? You think it would be funny?
d_counseling_milk_11_12,Do I look like I'm joking?
d_counseling_milk_11_13,Do you want me to give you something to laugh about? Do you?!
d_counseling_milk_11_14,"I spend time with Milk, talking about her looks."
d_counseling_milk_12_1,"If I wasn't a Scavenger,"
d_counseling_milk_12_2,what do you think I'd be doing?
d_counseling_milk_12_3,Boxing.
d_counseling_milk_12_4,"Unemployed, most likely."
d_counseling_milk_12_5,That doesn't sound too bad.
d_counseling_milk_12_6,"I'd fight my way to the top, win the prize money, then live high off the hog for the next few months."
d_counseling_milk_12_7,"After that, I'd... Actually, should I even be thinking this far out?"
d_counseling_milk_12_8,... Are you done?
d_counseling_milk_12_9,"This job isn't the be-all and end-all in my life, you know."
d_counseling_milk_12_10,"There's more to me than that. Never mind, forget I said anything."
d_counseling_milk_12_11,Milk and I talk about her future prospects.
d_counseling_milk_13_1,"All right, let's flip a coin."
d_counseling_milk_13_2,"Heads, you've gotta grant one of my wishes. Tails, I grant one of yours."
d_counseling_milk_13_3,Okay?
d_counseling_milk_13_4,Go for it.
d_counseling_milk_13_5,First I want to make sure it's not a double-sided coin.
d_counseling_milk_13_6,"All right, let's do this."
d_counseling_milk_13_7,Milk lightly flips the coin.
d_counseling_milk_13_8,Heads!
d_counseling_milk_13_9,"That's too bad for you, buddy. Looks like you'll be spending the day with me."
d_counseling_milk_13_10,Hey! What kind of person do you think I am?
d_counseling_milk_13_11,You really think I'd use a cheap trick like rigging the coin?
d_counseling_milk_13_12,You ever considered that it could just be a bum coin?
d_counseling_milk_13_13,Milk and I start bickering with one another.
d_counseling_milk_14_1,The café has been a ghost town lately. No idea why...
d_counseling_milk_14_2,What do you think is causing this?
d_counseling_milk_14_3,It's because of Frima.
d_counseling_milk_14_4,It's because of you.
d_counseling_milk_14_5,I was thinking the same thing.
d_counseling_milk_14_6,That lazy oaf never serves a single customer and just sleeps all day.
d_counseling_milk_14_7,"This place is so dead, there might as well be buzzards circling above our heads."
d_counseling_milk_14_8,Come again? Are you trying to start a fight?
d_counseling_milk_14_9,"What did I ever do? I get into a few fights with customers,"
d_counseling_milk_14_10,and suddenly I'm the sole reason that business is suffering?
d_counseling_milk_14_11,Milk and I racked our brains as to why the café was losing customers.
d_counseling_milk_15_1,What do you think of a girl who does martial arts?
d_counseling_milk_15_2,Be as objective as possible.
d_counseling_milk_15_3,I think it's awesome.
d_counseling_milk_15_4,I think it's a little intimidating.
d_counseling_milk_15_5,No kidding?
d_counseling_milk_15_6,I guess most people would feel the same way.
d_counseling_milk_15_7,Why is my face getting so red all of a sudden?
d_counseling_milk_15_8,What the hell?!
d_counseling_milk_15_9,So are you saying that I should give up on martial arts? Is that it?!
d_counseling_milk_15_10,"It's not like I smack you around or anything. On the contrary, I've protected you more times than I can count!"
d_counseling_milk_15_11,I talk to Milk about the correlation between martial arts and attractiveness.
d_counseling_milk_16_1,"If I punched someone, how many weeks do you think they would need to recover?"
d_counseling_milk_16_2,I'm not sure about weeks... days would be more like it.
d_counseling_milk_16_3,I don't know... 12 weeks?
d_counseling_milk_16_4,What was that? Say that to my face!
d_counseling_milk_16_5,Get over here so I can bop you one.
d_counseling_milk_16_6,"Wowee, you really think my punch is that powerful?"
d_counseling_milk_16_7,12 weeks is a long time though... what if they ended up croaking?
d_counseling_milk_16_8,"Eh, whatever, you hit the nail on the head at any rate. You're a good egg!"
d_counseling_milk_16_9,Milk and I talk more about her punching skills.
d_counseling_milk_17_1,I had someone tell me today that it might be beneficial for me to change how I talk to people.
d_counseling_milk_17_2,"I told them, ""I think punching you right in the mouth would be beneficial for me."""
d_counseling_milk_17_3,Do you think there's something wrong with how I talk to people?
d_counseling_milk_17_4,I get a big kick out of how you talk to me.
d_counseling_milk_17_5,I think you could afford to tone down the aggression...
d_counseling_milk_17_6,"You always have the right answer, Pal."
d_counseling_milk_17_7,I wasn't intending on changing it anyways.
d_counseling_milk_17_8,There's no need to!
d_counseling_milk_17_9,I think how I'm talking now is plenty friendly.
d_counseling_milk_17_10,But it doesn't look like you agree with me...
d_counseling_milk_17_11,Milk and I discuss how she could possibly change her way of speaking.
d_counseling_milk_18_1,"Hey, are you up for a match?"
d_counseling_milk_18_2,The loser has to take a sucker punch. How about it?
d_counseling_milk_18_3,Just hit me and get it over with.
d_counseling_milk_18_4,Agreed.
d_counseling_milk_18_5,"Pfft, boooorrring."
d_counseling_milk_18_6,Have you always been this weak?
d_counseling_milk_18_7,"All right, this'll be fun!"
d_counseling_milk_18_8,Let's see who has to be the punching bag.
d_counseling_milk_18_9,Game on!
d_counseling_milk_18_10,I tried with all my might not to lose to Milk.
d_counseling_milk_19_1,I've been thinking about entering a martial arts competition.
d_counseling_milk_19_2,One's being held near here soon.
d_counseling_milk_19_3,"If you do enter, you'll be the champion for sure."
d_counseling_milk_19_4,There are a lot of people who are great at martial arts.
d_counseling_milk_19_5,You think so too?
d_counseling_milk_19_6,Now I'm really interested.
d_counseling_milk_19_7,come again? Are you trying to start a fight?
d_counseling_milk_19_8,What of it?
d_counseling_milk_19_9,"I know there are a lot of capable fighters out there, but I won't lose to any of them."
d_counseling_milk_19_10,Milk and I looked for additional martial arts competitions.
d_counseling_milk_20_1,"I had a Milk Tea yesterday, and it was delicious as always."
d_counseling_milk_20_2,Anything's good if it's got milk in it.
d_counseling_milk_20_3,Milk thistle is pretty gross.
d_counseling_milk_20_4,I also like milk.
d_counseling_milk_20_5,... Is that supposed to be a joke?
d_counseling_milk_20_6,You need to work on your sense of humor... talk about corny...
d_counseling_milk_20_7,So you like milk too?
d_counseling_milk_20_8,...
d_counseling_milk_20_9,"Wait, are you talking about the drink, or me?"
d_counseling_milk_20_10,Damn you! Be more clear next time!
d_counseling_milk_20_11,Milk and I have fun chit-chatting.
d_counseling_miranda_01_1,Commander! You really don't want to mess with Poli today!
d_counseling_miranda_01_2,"You see, I was working hard, as usual..."
d_counseling_miranda_01_3,"But Poli got mad at me! She was in such a bad mood, I just had to get out of there!"
d_counseling_miranda_01_4,"Now that I'm out of the office, I have no idea what to do! Any ideas?"
d_counseling_miranda_01_5,Ask Poli to play with you.
d_counseling_miranda_01_6,Tell Poli you're sorry.
d_counseling_miranda_01_7,!!
d_counseling_miranda_01_8,Great idea!
d_counseling_miranda_01_9,"If Poli joins me, it may help her take a load off."
d_counseling_miranda_01_10,"You're so smart, Commander!"
d_counseling_miranda_01_11,I already tried that!
d_counseling_miranda_01_12,"She's still fuming, though."
d_counseling_miranda_01_13,Looks like all I can do is go out and have fun on my own!
d_counseling_miranda_01_14,I explore ways to help with Miranda amuse herself.
d_counseling_miranda_02_1,Poli chewed me out because I said she reminds me of a puppy.
d_counseling_miranda_02_2,Should I have told her she's more like a cat instead?
d_counseling_miranda_02_3,Yes.
d_counseling_miranda_02_4,No.
d_counseling_miranda_02_5,You think so?
d_counseling_miranda_02_6,"If you say so, then I'll go tell her right away!"
d_counseling_miranda_02_7,I'm sure it'll make her happy!
d_counseling_miranda_02_8,"So that's a no-go, too?"
d_counseling_miranda_02_9,...
d_counseling_miranda_02_10,She's such a mystery...
d_counseling_miranda_02_11,I have a conversation with Miranda about Poli.
d_counseling_miranda_03_1,They say that nice weather can put you in a good mood.
d_counseling_miranda_03_2,"I'm not sure how that works, though."
d_counseling_miranda_03_3,It's because rain is so inconvenient.
d_counseling_miranda_03_4,It doesn't. I'm in a bad mood even on beautiful days.
d_counseling_miranda_03_5,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_miranda_03_6,It's better to work on a nice day than a rainy day!
d_counseling_miranda_03_7,Now I get it!
d_counseling_miranda_03_8,Really?
d_counseling_miranda_03_9,That's... not what I expected you to say...
d_counseling_miranda_03_10,Just forget I asked.
d_counseling_miranda_03_11,I have a discussion with Miranda about the relationship between weather and moods.
d_counseling_miranda_04_1,"Today, while I was working my beat,"
d_counseling_miranda_04_2,someone asked me if I was a new recruit.
d_counseling_miranda_04_3,They just knew! I didn't say anything and they already knew!
d_counseling_miranda_04_4,How could they have known?
d_counseling_miranda_04_5,You can tell just by looking at your face.
d_counseling_miranda_04_6,You can tell by the way you act.
d_counseling_miranda_04_7,My face? Do I have the face of a rookie?
d_counseling_miranda_04_8,That's weird... I don't think it's that obvious at all...
d_counseling_miranda_04_9,The way I act?
d_counseling_miranda_04_10,"Well, it happened while I was directing traffic."
d_counseling_miranda_04_11,"I heard that waiting in lines was the most efficient way to do things,"
d_counseling_miranda_04_12,so I blocked the road and asked everyone to line up in a single file.
d_counseling_miranda_04_13,The other officers really gave me an earful!
d_counseling_miranda_04_14,I think that might be the reason why!
d_counseling_miranda_04_15,Miranda tells me more about the daily life of a rookie police officer.
d_counseling_miranda_05_1,"Commander, do you ever wonder about the future?"
d_counseling_miranda_05_2,I do. I wonder if I'll ever become an accomplished police officer.
d_counseling_miranda_05_3,I'm sure you will.
d_counseling_miranda_05_4,I wouldn't get your hopes up.
d_counseling_miranda_05_5,The fact that you trust me really gives me confidence!
d_counseling_miranda_05_6,I'll do my best!
d_counseling_miranda_05_7,I'm not saying it'll happen overnight or anything!
d_counseling_miranda_05_8,"Anyway, if you're gonna dream, you gotta dream big!"
d_counseling_miranda_05_9,What's wrong with that?
d_counseling_miranda_05_10,I chat with Miranda about how to become an accomplished police officer.
d_counseling_miranda_06_1,"Commander, can I tell you something?"
d_counseling_miranda_06_2,People always tell me I don't have to work so hard.
d_counseling_miranda_06_3,"But, isn't working hard a good thing?"
d_counseling_miranda_06_4,Not always.
d_counseling_miranda_06_5,Yes! Nothing in the world is more important than hard work!
d_counseling_miranda_06_6,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_miranda_06_7,Well... I still want to work hard.
d_counseling_miranda_06_8,"I thought so! I knew you would say that, Commander!"
d_counseling_miranda_06_9,Thank you.
d_counseling_miranda_06_10,I won't let you down!
d_counseling_miranda_06_11,I work with Miranda to find ways for her to work even harder.
d_counseling_miranda_07_1,The safety of everyone inside the Ark is my responsibility.
d_counseling_miranda_07_2,"I said that out loud today, and a boy on the street giggled!"
d_counseling_miranda_07_3,He must have thought what I was telling a joke or something.
d_counseling_miranda_07_4,I don't see what's so funny about it!
d_counseling_miranda_07_5,Maybe it was because you were talking too loud.
d_counseling_miranda_07_6,It might be better not to know.
d_counseling_miranda_07_7,!!
d_counseling_miranda_07_8,That's true. I was talking very loudly.
d_counseling_miranda_07_9,I guess I can see how that's a little funny.
d_counseling_miranda_07_10,"Mystery solved. Thanks, Commander!"
d_counseling_miranda_07_11,"Wait, there are some things that it's better if you don't know?"
d_counseling_miranda_07_12,*Sigh* There's so much I still don't understand about this world.
d_counseling_miranda_07_13,I listen to Miranda about her daily life at work.
d_counseling_miranda_08_1,"I think, in order to become a good detective,"
d_counseling_miranda_08_2,I'll need to work hard to improve myself.
d_counseling_miranda_08_3,What do you think I should work on first?
d_counseling_miranda_08_4,What about your intelligence?
d_counseling_miranda_08_5,Work on your resilience.
d_counseling_miranda_08_6,??
d_counseling_miranda_08_7,Why do I have to improve that?
d_counseling_miranda_08_8,I'm already a quick learner!
d_counseling_miranda_08_9,"Now, that's really true!"
d_counseling_miranda_08_10,I think that's a good idea.
d_counseling_miranda_08_11,"Starting today, I'll work to improve my resilience."
d_counseling_miranda_08_12,I discuss self-improvement with Miranda.
d_counseling_miranda_09_1,"Commander, I have a question."
d_counseling_miranda_09_2,"People say that if you want to be successful, then you need to have a dream."
d_counseling_miranda_09_3,"I'm not sure how successful I want to become, so do I need a dream?"
d_counseling_miranda_09_4,How successful do you think I'll be?
d_counseling_miranda_09_5,You'll definitely climb to the top of the ladder.
d_counseling_miranda_09_6,"When they say successful, they're talking about becoming a better person."
d_counseling_miranda_09_7,You think so?
d_counseling_miranda_09_8,That's a relief! ... I think?
d_counseling_miranda_09_9,"Hm... Actually, I'm not so sure."
d_counseling_miranda_09_10,A better person?
d_counseling_miranda_09_11,"Sounds kinda abstract, but also cool at the same time."
d_counseling_miranda_09_12,All right! I'll come up with a great dream right away!
d_counseling_miranda_09_13,I discuss potential dreams with Miranda.
d_counseling_miranda_10_1,"Commander, I was watching TV today..."
d_counseling_miranda_10_2,"They said that if you want to be healthy, you have to eat well."
d_counseling_miranda_10_3,So... exactly how much do you have to eat to be healthy?
d_counseling_miranda_10_4,You have to put everything you've got into eating!
d_counseling_miranda_10_5,You're already eating well.
d_counseling_miranda_10_6,I understand.
d_counseling_miranda_10_7,I'll focus a lot more on eating from now on.
d_counseling_miranda_10_8,I'll push myself to the limit!
d_counseling_miranda_10_9,I'll dedicate myself entirely to eating!
d_counseling_miranda_10_10,I'll be the healthiest thing to ever live!
d_counseling_miranda_10_11,Are you sure it's enough?
d_counseling_miranda_10_12,"On the TV, they said you should eat a lot..."
d_counseling_miranda_10_13,"Ugh, I'm confused."
d_counseling_miranda_10_14,I have a conversation with Miranda about eating and personal health.
d_counseling_miranda_11_1,Commander.
d_counseling_miranda_11_2,I'm going to fry some eggs for Poli today.
d_counseling_miranda_11_3,I wondering what design I should draw with the ketchup.
d_counseling_miranda_11_4,A cute puppy.
d_counseling_miranda_11_5,A traffic sign.
d_counseling_miranda_11_6,"I drew a puppy last time, and you know what Poli did?"
d_counseling_miranda_11_7,She growled at me.
d_counseling_miranda_11_8,I don't think it's a good idea to draw another one.
d_counseling_miranda_11_9,!!
d_counseling_miranda_11_10,"Very good idea, Commander!"
d_counseling_miranda_11_11,"I'll draw a ""Careful, children at play"" sign!"
d_counseling_miranda_11_12,Miranda and I try and figure out what she should draw.
d_counseling_miranda_12_1,I want to make a song about traffic control that you can play on the roads.
d_counseling_miranda_12_2,I have some lyrics that I thought of.
d_counseling_miranda_12_3,I'm just not sure if I can actually pull off the singing...
d_counseling_miranda_12_4,Are you sure it wouldn't interfere with traffic?
d_counseling_miranda_12_5,I think it'd be wonderful if you sang it.
d_counseling_miranda_12_6,"Oh, it'll interfere with the traffic?"
d_counseling_miranda_12_7,I didn't think about that...
d_counseling_miranda_12_8,"All right then, I'll put it on the back burner for now then."
d_counseling_miranda_12_9,You really think so?
d_counseling_miranda_12_10,"It's a little embarrassing, but if I can do it..."
d_counseling_miranda_12_11,I'd love to give it a try!
d_counseling_miranda_12_12,I'll ask Poli.
d_counseling_miranda_12_13,Miranda and I discuss her song.
d_counseling_miranda_13_1,"I haven't managed traffic before on a snowy day,"
d_counseling_miranda_13_2,but I think it will be fun!
d_counseling_miranda_13_3,I think I'll be staying off the roads on that day.
d_counseling_miranda_13_4,I'm sure it'll be a new experience for you.
d_counseling_miranda_13_5,Why not?
d_counseling_miranda_13_6,!!
d_counseling_miranda_13_7,Is it because you think there will be a lot of delays?
d_counseling_miranda_13_8,You don't need to worry!
d_counseling_miranda_13_9,I'll make sure that traffic flows smoothly!
d_counseling_miranda_13_10,I'm sure it will be.
d_counseling_miranda_13_11,Figuring how to conduct traffic in snowy conditions
d_counseling_miranda_13_12,will help improve my ability to think on-the-fly.
d_counseling_miranda_13_13,I hope it snows soon.
d_counseling_miranda_13_14,Miranda and I talk about conducting traffic.
d_counseling_miranda_14_1,"When I was on vacation,"
d_counseling_miranda_14_2,traffic was at a complete standstill.
d_counseling_miranda_14_3,"So I promptly sorted it all out, and came back here!"
d_counseling_miranda_14_4,It was great seeing the looks of satisfaction on people's faces.
d_counseling_miranda_14_5,Are you sure you're remembering everything correctly?
d_counseling_miranda_14_6,Reporting for duty even while on vacation! Very impressive!
d_counseling_miranda_14_7,Of course I am!
d_counseling_miranda_14_8,I saw everyone smile with my own two eyes!
d_counseling_miranda_14_9,"Please, you're making me blush!"
d_counseling_miranda_14_10,"I'm an Ark police officer,"
d_counseling_miranda_14_11,so that was nothing!
d_counseling_miranda_14_13,Miranda told me more stories about conducting traffic.
d_counseling_miranda_15_1,The Outpost is such a peaceful place.
d_counseling_miranda_15_2,... So peaceful that sometimes there's nothing to do!
d_counseling_miranda_15_3,I'm happy to come up with more work for you.
d_counseling_miranda_15_4,It's all thanks to your hard work.
d_counseling_miranda_15_5,Oh... um... about that...
d_counseling_miranda_15_6,That's okay.
d_counseling_miranda_15_7,I take back what I just said.
d_counseling_miranda_15_8,"I'm happy you feel that way, Commander!"
d_counseling_miranda_15_9,Hearing you say that makes me want to work even harder.
d_counseling_miranda_15_10,Feel free to call me if anything comes up.
d_counseling_miranda_15_11,Miranda and I talk about how peaceful the Outpost is.
d_counseling_miranda_16_1,"I thought I'd worked long enough,"
d_counseling_miranda_16_2,but my superiors still say I'm just a rookie!
d_counseling_miranda_16_3,What do I have to do to get rid of this stigma?
d_counseling_miranda_16_4,You need to see things from a broader perspective.
d_counseling_miranda_16_5,There's not much else you can do. You just have to accept it for now.
d_counseling_miranda_16_6,So what you're saying is...
d_counseling_miranda_16_7,I should go on top of a skyscraper so I can get a better view?
d_counseling_miranda_16_8,That way I'd be able to spot the criminals more easily!
d_counseling_miranda_16_9,Aw man...
d_counseling_miranda_16_10,"In other people's eyes, Poli can do no wrong. It's infuriating!"
d_counseling_miranda_16_11,I want to be like that too!
d_counseling_miranda_16_12,I speak with Miranda about the trials and tribulations of being a rookie police officer.
d_counseling_miranda_17_1,"This is kind of a strange question,"
d_counseling_miranda_17_2,but what do you think is a spy's strong suit?
d_counseling_miranda_17_3,What makes you ask a question like that?
d_counseling_miranda_17_4,Maintaining total secrecy.
d_counseling_miranda_17_5,Um... It just popped into my head randomly
d_counseling_miranda_17_6,when I was walking on the street.
d_counseling_miranda_17_7,No other reason! I'm not a spy or anything like that!
d_counseling_miranda_17_8,For sure!
d_counseling_miranda_17_9,It's paramount that a spy never reveals their identity.
d_counseling_miranda_17_10,"Anyway, I'll keep doing my best with my own job!"
d_counseling_miranda_17_11,"Even though it was still vague, I got a slightly better idea of who Miranda was."
d_counseling_miranda_18_1,I practically fell apart yesterday after eating my lunch!
d_counseling_miranda_18_2,"I thought about filing a maintenance request, but decided to just grit my teeth and push through."
d_counseling_miranda_18_3,Poli found out later though and got really upset with me...
d_counseling_miranda_18_4,Why do you think I got in trouble?
d_counseling_miranda_18_5,Managing your own condition is also a skill.
d_counseling_miranda_18_6,Because Poli cares about you.
d_counseling_miranda_18_7,Of course! How could I have been so foolish!
d_counseling_miranda_18_8,"Of course, it was because of my lack of effort!"
d_counseling_miranda_18_9,"From now on, I'll be sure to look after myself more vigilantly once I'm finished with my work."
d_counseling_miranda_18_10,!!
d_counseling_miranda_18_11,She has a strange way of showing it...she was growling at me and everything...
d_counseling_miranda_18_12,"Anyway, I'll try and be nicer to Poli from now on."
d_counseling_miranda_18_13,Miranda and I talk about managing your personal health with professional obligations.
d_counseling_miranda_19_1,It's been a while since I last had time off of work.
d_counseling_miranda_19_2,"I want everyone to know how much fun I'm having, but I'm not sure how to go about it..."
d_counseling_miranda_19_3,Can you help me spread the word?
d_counseling_miranda_19_4,Is it really that important to you?
d_counseling_miranda_19_5,What exactly should I tell them?
d_counseling_miranda_19_6,"Yes, it's extremely important to me!"
d_counseling_miranda_19_7,Poli said that my time off is just as important as the time I spend on duty.
d_counseling_miranda_19_8,So I want everyone to know that I went all out with my R&R!
d_counseling_miranda_19_9,Say that you and I went somewhere and had a total blast!
d_counseling_miranda_19_10,"... Oh, come to think of it,"
d_counseling_miranda_19_11,I forgot to mention this to you first...
d_counseling_miranda_19_12,We eventually got into a lively discussion about how Miranda should utilize her days off.
d_counseling_miranda_20_1,There's a restaurant near our office that's absolutely delicious.
d_counseling_miranda_20_2,I want to go with someone but I'm not sure how to ask them.
d_counseling_miranda_20_3,Lure them in with the idea of delicious food.
d_counseling_miranda_20_4,Play up the fact that they'll be going with you.
d_counseling_miranda_20_5,"Gotcha, I'll try and let the food do the talking, so to speak!"
d_counseling_miranda_20_6,"Erm... So, this restaurant has two signature Splendamin dishes:"
d_counseling_miranda_20_7,"Udon noodles with butter, and al dente capellini noodles with salt."
d_counseling_miranda_20_8,"Got it, I'll see what I can do!"
d_counseling_miranda_20_9,"Erm... So Commander,"
d_counseling_miranda_20_10,"I'd really like to take you to this restaurant, even if I end up spending my entire paycheck. Would you care to join me?"
d_counseling_miranda_20_11,I made an appointment to eat out with Miranda.
d_counseling_n102_01_1,Teacher! Let's eat together!
d_counseling_n102_01_2,What are you in the mood for?
d_counseling_n102_01_3,Light croquettes.
d_counseling_n102_01_4,Spicy croquettes.
d_counseling_n102_01_5,I love those!
d_counseling_n102_01_6,I could eat them every day.
d_counseling_n102_01_7,Um... I can't really eat spicy food.
d_counseling_n102_01_8,"But, if you're there with me, it should be okay."
d_counseling_n102_01_9,I eat croquettes with N102.
d_counseling_n102_02_1,"Teacher, my head is killing me."
d_counseling_n102_02_2,It's throbbing...
d_counseling_n102_02_3,D-do you think there's something wrong with me?
d_counseling_n102_02_4,Let me take you to the hospital.
d_counseling_n102_02_5,Let me feel your forehead.
d_counseling_n102_02_6,H-hospital?
d_counseling_n102_02_7,I-I'm okay. I feel a lot better now.
d_counseling_n102_02_8,Hee hee...
d_counseling_n102_02_9,...
d_counseling_n102_02_10,It feels really nice when you touch my forehead. I feel better already.
d_counseling_n102_02_11,Thanks!
d_counseling_n102_02_12,I observe N102's condition for a while longer.
d_counseling_n102_03_1,"While I was on my way here, someone seemed to recognize me."
d_counseling_n102_03_2,"But, I'd never met them before! I have no memory of them."
d_counseling_n102_03_3,Do... do you think I did something wrong?
d_counseling_n102_03_4,No. I'm sure they were just mistaken.
d_counseling_n102_03_5,"If you see that person later, you should apologize."
d_counseling_n102_03_6,You think so?
d_counseling_n102_03_7,They seemed so happy to see me.
d_counseling_n102_03_8,"Well... if you say so, then I'm sure that's the case."
d_counseling_n102_03_9,"Yes, I will."
d_counseling_n102_03_10,But...
d_counseling_n102_03_11,I've already forgotten what they look like.
d_counseling_n102_03_12,I spend some quiet time together with N102.
d_counseling_n102_04_1,"Teacher, they've come out with jalapeño croquettes!"
d_counseling_n102_04_2,"I thought it was too spicy before, but I'm going to give it another try!"
d_counseling_n102_04_3,...?
d_counseling_n102_04_4,"Wait, have I ever tried jalapeño croquettes before?"
d_counseling_n102_04_5,We've had them together before.
d_counseling_n102_04_6,How could you have? They were only added to the menu today.
d_counseling_n102_04_7,R-really?
d_counseling_n102_04_8,I'm sorry. I can't seem to remember anything.
d_counseling_n102_04_9,N-next time I won't forget!
d_counseling_n102_04_10,I guess that makes sense...
d_counseling_n102_04_11,"Ha ha, maybe I dreamt about it because I was so excited!"
d_counseling_n102_04_12,Let's go!
d_counseling_n102_04_13,I spend time eating croquettes with N102.
d_counseling_n102_05_1,I want to go up to the surface as well.
d_counseling_n102_05_2,"All of that wide-open space, and the sky doesn't even crackle."
d_counseling_n102_05_3,And I want to see the ocean!
d_counseling_n102_05_4,Okay. Let's go together sometime soon.
d_counseling_n102_05_5,You went there yesterday.
d_counseling_n102_05_6,Okie-dokie!
d_counseling_n102_05_7,"But, I'll need a swimsuit to go into the ocean, won't I?"
d_counseling_n102_05_8,What kind of swimsuit do you think I should get?
d_counseling_n102_05_9,What?!
d_counseling_n102_05_10,"No way!
I've been underground ever since I was born!"
d_counseling_n102_05_11,"... Oh! Teacher!
You're just teasing me, aren't you?"
d_counseling_n102_05_12,I have a conversation with N102 about the surface.
d_counseling_n102_06_1,It's going to rain tomorrow!
d_counseling_n102_06_2,Don't forget your umbrella!
d_counseling_n102_06_3,"As for me, I'm gonna let myself get caught in the rain.
I've never been drenched by the rain before!"
d_counseling_n102_06_4,Getting wet is not a good feeling.
d_counseling_n102_06_5,You'll catch a cold.
d_counseling_n102_06_6,"Well, that's what you say."
d_counseling_n102_06_7,But I still want to see how it feels for myself.
d_counseling_n102_06_8,Ha ha! I'll be fine.
d_counseling_n102_06_9,Can I tell you a secret? I've never caught a cold before.
d_counseling_n102_06_10,"Come to think of it, I've never been sick, period! So, it'll be fine."
d_counseling_n102_06_11,I have a conversation with N102 about the weather.
d_counseling_n102_07_1,"Teacher, do I look like a celebrity or something?"
d_counseling_n102_07_2,All of these people seem to recognize me.
d_counseling_n102_07_3,"But, I've never seen them before in my life!"
d_counseling_n102_07_4,Maybe you've got an irresistible star quality to you.
d_counseling_n102_07_5,"Actually, you do resemble this one celebrity..."
d_counseling_n102_07_6,Um... Teacher... you shouldn't say stuff like that...
d_counseling_n102_07_7,It's a little... embarrassing.
d_counseling_n102_07_8,But... it makes me feel good at the same time! Hee hee.
d_counseling_n102_07_9,I do?
d_counseling_n102_07_10,Wow! I hope I get to meet them!
d_counseling_n102_07_11,I bet we'd surprise the heck out of each other!
d_counseling_n102_07_12,I have a conversation with N102 about TV shows.
d_counseling_n102_08_1,"Um...
Ummm..."
d_counseling_n102_08_2,"This show I'm watching has a male protagonist with amnesia, and he was getting mad at the female protagonist."
d_counseling_n102_08_3,I felt so bad for them both.
d_counseling_n102_08_4,That's a very sad story.
d_counseling_n102_08_5,What's so sad about it?
d_counseling_n102_08_6,That's how I felt.
d_counseling_n102_08_7,"If I ever got amnesia,"
d_counseling_n102_08_8,I don't know what I'd do.
d_counseling_n102_08_9,You really don't think it's sad?
d_counseling_n102_08_10,"No, because they're working together to rebuild what they lost."
d_counseling_n102_08_11,... Really?
d_counseling_n102_08_12,"I'm not sure why, but I think I get it. Kind of."
d_counseling_n102_08_13,I have a conversation with N102 about her favorite shows.
d_counseling_n102_09_1,"Teacher, have you ever been to Royal Road?"
d_counseling_n102_09_2,"I heard everything there is so shiny, and there's people all around."
d_counseling_n102_09_3,And they also have a croquette store!
d_counseling_n102_09_4,Do you want to go together?
d_counseling_n102_09_5,We go to that croquette store all the time.
d_counseling_n102_09_6,Sure!
d_counseling_n102_09_7,I love croquettes!
d_counseling_n102_09_8,I'm curious what flavors they have!
d_counseling_n102_09_9,Huh? What?
d_counseling_n102_09_10,"Teacher, you're not making any sense."
d_counseling_n102_09_11,I've never been to a croquette store with you.
d_counseling_n102_09_12,I go to the croquette store with N102.
d_counseling_n102_10_1,"Teacher, I just found out what a squad is."
d_counseling_n102_10_2,It's a group of teammates who work together on missions.
d_counseling_n102_10_3,Do you think I'll ever be part of a squad like that one day?
d_counseling_n102_10_4,It will happen someday.
d_counseling_n102_10_5,We already are a squad.
d_counseling_n102_10_6,Really?
d_counseling_n102_10_7,...
d_counseling_n102_10_8,Teammates... I'd like that.
d_counseling_n102_10_9,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_n102_10_10,"We're a squad, too!"
d_counseling_n102_10_11,"Hee hee. So, I already have teammates of my very own!"
d_counseling_n102_10_12,I explain our squad to N102 in detail.
d_counseling_n102_11_1,"Can I ask you, what kind of music do you like?"
d_counseling_n102_11_2,I'm utterly clueless when it comes to music.
d_counseling_n102_11_3,I'd love to hear your recommendations.
d_counseling_n102_11_4,Hum the tune for her.
d_counseling_n102_11_5,Simply say the title of the song.
d_counseling_n102_11_6,Wow...
d_counseling_n102_11_7,It's a beautiful song.
d_counseling_n102_11_8,You have a lovely singing voice as well.
d_counseling_n102_11_9,This is my new favorite song!
d_counseling_n102_11_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_n102_11_11,The title alone doesn't give me much to go on...
d_counseling_n102_11_12,"Either way, I'll give it a listen later!"
d_counseling_n102_11_13,N102 and I talk about our favorite songs.
d_counseling_n102_12_1,This is the first time we're really spoken one-on-one!
d_counseling_n102_12_2,"So, what are we supposed to talk about?"
d_counseling_n102_12_3,Anything you want.
d_counseling_n102_12_4,"If you're comfortable with it, you can share any concerns you have with me."
d_counseling_n102_12_5,Let me think...
d_counseling_n102_12_6,Anything at all?
d_counseling_n102_12_7,"All right, I'll tell you how my day went!"
d_counseling_n102_12_8,Hmm... Nothing's really on my mind right now...
d_counseling_n102_12_9,Should I be concerned about something?
d_counseling_n102_12_10,N102 and I have a wonderful time getting to know each other better.
d_counseling_n102_13_1,I'm dying to go play the claw machines.
d_counseling_n102_13_2,"Can I, teacher? Can I?"
d_counseling_n102_13_3,We'll go after we're done talking.
d_counseling_n102_13_4,"Let's finish talking first, then we'll see."
d_counseling_n102_13_5,Wow!
d_counseling_n102_13_6,You'll come with me?
d_counseling_n102_13_7,"All right then, let's hurry and get this over with!"
d_counseling_n102_13_8,Aw man... I can't afford to be late...
d_counseling_n102_13_9,Let's hurry and get this over with then!
d_counseling_n102_13_11,N102 and I have another meaningful conversation.
d_counseling_n102_14_1,I went to the library for the first time today.
d_counseling_n102_14_2,They said there was a book that was borrowed under my name!
d_counseling_n102_14_3,What could have happened?
d_counseling_n102_14_4,You must have borrowed a book once before.
d_counseling_n102_14_5,There's someone out there with the same name as you.
d_counseling_n102_14_6,Huh? Really?
d_counseling_n102_14_7,But today was my first time going to the library.
d_counseling_n102_14_8,There must have been some kind of mistake.
d_counseling_n102_14_9,Whoa!
d_counseling_n102_14_10,Someone with the same name as me!
d_counseling_n102_14_11,I'd like to meet them someday.
d_counseling_n102_14_12,N102 and I have a conversation about the library.
d_counseling_n102_15_1,"Teacher, I made a friend!"
d_counseling_n102_15_2,We agreed to have some ice cream together next time we meet.
d_counseling_n102_15_3,I can't wait!
d_counseling_n102_15_4,Which shop are you meeting at?
d_counseling_n102_15_5,Can I tag along?
d_counseling_n102_15_6,Hehe. It's a secret.
d_counseling_n102_15_7,My friend said it's a popular restaurant that's not easy to find.
d_counseling_n102_15_8,"I'll go scope it out and if it's delicious, I'll let you know."
d_counseling_n102_15_9,"Oh wow, I'd love it if you came with us!"
d_counseling_n102_15_10,I'm sure you'll get along with my friend as well.
d_counseling_n102_15_11,Just don't be late!
d_counseling_n102_15_12,I talk with N102 about our future plans.
d_counseling_n102_16_1,"Hi, nice to meet you!"
d_counseling_n102_16_2,Wait...
d_counseling_n102_16_3,This is strange.
d_counseling_n102_16_4,"I'm positive this is the first time we've met, but I feel like I've seen you somewhere before."
d_counseling_n102_16_5,Are you a celebrity or something?
d_counseling_n102_16_6,A-lister. I've even been on TV a few times.
d_counseling_n102_16_7,I'm afraid not.
d_counseling_n102_16_8,Really?
d_counseling_n102_16_9,"Wow, that's so cool! I've never met someone who was on TV before."
d_counseling_n102_16_10,You're not famous?
d_counseling_n102_16_11,Hmm... Then where have I seen you before?
d_counseling_n102_16_12,N102 and I reminisced about the times we had met in the past.
d_counseling_n102_17_1,"I saw a photo today of someone hanging out in the park, and they looked just like me!"
d_counseling_n102_17_2,"Which is crazy, because I've never been to the park before."
d_counseling_n102_17_3,They really were like a carbon copy of me.
d_counseling_n102_17_4,Didn't you go to the park with me before?
d_counseling_n102_17_5,That's very interesting.
d_counseling_n102_17_6,Are you sure? I'm almost positive I've never been...
d_counseling_n102_17_7,"Wait, that's it! Maybe you went with the person in that photo."
d_counseling_n102_17_8,"We look so similar, it's no surprise that you were fooled."
d_counseling_n102_17_9,I want to meet that person!
d_counseling_n102_17_10,"I know, right? Very interesting..."
d_counseling_n102_17_11,"Anyway, I'd really like to meet that person someday."
d_counseling_n102_17_12,How cool would it be to meet your doppelganger?
d_counseling_n102_17_13,I have a conversation with N102 about the mystery doppelganger.
d_counseling_n102_18_1,Teacher! People say that sometimes it's good to spend time reminiscing about past memories.
d_counseling_n102_18_2,But I... I don't have any to look back on.
d_counseling_n102_18_3,How can I build up more memories?
d_counseling_n102_18_4,Even now you're making future memories.
d_counseling_n102_18_5,Well...
d_counseling_n102_18_6,Even now?
d_counseling_n102_18_7,That's great!
d_counseling_n102_18_8,I've got memories now!
d_counseling_n102_18_9,"Teacher, why do you look so sad?"
d_counseling_n102_18_10,I don't need memories.
d_counseling_n102_18_11,So don't be sad.
d_counseling_n102_18_12,I made some new memories with N102.
d_counseling_n102_19_1,"Say, do you have any secrets?"
d_counseling_n102_19_2,"If you do, can you tell me about it and no one else?"
d_counseling_n102_19_3,"Actually, I forget old memories every day."
d_counseling_n102_19_4,"Actually, I can't eat hot croquettes because they're too spicy."
d_counseling_n102_19_5,Huh? What are you saying?
d_counseling_n102_19_6,"That's not a secret, that's just a big ol' fib!"
d_counseling_n102_19_7,Tell me a real secret.
d_counseling_n102_19_8,You mean you can't eat anything spicy either?
d_counseling_n102_19_9,Neither can I!
d_counseling_n102_19_10,"All right, your secret is safe with me!"
d_counseling_n102_19_11,N102 and I share some of our secrets with one another.
d_counseling_n102_20_1,Teacher! I woke up and I had chocolates in my pocket!
d_counseling_n102_20_2,But I never brought any chocolates.
d_counseling_n102_20_3,Who do you think gave them to me?
d_counseling_n102_20_4,Maybe you slept in someone else's clothing?
d_counseling_n102_20_5,Aren't those the chocolates I gave you yesterday?
d_counseling_n102_20_6,Someone else's clothes?
d_counseling_n102_20_7,"Hey, you may be onto something! I think this is the first time I've worn these clothes."
d_counseling_n102_20_8,I must have slept in someone else's clothes by mistake.
d_counseling_n102_20_9,"Ha, nice try!"
d_counseling_n102_20_10,I'm not falling for that one.
d_counseling_n102_20_11,Today is the first day we've met.
d_counseling_n102_20_12,I share the chocolate with N102.
d_counseling_neon_01_1,Master.
d_counseling_neon_01_2,Why are gunpowder sparks so beautiful?
d_counseling_neon_01_3,Because that's their purpose.
d_counseling_neon_01_4,"They're not as beautiful as you, Neon."
d_counseling_neon_01_5,"Really? I think so, too."
d_counseling_neon_01_6,Having beautiful explosions as your entire purpose... isn't it wonderful?
d_counseling_neon_01_7,...
d_counseling_neon_01_8,Are you even listening to me?
d_counseling_neon_01_9,Neon educates me about the pyrotechnic reactions occurring from gunpowder.
d_counseling_neon_02_1,Master! I'm in trouble!
d_counseling_neon_02_2,"They're selling a limited-edition cartridge case in 30 minutes, and I'm broke!"
d_counseling_neon_02_3,Let me borrow some money!
d_counseling_neon_02_4,No.
d_counseling_neon_02_5,Are you sure this isn't just an impulse buy?
d_counseling_neon_02_6,*Sigh* I knew you would see right through me.
d_counseling_neon_02_7,I already blew through my entire paycheck!
d_counseling_neon_02_8,"Well, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I've bought that cartridge case before, anyway."
d_counseling_neon_02_9,"But then again, it would be nice having two of them..."
d_counseling_neon_02_10,"... No, it's not worth putting myself in debt."
d_counseling_neon_02_11,I spend time hearing about Neon's love for bullet casings.
d_counseling_neon_03_1,"Master, which is better?"
d_counseling_neon_03_2,"One large-caliber bullet,"
d_counseling_neon_03_3,or several small-caliber bullets?
d_counseling_neon_03_4,One large-caliber bullet.
d_counseling_neon_03_5,Several small-caliber bullets.
d_counseling_neon_03_6,I knew you'd give an answer that breaks the mold.
d_counseling_neon_03_7,I respect that. That's why you have my eternal loyalty.
d_counseling_neon_03_8,Wow.
d_counseling_neon_03_9,"You think so small, Master."
d_counseling_neon_03_10,I get subjected to a lecture from Neon about the different bullet calibers.
d_counseling_neon_04_1,Firepower.
d_counseling_neon_04_2,Firepower! Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_04_3,Firepower! Firepower! Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_04_4,... Get a hold of yourself.
d_counseling_neon_04_5,Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_04_6,...
d_counseling_neon_04_7,Firepower...
d_counseling_neon_04_8,Firepower! Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_04_9,Firepower! Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_04_10,"Neon and I continue shouting ""Firepower!"""
d_counseling_neon_05_1,Why is Rapi so serious all the time?
d_counseling_neon_05_2,Doesn't it wear her out?
d_counseling_neon_05_3,Being super animated all day long would be just as tiring.
d_counseling_neon_05_4,Someone has to take things seriously around here.
d_counseling_neon_05_5,That's what you think.
d_counseling_neon_05_6,"As for me, I always keep on the sunny side of life."
d_counseling_neon_05_7,Oh... well...
d_counseling_neon_05_8,"Yes, I understand."
d_counseling_neon_05_9,I have a conversation with Neon about personalities.
d_counseling_neon_06_1,Master.
d_counseling_neon_06_2,Anis stole my snack.
d_counseling_neon_06_3,All of this rage boiling up inside me... I've got to let it out somehow!
d_counseling_neon_06_4,Let's go shoot some guns outside.
d_counseling_neon_06_5,Go give Anis a piece of your mind.
d_counseling_neon_06_6,What an incredible idea!
d_counseling_neon_06_7,That'll help me vent for sure!
d_counseling_neon_06_8,I can't do that!
d_counseling_neon_06_9,"Before Anis stole my snacks, I stole hers!"
d_counseling_neon_06_10,I discuss anger management with Neon.
d_counseling_neon_07_1,Rapi really laid into me.
d_counseling_neon_07_2,"She said Anis already makes the dorm plenty messy, so she doesn't need me messing it up any further."
d_counseling_neon_07_3,"Why does Anis get a pass and not me?
Why?!"
d_counseling_neon_07_4,"From now on, you get to mess up the dorm, too."
d_counseling_neon_07_5,... No one should be allowed to mess up the dorm.
d_counseling_neon_07_6,"Wow! Incredible! Amazing!
I'm gonna really cut loose!"
d_counseling_neon_07_7,"... but if I do that, Rapi will really let me have it."
d_counseling_neon_07_8,"You always know the right thing to say, Master."
d_counseling_neon_07_9,I teach Neon how to keep the dorm clean.
d_counseling_neon_08_1,"Master, something's wrong with the shower."
d_counseling_neon_08_2,It's not working. I have no idea why.
d_counseling_neon_08_3,How can it do this to me? Doesn't it understand how this makes me feel?!
d_counseling_neon_08_4,Pull your gun on it.
d_counseling_neon_08_5,Open your heart and plead with it.
d_counseling_neon_08_6,"Hey, that's right!"
d_counseling_neon_08_7,"My gun is how I express myself!
You're saying I just need to open up more!"
d_counseling_neon_08_8,"From now on, whenever I'm asking for a favor, I'll pull out my gun for emphasis!"
d_counseling_neon_08_9,No.
d_counseling_neon_08_10,"If I end up getting rejected, that'll only hurt my feelings even more."
d_counseling_neon_08_11,What an idiot I am! I'm so pathetic!
d_counseling_neon_08_12,I listen to more of Neon's serious concerns about the shower.
d_counseling_neon_09_1,Rapi brought some cookies back from the Ark.
d_counseling_neon_09_2,She gave them to me and told me to share them with Anis.
d_counseling_neon_09_3,But... I don't want to.
d_counseling_neon_09_4,Sharing is caring.
d_counseling_neon_09_5,Let's eat them together. Our little secret.
d_counseling_neon_09_6,Anis just snatches them so hard she crushes them in her hands!
d_counseling_neon_09_7,It's so undignified!
d_counseling_neon_09_8,Not like me. I only touch them with my fingertips!
d_counseling_neon_09_9,... Really?
d_counseling_neon_09_10,"Hm... once they're in our stomachs, no one will know."
d_counseling_neon_09_11,It's the perfect crime!
d_counseling_neon_09_12,I tell Neon about some famous restaurants in the Ark.
d_counseling_neon_10_1,I had a scary dream.
d_counseling_neon_10_2,A cartridge casing got jammed and my gun wouldn't fire!
d_counseling_neon_10_3,What if that happened in real life? I wouldn't be able to shoot!!
d_counseling_neon_10_4,There is something called an emergency reload for situations like that.
d_counseling_neon_10_5,Just carry multiple guns.
d_counseling_neon_10_6,"Right, emergency reload. Very tactical."
d_counseling_neon_10_8,I need to find the boss.
d_counseling_neon_10_9,But a gun is like a lover.
d_counseling_neon_10_10,I can only love one!
d_counseling_neon_10_11,I'm no two-timing hussy!
d_counseling_neon_10_12,I study weapon malfunctions with Neon.
d_counseling_neon_11_1,"Hey, if you could go 10 years into the future and"
d_counseling_neon_11_2,"bring back just one thing, what would it be?"
d_counseling_neon_11_3,An ultra-high-tech firearm.
d_counseling_neon_11_4,The badge of rank.
d_counseling_neon_11_5,"Since it's the future, there'd be a smorgasbord of cool things to choose from."
d_counseling_neon_11_6,Yet you chose firearms without any hesitation.
d_counseling_neon_11_7,I knew there was a reason I respect you!
d_counseling_neon_11_8,...
d_counseling_neon_11_9,"I guess you must have a hard time, right?"
d_counseling_neon_11_10,Neon and I have fun running through other hypotheticals.
d_counseling_neon_12_1,"Master, what is your goal for this year?"
d_counseling_neon_12_2,"If I like the sound of it, I may set the same goal for myself."
d_counseling_neon_12_3,Upgrade my firepower three times over.
d_counseling_neon_12_4,Upgrade my speed three times over.
d_counseling_neon_12_5,"Hmm, that's the same goal I had as of last year..."
d_counseling_neon_12_6,"But then again, why fix what isn't broken?"
d_counseling_neon_12_7,You mean three times your current speed?
d_counseling_neon_12_8,"That's all well and good, but then we could end up being outgunned by the Rapture's new high-performance weaponry."
d_counseling_neon_12_9,I'll keep focusing on increasing my firepower.
d_counseling_neon_12_10,Neon and I put our heads together and set our goals for the new year.
d_counseling_neon_13_1,Have you heard about the ghost story involving the fridge in our dorm?
d_counseling_neon_13_2,"Once a week, on the third shelf from the bottom of the fridge..."
d_counseling_neon_13_3,Some truly ghastly food mysteriously appears. People say it's made by dead Nikkes seeking revenge on the living.
d_counseling_neon_13_4,Are you sure they're not just butchered recipes?
d_counseling_neon_13_5,Have you tried any of them?
d_counseling_neon_13_6,"If you're so confident, you should try some."
d_counseling_neon_13_7,"I assure you, evil lurks within those foul food fiascos."
d_counseling_neon_13_8,...
d_counseling_neon_13_9,"Yes... for everyone's safety, of course."
d_counseling_neon_13_10,"But from now on, I'll never do it again."
d_counseling_neon_13_11,Neon shares more Outpost-related ghost stories with me.
d_counseling_neon_14_1,Do you think there are elevators that can teleport?
d_counseling_neon_14_2,I don't like waiting to go up and down to and from the surface.
d_counseling_neon_14_3,You could always spend that time waiting with someone you like.
d_counseling_neon_14_4,You could cut the elevator cables.
d_counseling_neon_14_5,...!!
d_counseling_neon_14_6,Good point! Then time would pass more quickly!
d_counseling_neon_14_7,"All right then, next time I'll stay close to you."
d_counseling_neon_14_8,"Let me guess, then let gravity do the rest?"
d_counseling_neon_14_9,I'd plummet to the ground about as quickly as teleporting would get me there.
d_counseling_neon_14_10,"Then I can become a ghost and float my way back up, is that it?"
d_counseling_neon_14_11,Neon and I racked our brains trying to come up with ways to save time waiting for the elevator.
d_counseling_neon_15_1,"I was sitting on the sofa, watching TV in your room."
d_counseling_neon_15_2,"I had clearly been there first, but then Anis barged in and told me to move!"
d_counseling_neon_15_3,Don't you think that's unfair?
d_counseling_neon_15_4,I would say so.
d_counseling_neon_15_5,What are the two of you doing in someone else's room?
d_counseling_neon_15_6,Right? Right?
d_counseling_neon_15_7,I knew you would see things my way.
d_counseling_neon_15_8,"Aw come on, how can you talk like that?"
d_counseling_neon_15_9,It's hard hearing that from a fellow firepower aficionado.
d_counseling_neon_15_10,"In my spare time, I helped settle the great sofa dispute."
d_counseling_neon_16_1,I have a question.
d_counseling_neon_16_2,"Where do you think I can find the fabled blacksmith of legend, who can craft a legendary firearm for me?"
d_counseling_neon_16_3,Inside your own heart
d_counseling_neon_16_4,"This so-called ""legendary blacksmith"" is simply the fire and brimstone in your heart."
d_counseling_neon_16_5,"No way, the only thing my heart is filled with is fire and brimstone!"
d_counseling_neon_16_6,Did my question rub you the wrong way?
d_counseling_neon_16_7,"Otherwise, why would you give me that kind of answer..."
d_counseling_neon_16_8,You mean to say...
d_counseling_neon_16_9,All that fire and brimstone are the key to creating the legendary firearm?
d_counseling_neon_16_10,"I can't thank you enough, Master. You always guide me to the right path."
d_counseling_neon_16_11,"If you'd just said to look inside my own heart and nothing more, I'd have thought you were brushing me off!"
d_counseling_neon_16_12,"Neon and I talk about the so-called ""legendary blacksmith"""
d_counseling_neon_17_1,"Master, I want to ask you a serious question."
d_counseling_neon_17_2,"What would you be more afraid of: running out of bullets, or food?"
d_counseling_neon_17_3,Food.
d_counseling_neon_17_4,Bullets.
d_counseling_neon_17_5,What?! How can you say that?
d_counseling_neon_17_6,"As a die-hard proponent of all things weaponry, I thought for sure you'd say bullets."
d_counseling_neon_17_7,"Off in the distance, I can hear the muffled sound of Anis cheering wildly."
d_counseling_neon_17_8,Sigh... I made a bet with Anis. I thought you saying bullets was a done deal... guess I lost.
d_counseling_neon_17_9,Too right!
d_counseling_neon_17_10,"Off in the distance, I can hear the muffled sound of Anis' frustrated screams."
d_counseling_neon_17_11,"I made a bet with Anis. I said you would go for bullets, and I was right!"
d_counseling_neon_17_12,Watched Neon and Anis settle their bets.
d_counseling_neon_18_1,"In your mind, what is the pinnacle of firepower?"
d_counseling_neon_18_2,A power that can bring order to chaos.
d_counseling_neon_18_3,Such a thing does not exist.
d_counseling_neon_18_4,Chaos??
d_counseling_neon_18_5,I think you're hanging around with Guillotine too much.
d_counseling_neon_18_6,You're starting to sound like a bad young adult novel.
d_counseling_neon_18_7,... Of course.
d_counseling_neon_18_8,"Firepower is a mountain. The moment you believe there is a summit, you instantly hamstring yourself."
d_counseling_neon_18_9,"You're right. For firepower, there is no top of the mountain!"
d_counseling_neon_18_10,"Neon and I continue to discuss the limits of firepower, and if such a thing truly exists."
d_counseling_neon_19_1,Master! Something terrible has happened!
d_counseling_neon_19_2,Emma's taken over the kitchen and started cooking!
d_counseling_neon_19_3,... Just accept it.
d_counseling_neon_19_4,I'll try and lure her outside by telling her I'll taste her food.
d_counseling_neon_19_5,!!
d_counseling_neon_19_6,"But if I do that, may the heavens look over my poor digestive tract..."
d_counseling_neon_19_7,"Please, we can't give up so soon!"
d_counseling_neon_19_8,"But if you do that, you'll be putting your stomach directly in the line of fire!"
d_counseling_neon_19_9,It's a sacrifice someone has to make.
d_counseling_neon_19_10,!!
d_counseling_neon_19_11,I will not forget your sacrifice.
d_counseling_neon_19_12,I go to see Emma in the kitchen.
d_counseling_neon_20_1,"Out of curiosity,"
d_counseling_neon_20_2,"if you had to interact with one of the CEOs of the Big Three,"
d_counseling_neon_20_3,who would it be?
d_counseling_neon_20_4,Mustang.
d_counseling_neon_20_5,Ingrid.
d_counseling_neon_20_6,That's entertainment!
d_counseling_neon_20_7,"The last time I saw you with him, you seemed awfully uncomfortable."
d_counseling_neon_20_8,Perhaps you don't find him so bad after all?
d_counseling_neon_20_9,Very wise choice!
d_counseling_neon_20_10,"Our CEO is the best, there's no doubt about that!"
d_counseling_neon_20_11,Preach!
d_counseling_neon_20_12,Neon and I compare and contrast The Big Three CEOs.
d_counseling_noah_01_1,Ha!
d_counseling_noah_01_2,Hehe...
d_counseling_noah_01_3,Why are you laughing?
d_counseling_noah_01_4,Laugh with her.
d_counseling_noah_01_5,"Oh, nothing."
d_counseling_noah_01_6,I just find it funny that a lowly Imposter like you is trying to give me advice.
d_counseling_noah_01_7,... Hey...
d_counseling_noah_01_8,Do you even know why I'm laughing?
d_counseling_noah_01_9,I have a battle of wits with Noah.
d_counseling_noah_02_1,Everyone from Eden just does whatever they want.
d_counseling_noah_02_2,Harran acts like she's the only person in the whole world.
d_counseling_noah_02_3,And Isabel... she's got a few screws loose.
d_counseling_noah_02_4,What can I do to make myself even worse than them?
d_counseling_noah_02_5,What an oddball question.
d_counseling_noah_02_6,Just keep doing what you're doing.
d_counseling_noah_02_7,What? Why?
d_counseling_noah_02_8,It's a perfectly normal question.
d_counseling_noah_02_9,Hm... so you mean to say that I'm already doing a good job?
d_counseling_noah_02_10,"In your eyes, at least?"
d_counseling_noah_02_11,Excellent. I'll start with what I've got and turn it up a notch.
d_counseling_noah_02_12,I have a conversation with Noah without any semblance of common sense.
d_counseling_noah_03_1,"Tell me, Imposter. How is a weakling like you even alive?"
d_counseling_noah_03_2,You're nothing like a real Commander.
d_counseling_noah_03_3,"A real Commander stands strong, even in the face of Raptures."
d_counseling_noah_03_4,It all comes down to having different equipment.
d_counseling_noah_03_5,It's not necessarily the commander's duty to be strong.
d_counseling_noah_03_6,"Equipment is an important factor, yes."
d_counseling_noah_03_7,"But let's be honest, isn't obtaining proper equipment a skill in its own right? Hee hee!"
d_counseling_noah_03_8,"Ugh, what are you even doing here?"
d_counseling_noah_03_9,Next time I'll ask the real Commander.
d_counseling_noah_03_10,I have a back and forth repartee with Noah.
d_counseling_noah_04_1,I don't understand the Ark.
d_counseling_noah_04_2,"In Eden, we do not tolerate weakness in any form."
d_counseling_noah_04_3,"But here, it's the complete opposite."
d_counseling_noah_04_4,Why do the strong allow themselves to be held back by the inferior?
d_counseling_noah_04_5,Why do they not simply leave them behind?
d_counseling_noah_04_6,The weak also have roles to play.
d_counseling_noah_04_7,The strong have a duty to protect the weak.
d_counseling_noah_04_8,Like selling clothes or making food?
d_counseling_noah_04_9,"Boring things like that, right?"
d_counseling_noah_04_10,... Duty?
d_counseling_noah_04_11,I don't understand. It's not my duty to save others.
d_counseling_noah_04_12,... Hm.
d_counseling_noah_04_13,Noah is deep in thought.
d_counseling_noah_05_1,The food in the Ark is simply grotesque.
d_counseling_noah_05_2,Meat-flavored Splendamin instead of real meat.
d_counseling_noah_05_3,Apple-flavored Splendamin instead of real apples.
d_counseling_noah_05_4,Why is it like that? It's enough to make my stomach churn.
d_counseling_noah_05_5,Because of food shortages.
d_counseling_noah_05_6,"Surprisingly, it's highly nutritious."
d_counseling_noah_05_7,Well...
d_counseling_noah_05_8,You really should have seen that coming.
d_counseling_noah_05_9,Did you really expect to live in a hole and still have anything to eat?
d_counseling_noah_05_10,I see.
d_counseling_noah_05_11,That may be so...
d_counseling_noah_05_12,"But, considering how foul it tastes, is it really worth it?"
d_counseling_noah_05_13,I talk with Noah about Splendamin.
d_counseling_noah_06_1,Uh-oh! I'm in trouble.
d_counseling_noah_06_2,Isabel found out I used to bully you.
d_counseling_noah_06_3,So what?
d_counseling_noah_06_4,Best of luck to you.
d_counseling_noah_06_5,What do you mean 'so what'?!
d_counseling_noah_06_6,We must fight to the death!
d_counseling_noah_06_7,"Or, at least we'll fight until the real commander puts a stop to it."
d_counseling_noah_06_8,Ugh...
d_counseling_noah_06_9,This is driving me crazy.
d_counseling_noah_06_11,I listen to Noah's concerns about human relationships.
d_counseling_noah_07_1,I saw something new while I was walking down the road yesterday.
d_counseling_noah_07_2,What is an Ark Ranger?
d_counseling_noah_07_3,It's a hit show that plays inside the Ark.
d_counseling_noah_07_4,It's a story of 5 masked heroes who vow to crush the Raptures.
d_counseling_noah_07_5,A hit show? What is that?
d_counseling_noah_07_6,Explain it in a way I can understand.
d_counseling_noah_07_7,What!?
d_counseling_noah_07_8,... Hm.
d_counseling_noah_07_9,"Not bad. Not bad.
Where can I see it?"
d_counseling_noah_07_10,I tell Noah all about the Ark Rangers.
d_counseling_noah_08_1,"Hey, Imposter."
d_counseling_noah_08_2,"I'm only asking because I'm curious, but..."
d_counseling_noah_08_3,Why do you take care of me even though I bully you all the time?
d_counseling_noah_08_4,Cause I love... to hate you.
d_counseling_noah_08_5,You're like a little sister to me. I can't hate you.
d_counseling_noah_08_6,!?
d_counseling_noah_08_7,"Hey, you're not actually upset, are you?"
d_counseling_noah_08_8,A little sister?
d_counseling_noah_08_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_noah_08_10,Wait a minute...
d_counseling_noah_08_11,Are you even older than me?
d_counseling_noah_08_12,How can that be?! You're so puny!
d_counseling_noah_08_13,I have a heartfelt conversation with Noah.
d_counseling_noah_09_1,I found one hell of a shield up on the surface!
d_counseling_noah_09_2,Hyyaaah!
d_counseling_noah_09_3,What the heck are you doing?
d_counseling_noah_09_4,"Hey, that hurts."
d_counseling_noah_09_5,"Oh? What'd you say, you big bully?"
d_counseling_noah_09_6,Are you getting angry?
d_counseling_noah_09_7,I'm not angry.
d_counseling_noah_09_8,Hyyaaah!
d_counseling_noah_09_9,*Smack*
d_counseling_noah_09_10,How about now?
d_counseling_noah_09_11,Still not angry.
d_counseling_noah_09_12,Really? Impressive.
d_counseling_noah_09_13,Pssh! Please.
d_counseling_noah_09_14,I barely hit you...
d_counseling_noah_09_15,It's my heart that hurts.
d_counseling_noah_09_16,"I have nothing better to do, so I mess around with Noah."
d_counseling_noah_10_1,"When I went to visit the Outpost today,"
d_counseling_noah_10_2,I saw something very fluffy.
d_counseling_noah_10_3,Do you think I can touch it?
d_counseling_noah_10_4,Are you talking about Poli?
d_counseling_noah_10_5,??
d_counseling_noah_10_6,Her name is Poli?
d_counseling_noah_10_7,... I'll try and touch her next time.
d_counseling_noah_10_8,It was white! And small!
d_counseling_noah_10_9,And fluffy!
d_counseling_noah_10_10,"It was making weird noises as it walked around, too."
d_counseling_noah_10_11,I have a normal conversation with Noah.
d_counseling_noah_11_1,*Swoosh* *Shhhwoosh* *Shhhwoosh*
d_counseling_noah_11_2,Noah is busy shadowboxing.
d_counseling_noah_11_3,Oh... it's you.
d_counseling_noah_11_4,"If you think I'm actually gonna sit down and talk to you, you've got another thing coming."
d_counseling_noah_11_5,... We can talk another day then.
d_counseling_noah_11_6,Stand up to her.
d_counseling_noah_11_7,Huh? Giving up so easily?
d_counseling_noah_11_8,Aren't you supposed to be a Commander?
d_counseling_noah_11_9,"The moment you encounter some resistance, you just give up! I can't believe it!"
d_counseling_noah_11_10,"So you want to fight me, is that it? Well, take THIS!"
d_counseling_noah_11_11,"Noah lands a blow, and I start seeing stars."
d_counseling_noah_11_12,I drop like a sack of potatoes.
d_counseling_noah_11_13,...!?
d_counseling_noah_11_14,"Wait, what?! I knew you were weak, but I didn't actually think you'd..."
d_counseling_noah_11_15,My session with Noah ended prematurely.
d_counseling_noah_12_1,Tada~
d_counseling_noah_12_2,Noah hands me a small bottle.
d_counseling_noah_12_3,Take a guess what this is.
d_counseling_noah_12_4,Perfume?
d_counseling_noah_12_5,Harran's perfume?
d_counseling_noah_12_6,Nope.
d_counseling_noah_12_7,"Even though you got it wrong, I'll still give it to you."
d_counseling_noah_12_8,"Wow, your intuition is on par with a Pilgrim."
d_counseling_noah_12_9,"Here. As your reward, it's yours."
d_counseling_noah_12_10,"Harran and I got into a little scuffle, and I swiped this from her."
d_counseling_noah_12_11,I'm sure the owner will be coming to retrieve it shortly. Tata now!
d_counseling_noah_12_12,"After handing me Harran's perfume, Noah scurries away."
d_counseling_noah_13_1,Let me ask you something.
d_counseling_noah_13_2,Do you think there's a limit to how strong someone can get?
d_counseling_noah_13_3,I don't think so.
d_counseling_noah_13_4,I believe so.
d_counseling_noah_13_5,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_noah_13_6,But a part of me finds all of this quite tiresome.
d_counseling_noah_13_7,"Since there's no limit, I can't have a moment's rest, no matter how strong I get."
d_counseling_noah_13_8,...
d_counseling_noah_13_9,"You moron, of course there's no such thing."
d_counseling_noah_13_10,"If you defeat a formidable foe, a stronger one will come along and take its place. That is how it works."
d_counseling_noah_13_11,Noah and I talk about the upper limits of strength.
d_counseling_noah_14_1,"I thought about it from every angle, and I have gotta say: I like my squad."
d_counseling_noah_14_2,Can you guess why?
d_counseling_noah_14_3,Because they're as strong as you are.
d_counseling_noah_14_4,Because all of you work well together.
d_counseling_noah_14_5,Good guess!
d_counseling_noah_14_6,A strong shield can only work when paired with a spear that flies fair and true.
d_counseling_noah_14_7,You... what...
d_counseling_noah_14_8,How can someone... have such poor judgment?
d_counseling_noah_14_9,And to think you call yourself a Commander...
d_counseling_noah_14_10,I have a conversation with Noah about the other members of the Inherit Squad.
d_counseling_noah_15_1,"When I was watching TV in your room today,"
d_counseling_noah_15_2,seeing a Nikke flying around with a skateboard.
d_counseling_noah_15_3,"... If I use my shield, do you think I can do the same?"
d_counseling_noah_15_4,You can learn from her.
d_counseling_noah_15_5,I will just get you a skateboard.
d_counseling_noah_15_6,What? From her?
d_counseling_noah_15_7,You mean... the person on tv?
d_counseling_noah_15_8,"Wow, wait. You think she will really come?"
d_counseling_noah_15_9,Forget it... I don't want to carry around a burdensome thing like that on the surface.
d_counseling_noah_15_10,I'd rather rip apart a Rapture and ride its pieces.
d_counseling_noah_15_11,You know that iron plate-looking thing attached to the exoskeleton? That round thing.
d_counseling_noah_15_12,I do a plan with Noah about the skateboard.
d_counseling_noah_16_1,You've got 10 seconds.
d_counseling_noah_16_2,"You can order me to do anything, and I'll do it."
d_counseling_noah_16_3,You have to meow at the end of every sentence.
d_counseling_noah_16_4,Transform into your final form.
d_counseling_noah_16_5,"Oh, for crying out... can't you go a little easy on me?"
d_counseling_noah_16_6,Is this really how a Commander should be behaving?
d_counseling_noah_16_7,Whether I transform or not is of no importance.
d_counseling_noah_16_8,I am a Pilgrim. I have always been whole.
d_counseling_noah_16_9,"All right, your 10 seconds are up. Now it's my turn."
d_counseling_noah_16_10,I go ahead and indulge Noah in playing a goofy game.
d_counseling_noah_17_1,I really don't like those Pioneer guys.
d_counseling_noah_17_2,"They're always going on about how they must protect humans, how everything is for mankind's benefit... blah, blah, blah..."
d_counseling_noah_17_3,When have humans ever done anything for us?
d_counseling_noah_17_4,"As long as you continue walking your own path, you'll be fine."
d_counseling_noah_17_5,True belief is greater than petty things like personal gain.
d_counseling_noah_17_6,"Trust me, I was planning on it."
d_counseling_noah_17_7,...
d_counseling_noah_17_8,"But, just so you know, I don't mean to say I've never received anything from you."
d_counseling_noah_17_9,"Yeah yeah, but do beliefs put food on the table?"
d_counseling_noah_17_10,"Seems like it's the opposite to me. Just look at Snow White, she's always going hungry."
d_counseling_noah_17_11,"Anyway, all I'm saying is that we should all learn to live on our own."
d_counseling_noah_17_12,I have a conversation with Noah about Pilgrims who are on different paths.
d_counseling_noah_18_1,Hey. Hellooooo...
d_counseling_noah_18_2,Have you ever dozed off during a battle?
d_counseling_noah_18_3,How is that even possible?
d_counseling_noah_18_4,You mean you have before?
d_counseling_noah_18_5,Sure it is. Just because you haven't experienced it yourself doesn't mean it's not possible.
d_counseling_noah_18_6,For example...
d_counseling_noah_18_7,"A throng of enemies appears. I deploy my shield, and I take a cat nap for a few minutes. The end."
d_counseling_noah_18_8,That's all there is to it.
d_counseling_noah_18_9,Do I have to spell it out for you?
d_counseling_noah_18_10,"Once you get as strong as I have,"
d_counseling_noah_18_11,you can decimate your enemies even while you're asleep.
d_counseling_noah_18_12,I listen patiently as Noah bragged about her prowess in battle.
d_counseling_noah_19_1,You see these horns on my head?
d_counseling_noah_19_2,All of our squad members have them.
d_counseling_noah_19_3,"Guess what we use them for. If you get it right, I won't bug you anymore today."
d_counseling_noah_19_4,They're used as a high-tech communication device.
d_counseling_noah_19_5,They're just for decoration.
d_counseling_noah_19_6,What?! How did you know?
d_counseling_noah_19_7,"You're not some kind of spy, are you?"
d_counseling_noah_19_8,"... Ahem... Anyway, there's more to it than that."
d_counseling_noah_19_9,What?!
d_counseling_noah_19_10,"I mean, sure... they may look nice..."
d_counseling_noah_19_11,"but they're meant to serve another purpose, which is..."
d_counseling_noah_19_12,I listen as Noah unveiled the secret purpose of the Inherit Squad members' horns.
d_counseling_noah_20_1,Your body is so fragile compared to a Nikke's.
d_counseling_noah_20_2,Have you ever thought about swapping it for a mechanical body?
d_counseling_noah_20_3,I want to become strong while remaining a human.
d_counseling_noah_20_4,I'm not opposed to the idea.
d_counseling_noah_20_5,"Huh? So to you, if your body is mechanical, that means you're no longer human?"
d_counseling_noah_20_6,Then the real Commander is a monst...
d_counseling_noah_20_7,... Oh. That actually makes sense.
d_counseling_noah_20_8,"Wow. For such a puny little creature, you certainly are determined."
d_counseling_noah_20_9,"Very good. Well then, shall we head up to the surface and gather some parts?"
d_counseling_noah_20_10,Wait for a second...
d_counseling_noah_20_11,"Now that I think about it... If you get stronger, then I wouldn't be able to keep making fun of you."
d_counseling_noah_20_12,I have a conversation with Noah about strengthening the body.
d_counseling_novel_01_1,Watson! We have a problem...
d_counseling_novel_01_2,"I recently accepted a case,"
d_counseling_novel_01_3,but my detective senses just aren't coming to me.
d_counseling_novel_01_4,Why not do a rain dance?
d_counseling_novel_01_5,Try going to the scene of the crime.
d_counseling_novel_01_6,W-Watson...
d_counseling_novel_01_7,I don't think you know what rain dances are for... Let me explain it to you.
d_counseling_novel_01_8,You do a rain dance to make it rain...
d_counseling_novel_01_9,Just kidding.
d_counseling_novel_01_10,I'm actually on my way back from the crime scene...
d_counseling_novel_01_11,"But maybe if I took you, I would notice something else."
d_counseling_novel_01_12,Let's go there right away! Carriage!
d_counseling_novel_01_13,I spend time talking with Novel about a case.
d_counseling_novel_02_1,I have a serious problem.
d_counseling_novel_02_2,For today's lunch...
d_counseling_novel_02_3,Should I have pizza-flavored Splendamin or the chicken-flavored Splendamin?
d_counseling_novel_02_4,"Of course, pizza. Pizza is life."
d_counseling_novel_02_5,"If you are a citizen of the Ark, chicken is best."
d_counseling_novel_02_6,Beep beep beep beep beep!!
d_counseling_novel_02_7,My detective sense just went off!
d_counseling_novel_02_8,I'll choose the opposite of Watson's recommendation.
d_counseling_novel_02_10,"Yeah, well."
d_counseling_novel_02_11,"To be honest, I don't think it was worth getting worried about in the first place."
d_counseling_novel_02_12,Turns out she'd already decided even before I answered.
d_counseling_novel_03_1,With Exia's knack for obtaining information...
d_counseling_novel_03_2,and my unbelievably accurate analyses...
d_counseling_novel_03_3,Protocol should be the best squad in the Ark!
d_counseling_novel_03_4,"So, why isn't that the case?"
d_counseling_novel_03_5,Who said it's not?
d_counseling_novel_03_6,Because your squad's talents aren't all about firepower.
d_counseling_novel_03_7,When I asked people on the street who the strongest squad was...
d_counseling_novel_03_8,... approximately 95% replied Matis or Absolute.
d_counseling_novel_03_9,"With results like that, I can't even claim a mental victory..."
d_counseling_novel_03_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_novel_03_11,That makes sense.
d_counseling_novel_03_12,The pen is mightier than the sword. Hahaha!
d_counseling_novel_03_13,"I comfort Novel, who is down in the dumps about her squad's ranking."
d_counseling_novel_04_1,Watson.
d_counseling_novel_04_2,I'd like to try out this new add-on I got for my watch.
d_counseling_novel_04_3,"Can you help me, as my assistant?"
d_counseling_novel_04_4,Of course.
d_counseling_novel_04_5,(Make a run for it.)
d_counseling_novel_04_6,You agreed!
d_counseling_novel_04_7,Hey! Where are you running off to?
d_counseling_novel_04_8,*Whoosh* *Zap*
d_counseling_novel_04_9,"All of a sudden, my mind starts to become blurry."
d_counseling_novel_04_10,"Haha... Sedating Watson, success!"
d_counseling_novel_04_11,"In the future, when necessary, I will pretend to be you and give myself excellent performance reviews..."
d_counseling_novel_04_12,I was unconscious for the entire discussion.
d_counseling_novel_05_1,I need to send a text message to a client.
d_counseling_novel_05_2,"But, I just can't seem to get it right! What should I do?"
d_counseling_novel_05_3,I'll send it for you.
d_counseling_novel_05_4,You just have to keep practicing.
d_counseling_novel_05_5,R-really?
d_counseling_novel_05_6,"Watson, you are really..."
d_counseling_novel_05_7,... on the road to becoming the perfect assistant!
d_counseling_novel_05_8,*Beep*
d_counseling_novel_05_9,... Text from Novel.
d_counseling_novel_05_10,"no,matter,how,much,I,practice"
d_counseling_novel_05_11,"this,is,the,best,I,could,do,,,"
d_counseling_novel_05_12,I help Novel send a text.
d_counseling_novel_06_1,I have something on my mind.
d_counseling_novel_06_2,I want to dig through all the unsolved cases of the Ark...
d_counseling_novel_06_3,"But, due to tight security, it's difficult to get my hands on even just one."
d_counseling_novel_06_4,Sounds dangerous. You should stop before you run into trouble.
d_counseling_novel_06_5,Let's ask Exia for help.
d_counseling_novel_06_6,Watson...
d_counseling_novel_06_7,That's not an option for me.
d_counseling_novel_06_8,A detective's heart dies the moment they stop seeking the truth.
d_counseling_novel_06_9,!! It was right under our noses all along!
d_counseling_novel_06_10,Exia is the top hacker in the Ark.
d_counseling_novel_06_11,"I'm sure she will be able to get around the Ark's security, easy-peasy!"
d_counseling_novel_06_12,I spend some meaningful time with Novel.
d_counseling_novel_07_1,These past few days...
d_counseling_novel_07_2,I've had absolutely no cases.
d_counseling_novel_07_3,"In fact, it's been a little too quiet."
d_counseling_novel_07_4,"If this keeps up, the unemployment rate for detectives will reach 100%."
d_counseling_novel_07_5,There are cases everywhere. You just have to go and look for them.
d_counseling_novel_07_6,It's nice to take a break once in a while.
d_counseling_novel_07_7,"!! By that, you mean..."
d_counseling_novel_07_8,"Real detectives don't sit around waiting for a good mystery.
They have to get out there and find them!"
d_counseling_novel_07_9,"Thank you, Watson! This is a real epiphany!"
d_counseling_novel_07_10,Argh...
d_counseling_novel_07_11,How can unemployment be peaceful...?
d_counseling_novel_07_12,I share my thoughts on unemployment rates for detectives.
d_counseling_novel_08_1,"There are closed-room murder cases, and then there are serial killer cases."
d_counseling_novel_08_2,"If you had to choose one,"
d_counseling_novel_08_3,"which would you choose, Watson?"
d_counseling_novel_08_4,A closed-room murder case.
d_counseling_novel_08_5,A serial killer case.
d_counseling_novel_08_6,A sealed room.
d_counseling_novel_08_7,Tight surveillance that prevents anyone from going in or out without being seen.
d_counseling_novel_08_8,"But, a truly genius criminal can make it happen!!"
d_counseling_novel_08_9,"Like detective, like assistant! We are interested in the same crimes!"
d_counseling_novel_08_10,Many victims.
d_counseling_novel_08_11,"By finding vague commonalities between them,"
d_counseling_novel_08_12,we eventually catch the killer!!
d_counseling_novel_08_13,"... They're interesting, indeed, but it seems that we have slight difference in taste."
d_counseling_novel_08_14,I have a conversation about cases with Novel.
d_counseling_novel_09_1,A rival...
d_counseling_novel_09_2,I think I need a rival.
d_counseling_novel_09_3,Just like how Sherlock Holmes had Professor Moriarty and Arsene Lupin.
d_counseling_novel_09_4,I can be your rival.
d_counseling_novel_09_5,Why not ask Exotic to be your archenemy?
d_counseling_novel_09_6,Uh... That's a bit...
d_counseling_novel_09_7,"I think it would be best if you stay as my assistant, my dear Watson."
d_counseling_novel_09_8,"Oh! By Exotic, you mean...?"
d_counseling_novel_09_9,"The outlaws of the Outer Rim! Heinous criminals, sought after even by Missilis!"
d_counseling_novel_09_10,They seem formidable enough to become my rival.
d_counseling_novel_09_11,I talk with Novel about rivals.
d_counseling_novel_10_1,I'm curious.
d_counseling_novel_10_2,"Well, actually, more like concerned."
d_counseling_novel_10_3,Why are you not wearing your usual clothes?
d_counseling_novel_10_4,I have a date.
d_counseling_novel_10_5,Because today is the day I consult with you.
d_counseling_novel_10_6,!!
d_counseling_novel_10_7,Who... With who?
d_counseling_novel_10_8,"No, wait. Don't tell me. Suddenly, I'm not curious about it."
d_counseling_novel_10_9,Uh...
d_counseling_novel_10_10,Is that true?
d_counseling_novel_10_11,"Thank you. And, Watson..."
d_counseling_novel_10_12,You look really cool today.
d_counseling_novel_10_13,I share some small talk with Novel.
d_counseling_novel_11_1,Why are people losing their minds over mint chocolate?
d_counseling_novel_11_2,I can't wrap my brain around it.
d_counseling_novel_11_3,Because they don't have to brush their teeth after eating that.
d_counseling_novel_11_4,Because of a desire to be special.
d_counseling_novel_11_5,Brush teeth...?
d_counseling_novel_11_6,"If you don't brush your teeth, you will have to frequently visit the dentist..."
d_counseling_novel_11_7,I don't think there is a reason to like mint chocolate that much while losing out.
d_counseling_novel_11_8,Desire to be special?!
d_counseling_novel_11_9,Oh... That is interesting.
d_counseling_novel_11_10,How does mint chocolate satisfy that desire!!
d_counseling_novel_11_11,I need to investigate this a little deeper!
d_counseling_novel_11_12,I reasoned why people are crazy about mint chocolate with Novel.
d_counseling_novel_12_1,Hahaha! We finally managed to crack the case and apprehend the criminal!
d_counseling_novel_12_2,"In my dreams, that is..."
d_counseling_novel_12_3,You're a super sleuth even when you're dreaming!
d_counseling_novel_12_4,Who did the criminal turn out to be?
d_counseling_novel_12_5,"Thank you, Watson!"
d_counseling_novel_12_6,"No rest for the wicked, not even when you're in dreamland!"
d_counseling_novel_12_7,"I grabbed the fiend by the arm,"
d_counseling_novel_12_8,"and said, ""You sir, are the criminal! And here is the evidence!"" And then..."
d_counseling_novel_12_9,I woke up. But it sure was a fun dream.
d_counseling_novel_12_10,"... Honestly, I don't remember."
d_counseling_novel_12_11,"As soon as I woke up from my dream, it was all a bit of a blur."
d_counseling_novel_12_12,Novel and I talk more about other unsolved cases.
d_counseling_novel_13_1,My powers of deduction haven't been firing on all cylinders lately.
d_counseling_novel_13_2,"If this keeps up, I'm concerned I'll even start forgetting about key evidence."
d_counseling_novel_13_3,I'll come with you.
d_counseling_novel_13_4,Let's go to the hospital.
d_counseling_novel_13_5,You truly are a trustworthy sidekick!
d_counseling_novel_13_6,Very trustworthy indeed!
d_counseling_novel_13_7,Hmm... It's not bad enough to warrant a hospital visit.
d_counseling_novel_13_8,"But if you insist, I'll consider it..."
d_counseling_novel_13_9,I can't stand hospitals.
d_counseling_novel_13_10,Novel and I tried to come up with ways to improve her memory.
d_counseling_novel_14_1,"Hey, have you heard this line before? ""The criminal is you!"""
d_counseling_novel_14_2,What a cool line.
d_counseling_novel_14_3,"I want to come up with my own catchphrase,"
d_counseling_novel_14_4,but I'm not sure what it should be.
d_counseling_novel_14_5,"In the name of justice, you will not go unpunished!"
d_counseling_novel_14_6,"You don't need a catchphrase, you're already cool as is."
d_counseling_novel_14_7,I'm pretty sure I've heard that somewhere before.
d_counseling_novel_14_8,I want something new.
d_counseling_novel_14_9,"Haha, you think so?"
d_counseling_novel_14_10,"I certainly wasn't expecting an answer like that, but thank you, Watson."
d_counseling_novel_14_11,Novel and I try to formulate some cool one-liners for her during our discussion.
d_counseling_novel_15_1,"Watson, if there a job you would want to continue doing,"
d_counseling_novel_15_2,even if you become a millionaire?
d_counseling_novel_15_3,Having discussions with you.
d_counseling_novel_15_4,Being a Commander.
d_counseling_novel_15_5,!!
d_counseling_novel_15_6,I didn't realize these talks meant that much to you.
d_counseling_novel_15_7,I hope they don't end anytime soon either.
d_counseling_novel_15_8,Wow...
d_counseling_novel_15_9,I expected an answer along those lines.
d_counseling_novel_15_10,Novel and I fantasize about what we would do if we became millionaires.
d_counseling_novel_16_1,Hmm... I'm trying to come up with a word that'll go well with my name.
d_counseling_novel_16_2,But I'm struggling to find the right term.
d_counseling_novel_16_3,Do you have any ideas?
d_counseling_novel_16_4,Super Sleuth.
d_counseling_novel_16_5,Exuberant.
d_counseling_novel_16_6,Novel the Super Sleuth...
d_counseling_novel_16_7,That sounds great!
d_counseling_novel_16_8,I'll go with that!
d_counseling_novel_16_9,Novel the Exuberant...?
d_counseling_novel_16_10,I'm not so sure about that one...
d_counseling_novel_16_11,Do you have anything else?
d_counseling_novel_16_12,I help Novel come up with a new nickname.
d_counseling_novel_17_1,"Watson, are there any Nikkes you're particularly close with?"
d_counseling_novel_17_2,"If there are, I'm curious who it is."
d_counseling_novel_17_3,"Well, you, for one."
d_counseling_novel_17_4,No one yet.
d_counseling_novel_17_5,R-really?
d_counseling_novel_17_6,I'm honored!
d_counseling_novel_17_7,I can't believe you think so highly of me!
d_counseling_novel_17_8,...
d_counseling_novel_17_9,Are you sure?
d_counseling_novel_17_10,"I thought we had become fairly close, but..."
d_counseling_novel_17_11,"The higher your expectations, the greater the disappointment."
d_counseling_novel_17_12,Novel and I share a casual conversation.
d_counseling_novel_18_1,"Watson, how do you relieve stress?"
d_counseling_novel_18_2,"Whenever my sleuthing skills elude me,"
d_counseling_novel_18_3,I get really stressed out.
d_counseling_novel_18_4,You can try having a go at a logic puzzle.
d_counseling_novel_18_5,I turn my brain off and try to get some sleep.
d_counseling_novel_18_6,"Hey, that sounds like it'd be fun!"
d_counseling_novel_18_7,I'll go see if Exia has anything she can recommend.
d_counseling_novel_18_8,"Even if I sleep, my stress doesn't go away."
d_counseling_novel_18_9,"If anything, it only gets worse."
d_counseling_novel_18_10,I have a conversation with Novel about stress.
d_counseling_novel_19_1,Today is one of those days...
d_counseling_novel_19_2,I feel down in the dumps. I'd prefer to be alone.
d_counseling_novel_19_3,Get up to leave.
d_counseling_novel_19_4,Sit down beside her.
d_counseling_novel_19_5,...?!
d_counseling_novel_19_6,You're actually leaving?
d_counseling_novel_19_7,All that stuff about wanting to be alone... I didn't really mean it...
d_counseling_novel_19_8,"Thank you, Watson."
d_counseling_novel_19_9,"I thought I wanted to be alone, but..."
d_counseling_novel_19_10,it's comforting having you beside me.
d_counseling_novel_19_11,I quietly sat and comforted Novel.
d_counseling_novel_20_1,"Um... Hypothetically speaking, if you were to go on a date"
d_counseling_novel_20_2,"with your future girlfriend, what would you like to do?"
d_counseling_novel_20_3,Do an escape room.
d_counseling_novel_20_4,Watch a movie.
d_counseling_novel_20_5,!!
d_counseling_novel_20_6,Really?
d_counseling_novel_20_7,I'd love to do an escape room with my future boyfriend!
d_counseling_novel_20_8,So... um... would you be interested in going with...
d_counseling_novel_20_9,"Oh, so you're a cinephile."
d_counseling_novel_20_10,I have a hard time sitting in one spot for too long.
d_counseling_novel_20_11,I spend some time with Novel discussing our perfect dates.
d_counseling_pepper_01_1,It's very gloomy in the hospital these days. It feels like everyone is down in the dumps.
d_counseling_pepper_01_2,I feel depressed as well. I can't shake the feeling.
d_counseling_pepper_01_3,What can I do to change the atmosphere?
d_counseling_pepper_01_4,You should dance to cheer them up.
d_counseling_pepper_01_5,Change your gloomy hospital lights for brighter ones.
d_counseling_pepper_01_6,A cheer-up dance?!
d_counseling_pepper_01_7,H-how does that dance go?
d_counseling_pepper_01_8,"Uh... No, I won't learn it. I will never dance."
d_counseling_pepper_01_9,The lights?
d_counseling_pepper_01_10,"Huh, come to think of it, it looks like the lighting has become dimmer."
d_counseling_pepper_01_11,I'll change it immediately!
d_counseling_pepper_01_12,I help Pepper out with the atmosphere at the hospital.
d_counseling_pepper_02_1,People at the hospital say I've never dated anyone before.
d_counseling_pepper_02_2,Do you think that's true?
d_counseling_pepper_02_3,"No, of course not."
d_counseling_pepper_02_4,You've dated before?
d_counseling_pepper_02_5,Really?
d_counseling_pepper_02_6,"You're telling the truth, right? That I don't come off that way?"
d_counseling_pepper_02_7,"Haha. Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_02_8,... No.
d_counseling_pepper_02_9,"All right, it's true! I haven't!"
d_counseling_pepper_02_10,But I don't want to look like I haven't.
d_counseling_pepper_02_11,"Commander, you are so mean!"
d_counseling_pepper_02_12,I have a conversation with Pepper about dating.
d_counseling_pepper_03_1,"Commander, where do you like to take your dates?"
d_counseling_pepper_03_2,The movie theatre.
d_counseling_pepper_03_3,The library.
d_counseling_pepper_03_4,Huh? Really?
d_counseling_pepper_03_5,"Me, too! I always want to go to the movie theater."
d_counseling_pepper_03_6,"So... I guess... It's not really a date, but would you like to go with me next time?"
d_counseling_pepper_03_7,!!
d_counseling_pepper_03_8,I didn't know you were so academic!
d_counseling_pepper_03_9,I... prefer watching movies...
d_counseling_pepper_03_10,"But the library is nice, too!"
d_counseling_pepper_03_11,"I spend a nice time with Pepper, planning where to go for fun."
d_counseling_pepper_04_1,It seems that the number of patients faking illnesses has been increasing lately.
d_counseling_pepper_04_2,Why do you think that is?
d_counseling_pepper_04_3,"Maybe it's because they want to see you, Pepper."
d_counseling_pepper_04_4,So they could see Mary.
d_counseling_pepper_04_5,Me? Why?
d_counseling_pepper_04_6,I've never done anything that could get me on anyone's bad side...
d_counseling_pepper_04_7,Mary?
d_counseling_pepper_04_8,Mmm... I guess that's possible.
d_counseling_pepper_04_9,"Occasionally, some patients intentionally come to get a stinging shot from Mary..."
d_counseling_pepper_04_10,I talk with Pepper about patients with fake sicknesses.
d_counseling_pepper_05_1,"Commander, I admire Mary a lot."
d_counseling_pepper_05_2,"I want to become the best doctor, just like her."
d_counseling_pepper_05_3,"So, what do you think I should study?"
d_counseling_pepper_05_4,How to cure a patient's fake illness?
d_counseling_pepper_05_5,How to kill someone with a smile?
d_counseling_pepper_05_6,Mary is known to be kind to patients and scary to fake patients.
d_counseling_pepper_05_7,"If I study hard, I think I will be able to become a sharp doctor like her!"
d_counseling_pepper_05_8,Does she have a scary smile?
d_counseling_pepper_05_9,I never noticed that.
d_counseling_pepper_05_10,I have a conversation with Pepper about Mary.
d_counseling_pepper_06_1,"I've been thinking about this real hard. When you feel sick,"
d_counseling_pepper_06_2,I think it's best to get diagnosed and treated fast as possible.
d_counseling_pepper_06_3,"So, why do people hate coming to the hospital?"
d_counseling_pepper_06_4,Because getting a shot is scary.
d_counseling_pepper_06_5,Because Mary is scary.
d_counseling_pepper_06_6,I see! Getting a shot is quite scary...
d_counseling_pepper_06_7,A lot of people are afraid of needles.
d_counseling_pepper_06_8,Because of Mary?
d_counseling_pepper_06_9,No way. She is so nice to everyone! Except for fake patients...
d_counseling_pepper_06_10,... or annyoying patients...
d_counseling_pepper_06_11,I talk with Pepper about how to bring more people to the hospital.
d_counseling_pepper_07_1,Terrorists! Criminals!
d_counseling_pepper_07_2,I hope they suffer!
d_counseling_pepper_07_3,I hope they suffer more than everyone they've hurt!
d_counseling_pepper_07_4,Calm down.
d_counseling_pepper_07_5,... I agree.
d_counseling_pepper_07_6,Sorry. I just get so worked up.
d_counseling_pepper_07_7,There were patients who came to the hospital because of a terrorist attack...
d_counseling_pepper_07_8,I can't help but feel so angry about it.
d_counseling_pepper_07_9,"Commander, do you also think the same way?"
d_counseling_pepper_07_10,I didn't expect you'd be agreeing with me. I thought you were going to tell me to calm down...
d_counseling_pepper_07_11,I got so angry because some new patients came to the hospital after a terrorist attack...
d_counseling_pepper_07_12,I feel better knowing you're on my side.
d_counseling_pepper_07_13,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_07_14,I console an angry Pepper.
d_counseling_pepper_08_1,I heard tomorrow's weather will be very nice.
d_counseling_pepper_08_2,What should we do?
d_counseling_pepper_08_3,Clean the hospital.
d_counseling_pepper_08_4,Let's go on a date.
d_counseling_pepper_08_5,"Uh... Right. If the weather is nice, we should stay inside and clean."
d_counseling_pepper_08_6,"I was expecting something else, like... a date, maybe?"
d_counseling_pepper_08_7,... I guess I was a little immature.
d_counseling_pepper_08_8,Right! A date!
d_counseling_pepper_08_9,"But, I have no one to go with..."
d_counseling_pepper_08_10,"Commander, would you... like to go out with me?"
d_counseling_pepper_08_11,"I spend time with Pepper, talking about tomorrow's plans."
d_counseling_pepper_09_1,"Commander, please tell me your definition of a real doctor!"
d_counseling_pepper_09_2,Someone with the skill to heal all kinds of patients.
d_counseling_pepper_09_3,Someone who works for the patient.
d_counseling_pepper_09_4,You're right. Skills are very important!
d_counseling_pepper_09_5,"If you don't have the skill, the patients are not going to believe that you can save them."
d_counseling_pepper_09_6,"Haha. To be honest, I feel the same way."
d_counseling_pepper_09_7,"Even though the skill to save the patient's life is important,"
d_counseling_pepper_09_8,I feel a doctor who focuses on serving the patient
d_counseling_pepper_09_9,is always greater.
d_counseling_pepper_09_10,I have a serious conversation with Pepper about doctors.
d_counseling_pepper_10_1,"Between having something refreshing and something sweet,"
d_counseling_pepper_10_2,which one do you think can give you more energy?
d_counseling_pepper_10_3,Something refreshing.
d_counseling_pepper_10_4,Something sweet.
d_counseling_pepper_10_5,I feel the same way!
d_counseling_pepper_10_6,"When I eat something refreshing, I feel like energy is flowing back to my body."
d_counseling_pepper_10_7,Like my blood is getting filled up with vitamins.
d_counseling_pepper_10_8,As if nothing can stop me!
d_counseling_pepper_10_9,It's decided: the children's snack at the hospital will be lemon-flavored Splendamin!
d_counseling_pepper_10_10,Uh... Is that so?
d_counseling_pepper_10_11,Hmmm... I thought you were going to choose something refreshing.
d_counseling_pepper_10_12,"Hmmm. Come to think of it, when you're tired, it means you're low on sugar."
d_counseling_pepper_10_13,I guess eating something sweet really can give you some energy.
d_counseling_pepper_10_14,I discuss energy-giving foods with Pepper.
d_counseling_pepper_11_1,"Commander, it's been a while since you last came to the hospital."
d_counseling_pepper_11_2,I take it that means you're feeling well?
d_counseling_pepper_11_3,Fit as a fiddle.
d_counseling_pepper_11_4,"Actually, I'm not feeling too hot."
d_counseling_pepper_11_5,That's a relief.
d_counseling_pepper_11_6,Your health is the number one priority.
d_counseling_pepper_11_7,"Even if you're feeling perfectly fine, drop by every once in a while for a checkup."
d_counseling_pepper_11_8,What?!
d_counseling_pepper_11_9,Where aren't you feeling well?
d_counseling_pepper_11_10,Why haven't you come to the hospital?
d_counseling_pepper_11_11,Tell me about your symptoms. I want all the details.
d_counseling_pepper_11_12,I talk to Pepper about my health.
d_counseling_pepper_12_1,"According to Signal,"
d_counseling_pepper_12_2,a lot of TV shows about doctor-patient relationships are trending right now.
d_counseling_pepper_12_3,What do you make of that?
d_counseling_pepper_12_4,I find it all very romantic.
d_counseling_pepper_12_5,Doctors should treat their patients as just that: a patient.
d_counseling_pepper_12_6,It's incredibly romantic!
d_counseling_pepper_12_7,I hope one day I can experience a love like that.
d_counseling_pepper_12_8,"With that being said, I always keep my relationships with my patients strictly professional!"
d_counseling_pepper_12_9,You're right...
d_counseling_pepper_12_10,"In actuality, we should never breach the trust between us and our patients like that."
d_counseling_pepper_12_11,"I guess at the end of the day, TV shows really are just works of fiction."
d_counseling_pepper_12_12,Pepper and I have fun dissecting the intricacies of various medical field-related romantic fantasies.
d_counseling_pepper_13_1,Mary's smile always puts the people around her at ease.
d_counseling_pepper_13_2,Hehe.
d_counseling_pepper_13_3,"If I smile like this, do I look like her?"
d_counseling_pepper_13_4,Your eyes should be more moon-shaped.
d_counseling_pepper_13_5,Your smile also comforts those around you.
d_counseling_pepper_13_6,R-really?
d_counseling_pepper_13_7,But my eyes are all the way closed at this point!
d_counseling_pepper_13_8,So Pepper is practically blind whenever she's smiling.
d_counseling_pepper_13_9,R-really?
d_counseling_pepper_13_10,"Hehe... thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_13_11,So... how do you feel right now?
d_counseling_pepper_13_12,Pepper and I continue our conversation with permanent grins on our faces.
d_counseling_pepper_14_1,Administering a shot to younger patients is a real challenge.
d_counseling_pepper_14_2,Is there any way to make it easier?
d_counseling_pepper_14_3,You should use anesthesia.
d_counseling_pepper_14_4,"Give them some candy, like a lollipop."
d_counseling_pepper_14_5,You mustn't use anesthesia so recklessly!
d_counseling_pepper_14_6,You could end up causing serious injury to someone.
d_counseling_pepper_14_7,I guess all I can do is do my best to comfort them to get them through it.
d_counseling_pepper_14_8,Good idea!
d_counseling_pepper_14_9,"After they get their shot, I'll give them a little treat."
d_counseling_pepper_14_10,That way they won't be as terrified about getting a shot.
d_counseling_pepper_14_11,Pepper and I discuss the widely held fear of shots.
d_counseling_pepper_15_1,"In private rooms, we can personalize the music that we play for the patient."
d_counseling_pepper_15_2,"If you were in a private room, what kind of music would you like to hear?"
d_counseling_pepper_15_3,Something quiet and calming.
d_counseling_pepper_15_4,Something light and hopeful.
d_counseling_pepper_15_5,Just as I thought.
d_counseling_pepper_15_6,Most of the patients prefer calmer music as well.
d_counseling_pepper_15_7,I'm sure it helps put their minds at ease.
d_counseling_pepper_15_8,"As for me, I personally enjoy music with a lighter touch."
d_counseling_pepper_15_9,"I'm surprised to hear you say that, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_15_10,"Most people prefer calmer music,"
d_counseling_pepper_15_11,but there are a few patients who go the other way.
d_counseling_pepper_15_12,They say lighter music energizes them.
d_counseling_pepper_15_13,"Personally, I agree with them!"
d_counseling_pepper_15_14,Pepper and I talk about the different genres of music that are played in hospital rooms.
d_counseling_pepper_16_1,"Um, Commander... I was curious about something."
d_counseling_pepper_16_2,What do you look for in a significant other?
d_counseling_pepper_16_3,Someone who is bright and energetic.
d_counseling_pepper_16_4,Someone who is kind and loves to laugh.
d_counseling_pepper_16_5,I see...
d_counseling_pepper_16_6,That means I have a chance!
d_counseling_pepper_16_7,Or... maybe not? Is it possible? Yes? No? Ugh...!
d_counseling_pepper_16_8,I see...
d_counseling_pepper_16_9,Don't tell me it's Mary?
d_counseling_pepper_16_10,"If it is Mary, she is certainly the ideal type for a lot of people."
d_counseling_pepper_16_11,It's certainly possible.
d_counseling_pepper_16_12,I calm down the overexcited Pepper.
d_counseling_pepper_17_1,"Commander, do you prefer movies with a happy or sad ending?"
d_counseling_pepper_17_2,Sad ending.
d_counseling_pepper_17_3,Happy ending.
d_counseling_pepper_17_4,!!
d_counseling_pepper_17_5,I didn't realize there were people who preferred sad endings!
d_counseling_pepper_17_6,I suppose they do leave a deeper impression. Is it because of that?
d_counseling_pepper_17_7,Hmm... I'm not sure I agree.
d_counseling_pepper_17_8,"I prefer when everybody can laugh and get along, whether it's in a movie or in real life."
d_counseling_pepper_17_9,"Yeah, nothing beats a feel-good ending!"
d_counseling_pepper_17_10,"I love it when everybody can laugh and get along, whether it's in a movie or in real life."
d_counseling_pepper_17_11,It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
d_counseling_pepper_17_12,Pepper and I talk about movies.
d_counseling_pepper_18_1,I'm thinking of buying some perfume.
d_counseling_pepper_18_2,Commander... what kind of scent do you prefer?
d_counseling_pepper_18_3,That great hospital smell.
d_counseling_pepper_18_4,You smell good even without perfume.
d_counseling_pepper_18_5,Are you serious?
d_counseling_pepper_18_6,There's no perfume that smells like that!
d_counseling_pepper_18_7,You're just making fun of me since it's my first time buying perfume!
d_counseling_pepper_18_8,"Wait, you really think that..."
d_counseling_pepper_18_9,Hehe. Thank you.
d_counseling_pepper_18_10,Pepper and I talk about our favorite scents.
d_counseling_pepper_19_1,Commander...
d_counseling_pepper_19_2,Will there ever come a time when there are no injured or sick?
d_counseling_pepper_19_3,Um...
d_counseling_pepper_19_4,I'm sure that day will come eventually.
d_counseling_pepper_19_5,"Oh, sorry for putting you on the spot."
d_counseling_pepper_19_6,"I know it may just be a pipe dream, but..."
d_counseling_pepper_19_7,I've had a lot of patients pass away full of regrets. I guess it all got to me.
d_counseling_pepper_19_8,Thank you for listening to me.
d_counseling_pepper_19_9,"I know it may just be a pipe dream, but..."
d_counseling_pepper_19_10,I've had a lot of patients pass away full of regrets. I guess it all got to me.
d_counseling_pepper_19_11,But hearing you say that makes me feel like even the most outlandish pipe dream is possible.
d_counseling_pepper_19_12,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_19_13,I patted Pepper on her shoulder.
d_counseling_pepper_20_1,Commander.
d_counseling_pepper_20_2,"When you look at me, what's the first phrase that pops into your head?"
d_counseling_pepper_20_3,A doctor who makes people happy.
d_counseling_pepper_20_4,A highly-skilled medical professional.
d_counseling_pepper_20_5,!!
d_counseling_pepper_20_6,Wow... I'm really touched.
d_counseling_pepper_20_7,My dream is to be a doctor that makes people happy.
d_counseling_pepper_20_8,"I still have a long way to go, but I'll do my best to live up to that idea."
d_counseling_pepper_20_9,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_pepper_20_10,!!
d_counseling_pepper_20_11,I have a long way to go before I can be called a medical professional.
d_counseling_pepper_20_12,"Sigh... I'm sorry. I'm happy to hear you say that, but I wouldn't say I fit that description just yet."
d_counseling_pepper_20_13,But thank you anyway for saying that.
d_counseling_pepper_20_14,I continue showering Pepper with compliments.
d_counseling_poli_01_1,"As a police officer, I see a lot of drunks on the streets."
d_counseling_poli_01_2,"Some of them even threaten us, asking why lowly police dare to arrest them. Grr..."
d_counseling_poli_01_3,What should I do when I run into this kind of person?
d_counseling_poli_01_4,Show them who's boss.
d_counseling_poli_01_5,Let it slide. The police are only here to protect and serve.
d_counseling_poli_01_6,Good idea!
d_counseling_poli_01_7,The iron fist of the law must keep a tight grip!
d_counseling_poli_01_8,It's like you read my mind or something!
d_counseling_poli_01_9,Uh... I didn't know you were going to give such an earnest answer.
d_counseling_poli_01_10,I guess I have no choice.
d_counseling_poli_01_11,Fine. I'll be more patient with them.
d_counseling_poli_01_12,I listen to Poli talk about the challenges of being a police officer.
d_counseling_poli_02_1,"Ugh, Miranda's over-enthusiasm got the better of her again today."
d_counseling_poli_02_2,She ended up botching an investigation!
d_counseling_poli_02_3,What can I do to make her stop doing that?
d_counseling_poli_02_4,Strict punishment.
d_counseling_poli_02_5,It's better to just give up.
d_counseling_poli_02_6,I've done that so many times already. Grr...
d_counseling_poli_02_7,"And yet, she never stops making a mess."
d_counseling_poli_02_8,Ugh. Is that the only way?
d_counseling_poli_02_9,I guess I will just have to give up.
d_counseling_poli_02_10,"But I'm glad someone else thinks the same way, anyway."
d_counseling_poli_02_11,I comfort Poli about Miranda's bad habits.
d_counseling_poli_03_1,"Commander, have you heard of sweet potato-flavored Splendamin?"
d_counseling_poli_03_2,It's been getting pretty popular recently.
d_counseling_poli_03_3,"Yeah, I like it."
d_counseling_poli_03_4,Are you sure it's not just popular with you?
d_counseling_poli_03_5,Ha! I knew you'd get it!
d_counseling_poli_03_6,The greatness of sweet potato flavor!
d_counseling_poli_03_7,I can hardly live without it!
d_counseling_poli_03_8,"Hmm, Miranda said if I eat too much, I will get fat."
d_counseling_poli_03_9,Seems that it's too hard for a child like her to realize its greatness.
d_counseling_poli_03_10,"Commander! You, too?!"
d_counseling_poli_03_11,How could it...
d_counseling_poli_03_12,I praise the greatness of sweet potato-flavored Splendamin with Poli.
d_counseling_poli_04_1,"You know, I was just thinking about this the other day..."
d_counseling_poli_04_2,"If I didn't become a police officer, what do you think I would have been?"
d_counseling_poli_04_3,I think you'd make a great lapdog.
d_counseling_poli_04_4,Nothing suits you like being a police officer.
d_counseling_poli_04_5,D-dog!?
d_counseling_poli_04_6,I asked you a serious question and you're treating it like a joke?! Grrr...
d_counseling_poli_04_7,Arf! You've gone too far!
d_counseling_poli_04_8,Hmmm... Is that so?
d_counseling_poli_04_9,There's no career for me except the police...
d_counseling_poli_04_10,That sounds pretty nice!
d_counseling_poli_04_11,I have a conversation with Poli about careers.
d_counseling_poli_05_1,I like warm days best.
d_counseling_poli_05_2,They make me feel so relaxed and sleepy...
d_counseling_poli_05_3,I just wanna lie down on the ground.
d_counseling_poli_05_4,"Well, you're already pretty close to the ground."
d_counseling_poli_05_5,Do you want me to pet you?
d_counseling_poli_05_6,You are so mean.
d_counseling_poli_05_7,"Just because I'm short doesn't mean I'm always lying on the ground, you know! Grrr..."
d_counseling_poli_05_8,How did you know I wanted to be pet?
d_counseling_poli_05_9,"Commander, your instincts are as sharp as mine."
d_counseling_poli_05_10,I enjoy the warm weather with Poli.
d_counseling_poli_06_1,"Ugh... Commander, this rainy weather makes me feel like a sloth."
d_counseling_poli_06_2,My body's so drained. I'm turning into a literal couch potato.
d_counseling_poli_06_3,Do you want me to pet you?
d_counseling_poli_06_4,It's because you have dog fur.
d_counseling_poli_06_5,"Uh, I have no idea why you just said that, but since you did..."
d_counseling_poli_06_6,"I do like being stroked. I'll take it, with pleasure."
d_counseling_poli_06_7,D-dog fur!?
d_counseling_poli_06_8,"I know my hair is extremely fluffy and voluptuous,"
d_counseling_poli_06_9,but you don't get to call it dog fur!
d_counseling_poli_06_10,I talk with Poli about rainy weather.
d_counseling_poli_07_1,"A few days ago, a kid said I look like a marshmallow!"
d_counseling_poli_07_2,The nerve of that brat! Argh...
d_counseling_poli_07_3,Grr... I'm furious. Why in the world would he say that?
d_counseling_poli_07_4,Because of your fluffy hair?
d_counseling_poli_07_5,Because of your chipmunk cheeks?
d_counseling_poli_07_6,"Hmm... Okay, fair enough."
d_counseling_poli_07_7,I guess my hair is really the problem here.
d_counseling_poli_07_8,Hmmm... But it's part of who I am.
d_counseling_poli_07_9,I'm not gonna change it just cuz of some nosy kids.
d_counseling_poli_07_10,Ch-cheeks?!
d_counseling_poli_07_11,I-I didn't expect that...
d_counseling_poli_07_12,"... Fine! I've decided. I'm going to go on a diet, starting today!"
d_counseling_poli_07_13,Then no one will ever say I look like a marshmallow again!
d_counseling_poli_07_14,"Thanks for the tip, Commander!"
d_counseling_poli_07_15,"I talk with Poli, who really does look like a marshmallow."
d_counseling_poli_08_1,"Commander, tell me the truth."
d_counseling_poli_08_2,Are you a dog person or a cat person?
d_counseling_poli_08_3,"Of course, a dog person."
d_counseling_poli_08_4,Definitely a cat person.
d_counseling_poli_08_5,"Haha, I knew it!"
d_counseling_poli_08_6,Your smell told me everything!
d_counseling_poli_08_7,C-cat person? Grrr...
d_counseling_poli_08_8,"Wh-why...?! Usually, you can't keep your eyes off of my fluffy hair!"
d_counseling_poli_08_9,I can't accept this! Arrgghh...
d_counseling_poli_08_10,I have a serious discussion with Poli about the loveliness of puppies.
d_counseling_poli_09_1,"Commander, I'm in a really bad mood right now!"
d_counseling_poli_09_2,How can I calm down?
d_counseling_poli_09_3,Come here. Let me pet you.
d_counseling_poli_09_4,Just get rid of whatever's bothering you.
d_counseling_poli_09_5,Sounds like a plan!
d_counseling_poli_09_6,Looks like I really asked the right person!
d_counseling_poli_09_7,But the person I'm angry at is myself.
d_counseling_poli_09_8,It'd be pretty impractical to get rid of myself...
d_counseling_poli_09_9,Ugh.
d_counseling_poli_09_10,I try to calm Poli down.
d_counseling_poli_10_1,Commander. Listen carefully.
d_counseling_poli_10_2,I ate some pudding and put the leftovers in the fridge.
d_counseling_poli_10_3,"But, Miranda got hungry and ate it all."
d_counseling_poli_10_4,"Miranda told me she didn't know the pudding was mine, and that she was about to starve to death."
d_counseling_poli_10_5,Should I believe her?
d_counseling_poli_10_6,It sounds like the cowardly excuse of a criminal.
d_counseling_poli_10_7,Wouldn't it be better to trust her word?
d_counseling_poli_10_8,That's right!
d_counseling_poli_10_9,It's time to drop the hammer of justice on that criminal! Grr...
d_counseling_poli_10_10,Wooo... trust her?
d_counseling_poli_10_11,Do I really have to?!
d_counseling_poli_10_12,I try to console Poli's anger against Miranda.
d_counseling_poli_11_1,I was watching a crime thriller with Miranda today
d_counseling_poli_11_2,and she had no idea who the criminal was.
d_counseling_poli_11_3,It was so obvious who they were too!
d_counseling_poli_11_4,"You're a veteran police officer, so spotting criminals is practically second nature for you."
d_counseling_poli_11_5,"You... didn't by any chance know who the criminal was before you watched the movie, did you?"
d_counseling_poli_11_6,"You really think that, Commander?"
d_counseling_poli_11_7,That makes me feel good!
d_counseling_poli_11_8,That's probably why I was able to figure out who the criminal was!
d_counseling_poli_11_9,What do you mean?!
d_counseling_poli_11_10,I would never resort to such a dirty trick!
d_counseling_poli_11_11,I have pride in my policing skills.
d_counseling_poli_11_12,Poli and I talk more about the criminal in the movie that she watched.
d_counseling_poli_12_1,I've been thinking about changing my hairstyle.
d_counseling_poli_12_2,What kind of style should I change it to?
d_counseling_poli_12_3,I think what you've got going on now suits you perfectly.
d_counseling_poli_12_4,A cute pixie cut.
d_counseling_poli_12_5,"Agreed. Even though I want to change it,"
d_counseling_poli_12_6,no other hairstyle really tickles my fancy.
d_counseling_poli_12_7,"Anyway, I guess I'll just keep it like it is then."
d_counseling_poli_12_8,A pixie cut?!
d_counseling_poli_12_9,Doing that would only
d_counseling_poli_12_10,make my hair more curly!
d_counseling_poli_12_11,Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps...
d_counseling_poli_12_12,Poli and I talk more in an effort to figure out a hairstyle she'll like.
d_counseling_poli_13_1,"Commander, do you prefer spending time alone,"
d_counseling_poli_13_2,or going out with a group of people?
d_counseling_poli_13_3,I enjoy being around you.
d_counseling_poli_13_4,I enjoy going out with a big group.
d_counseling_poli_13_5,Where did that come from?!
d_counseling_poli_13_6,"However, it's not a bad answer."
d_counseling_poli_13_7,I enjoy spending time with you as well.
d_counseling_poli_13_8,"A big group, huh?"
d_counseling_poli_13_9,I tend to have more fun in smaller groups.
d_counseling_poli_13_10,Poli and I talk more about how we prefer hanging out with others.
d_counseling_poli_14_1,"Commander, if I was a toy,"
d_counseling_poli_14_2,what type of toy do you think I would be?
d_counseling_poli_14_3,An adorable stuffed puppy.
d_counseling_poli_14_4,A bad-to-the-bone police figurine.
d_counseling_poli_14_5,A puppy?! Grrr...
d_counseling_poli_14_6,I'd pick badass over cute any day.
d_counseling_poli_14_7,Nice!
d_counseling_poli_14_8,I'd rather be a badass than cute.
d_counseling_poli_14_9,Thanks for letting me know what you think.
d_counseling_poli_14_10,"Who knows, if I keep making my mark, store shelves may be flooded with Poli figurines one day."
d_counseling_poli_14_11,Poli and I pondered how to make Poli figurines.
d_counseling_poli_15_1,"Commander, is there any other career you'd like to try out other than what you're doing now?"
d_counseling_poli_15_2,"I'd like to give being a police officer a shot, like you."
d_counseling_poli_15_3,I'd want to be a dog sitter.
d_counseling_poli_15_4,"It's good you want to be a police officer, but if you want to get to my level,"
d_counseling_poli_15_5,it won't be easy!
d_counseling_poli_15_6,"However, if I have you under my supervision,"
d_counseling_poli_15_7,I may have more fun on the job!
d_counseling_poli_15_8,A dog sitter?
d_counseling_poli_15_9,Now there's an answer I didn't expect.
d_counseling_poli_15_10,"Hey, you're not poking fun at me, are you? Grrrr..."
d_counseling_poli_15_11,Poli and I had fun imagining all sorts of careers we'd like to try out.
d_counseling_poli_16_1,*Grrrr*
d_counseling_poli_16_2,Is there a dog nearby?
d_counseling_poli_16_3,What's going on?
d_counseling_poli_16_4,What?!
d_counseling_poli_16_5,"I was already in a bad mood, and you're only making it worse!"
d_counseling_poli_16_6,*Grrrr*
d_counseling_poli_16_7,"Let me tell you, I am seriously peeved!"
d_counseling_poli_16_8,Some wino tried to pick a fight with me today.
d_counseling_poli_16_9,He kept making fun of my bark... Grrrrrr
d_counseling_poli_16_10,I do my best to calm down Poli.
d_counseling_poli_17_1,"Today, I don't want to do anything. I just want to kick back and relax."
d_counseling_poli_17_2,I have so much to do though...
d_counseling_poli_17_3,"Forget all that, let's hang out."
d_counseling_poli_17_4,Let's hang out after you're done.
d_counseling_poli_17_5,!!
d_counseling_poli_17_6,Right now? Where? Do you think we should...?
d_counseling_poli_17_7,"Yeah, sure! Work hard, play hard, right?"
d_counseling_poli_17_8,Let's go to the park.
d_counseling_poli_17_9,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_poli_17_10,But I can't seem to concentrate.
d_counseling_poli_17_11,Do you want to hang out when I'm done with work?
d_counseling_poli_17_12,I have a fun time hanging out with Poli.
d_counseling_poli_18_1,"Drats, just look at this! I scraped my knee again today."
d_counseling_poli_18_2,I had a good streak of no injuries going too... at least I didn't take too hard a spill.
d_counseling_poli_18_3,Change the bandage.
d_counseling_poli_18_4,You should be more careful.
d_counseling_poli_18_5,"Huh? Oh, you don't have to... thanks!"
d_counseling_poli_18_6,I'm sure that'll help it heal more quickly.
d_counseling_poli_18_7,I could say the same thing to you!
d_counseling_poli_18_8,"Anyway, I was being careful! And I still got injured!"
d_counseling_poli_18_9,I talk to Poli as I look more closely at her wound.
d_counseling_poli_19_1,"When I was on patrol today, this little girl said,"
d_counseling_poli_19_2,Poli! Curly! Cool!
d_counseling_poli_19_3,What do you think she meant?
d_counseling_poli_19_4,Your hair is cool because it's so curly.
d_counseling_poli_19_5,She thinks that you're cool.
d_counseling_poli_19_6,So she liked my hair?
d_counseling_poli_19_7,Hmm... I guess it is kinda cool.
d_counseling_poli_19_8,Me? Cool?
d_counseling_poli_19_9,"Well, I guess it's always nice to hear a compliment."
d_counseling_poli_19_10,Poli and I have a nice chat.
d_counseling_poli_20_1,I want to be on the force until the day I die.
d_counseling_poli_20_2,Think I can do it?
d_counseling_poli_20_3,"In your case Poli, I think it's possible."
d_counseling_poli_20_4,There's no such thing as lifelong careers anymore.
d_counseling_poli_20_5,"Woof, woof! That's awesome to hear you say that!"
d_counseling_poli_20_6,I'll protect you until the very end.
d_counseling_poli_20_7,"Fair enough, good point... but you don't have to be such a party pooper..."
d_counseling_poli_20_8,I still want to do this job for life.
d_counseling_poli_20_9,Poli and I have a conversation about career aspirations.
d_counseling_privaty_01_1,I've been a little spend-happy recently.
d_counseling_privaty_01_2,How do I cut back on my spending and save money?
d_counseling_privaty_01_3,Just stop shopping.
d_counseling_privaty_01_4,"Keep spending. When you go bankrupt, naturally you'll stop spending."
d_counseling_privaty_01_5,H-how can you suggest such a thing?!
d_counseling_privaty_01_6,It's one of the few joys I have left in my life...
d_counseling_privaty_01_7,"You should be more sensitive, Commander!"
d_counseling_privaty_01_8,!!
d_counseling_privaty_01_9,"C'mon, I'm not that much of a lost cause!"
d_counseling_privaty_01_10,...
d_counseling_privaty_01_11,"Well, maybe I will spend a little more. But I'm not going bankrupt!"
d_counseling_privaty_01_12,I talk more with Privaty about finances.
d_counseling_privaty_02_1,Commander.
d_counseling_privaty_02_2,Would you splurge for good quality? Or do you always save money?
d_counseling_privaty_02_3,The cheaper the better.
d_counseling_privaty_02_4,"I'm fine with anything, so long as it tastes good."
d_counseling_privaty_02_5,Hm! I expected as much.
d_counseling_privaty_02_6,Spoken like someone just scraping by in a slum.
d_counseling_privaty_02_7,"And by 'slum', I mean your Outpost, of course."
d_counseling_privaty_02_8,"Well, of course! That's a given!"
d_counseling_privaty_02_9,...
d_counseling_privaty_02_10,But it is a wise answer.
d_counseling_privaty_02_11,"It's not what I expected, so I like it."
d_counseling_privaty_02_12,"I hang out a little longer with Privaty, who is grumpy but enjoys gossiping."
d_counseling_privaty_03_1,Yulha's been nagging me a lot lately.
d_counseling_privaty_03_2,"Admi's really been on my case, too."
d_counseling_privaty_03_3,What's their problem?
d_counseling_privaty_03_4,It's because they like you.
d_counseling_privaty_03_5,It's because you're sloppy.
d_counseling_privaty_03_6,That's what I thought too...
d_counseling_privaty_03_7,Well... I can't say I feel the same way about them.
d_counseling_privaty_03_8,"Then again, I do trust them as teammates..."
d_counseling_privaty_03_9,So maybe I should listen to their advice. Just a little.
d_counseling_privaty_03_10,Me? Sloppy?!
d_counseling_privaty_03_11,Who are you calling sloppy?!
d_counseling_privaty_03_12,You're full of it!
d_counseling_privaty_03_13,"I hang out a little while longer with Privaty, who pretends she doesn't like to gossip."
d_counseling_privaty_04_1,"Commander, you have to tell the truth."
d_counseling_privaty_04_2,"If Rapi and I got into a fight, whose side would you take?"
d_counseling_privaty_04_3,Yours.
d_counseling_privaty_04_4,Can I say Rapi?
d_counseling_privaty_04_5,No surprise there.
d_counseling_privaty_04_6,"Even though you and Rapi are practically joined at the hip, you still have a soft spot for me."
d_counseling_privaty_04_7,I'll keep that in mind.
d_counseling_privaty_04_8,Of course not!
d_counseling_privaty_04_9,"I'm the one asking, so you have to pick me!"
d_counseling_privaty_04_10,How can you even ask such a thing? Do you really like Rapi that much?!
d_counseling_privaty_04_11,I spend time with a thoroughly irascible Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_05_1,"I ran into Yulha, but she just gave me a death glare the whole time."
d_counseling_privaty_05_2,"She nagged me half to death, then just walked off."
d_counseling_privaty_05_3,I'm feeling a little upset about it.
d_counseling_privaty_05_4,Isn't that how Yulha always is?
d_counseling_privaty_05_5,Yulha isn't being fair to you.
d_counseling_privaty_05_6,You think I don't know that?!
d_counseling_privaty_05_7,"Comfort, you idiot! I want someone to comfort me!"
d_counseling_privaty_05_8,*Sigh*
d_counseling_privaty_05_9,Not really.
d_counseling_privaty_05_10,Yulha is just like that with everyone.
d_counseling_privaty_05_11,It didn't upset me that much.
d_counseling_privaty_05_12,...
d_counseling_privaty_05_13,But I feel better after hearing you take my side.
d_counseling_privaty_05_14,"I comfort Privaty, who is upset."
d_counseling_privaty_06_1,I think Admi may be going through puberty.
d_counseling_privaty_06_2,She's been making all these heavy sighing noises lately.
d_counseling_privaty_06_3,I hope nothing's wrong with her.
d_counseling_privaty_06_4,Does she only sigh when she sees you?
d_counseling_privaty_06_5,Puberty is often a very perplexing thing.
d_counseling_privaty_06_6,Maybe? Does she?
d_counseling_privaty_06_7,... Wait a minute.
d_counseling_privaty_06_8,What does that mean?!
d_counseling_privaty_06_9,Are you saying I'm the one that's making her feel this way?
d_counseling_privaty_06_10,You're right. Everyone gets a little confused when they're going through puberty.
d_counseling_privaty_06_11,I guess all her sighing isn't so strange.
d_counseling_privaty_06_12,Maybe I should start treating her more like an adult.
d_counseling_privaty_06_13,I chat a while longer with Privaty about Admi.
d_counseling_privaty_07_1,"Look, I'm gonna ask you a question, but don't read too much into it."
d_counseling_privaty_07_2,I'm not even that curious! Honestly!
d_counseling_privaty_07_3,But... what's your type?
d_counseling_privaty_07_4,"Someone who's aloof and chic, but not TOO well put together."
d_counseling_privaty_07_5,"Someone with a tough exterior, but who is sweet and innocent once you get to know them."
d_counseling_privaty_07_6,Huh?
d_counseling_privaty_07_7,That sounds so dumb.
d_counseling_privaty_07_8,"Still though, aloof and chic describes me pretty well."
d_counseling_privaty_07_9,I'll take it.
d_counseling_privaty_07_10,Huh?
d_counseling_privaty_07_11,What kind of idiot...
d_counseling_privaty_07_12,!!
d_counseling_privaty_07_13,"Wait, don't tell me you like Yulha?"
d_counseling_privaty_07_14,That's a perfect description of her.
d_counseling_privaty_07_15,I argue with Privaty about what we look for in a person.
d_counseling_privaty_08_1,"Commander, why do you want to operate on the surface?"
d_counseling_privaty_08_2,Have you ever considered...
d_counseling_privaty_08_3,working for the Central Government?
d_counseling_privaty_08_4,"So, you want to work more closely with me?"
d_counseling_privaty_08_5,I'm perfectly happy being a Commander.
d_counseling_privaty_08_6,W-w-who says I want to work with you?!
d_counseling_privaty_08_7,"I just wanted to see if you'd ever have a change of heart, that's all!"
d_counseling_privaty_08_8,"Yeah, that's it. I'm just testing you to see whether or not you truly like the Outpost."
d_counseling_privaty_08_9,I knew you would say that.
d_counseling_privaty_08_10,That's what I've always liked about...!!
d_counseling_privaty_08_11,W-wait! That's not what I meant!
d_counseling_privaty_08_12,I-I just meant it's good for a Commander to think that way!
d_counseling_privaty_08_13,I calm down the flustered Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_09_1,"Commander, I've made up my mind."
d_counseling_privaty_09_2,"Starting today, I won't let what anyone else says affect me."
d_counseling_privaty_09_3,"O-of course I've always been strong, but starting today I'll be even stronger."
d_counseling_privaty_09_4,"So, with that in mind, go on and try to say something that would upset me."
d_counseling_privaty_09_5,I'm dating Rapi.
d_counseling_privaty_09_6,"Privaty, I like you."
d_counseling_privaty_09_7,"Pssh, is that all you've got?"
d_counseling_privaty_09_8,Trying to get my goat with such tired methods... how disappointing.
d_counseling_privaty_09_9,...
d_counseling_privaty_09_10,"You're not actually serious, are you?"
d_counseling_privaty_09_11,!!!
d_counseling_privaty_09_12,Um... Erm... Uhhhh!
d_counseling_privaty_09_13,How can you say something like that?! That's cheating!
d_counseling_privaty_09_14,I spend some time chatting with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_10_1,"Commander, um..."
d_counseling_privaty_10_2,"if you were in a relationship, and went out on a date..."
d_counseling_privaty_10_3,where would you want to go?
d_counseling_privaty_10_4,The stores on Royal Road.
d_counseling_privaty_10_5,A cafe in the Outpost.
d_counseling_privaty_10_6,Royal Road? That's unexpected.
d_counseling_privaty_10_7,I thought you had no interest in shopping...
d_counseling_privaty_10_8,"Well, there's certainly plenty to see and do around Royal Road. It would be perfect for a date."
d_counseling_privaty_10_9,A cafe at the Outpost?!
d_counseling_privaty_10_10,Why on earth would you go on a date there?
d_counseling_privaty_10_11,"I mean, sure, I like coffee, but still!"
d_counseling_privaty_10_12,That's not a proper date at all!
d_counseling_privaty_10_13,You've got to go somewhere nicer than that!
d_counseling_privaty_10_14,I argue with Privaty about this imaginary date.
d_counseling_privaty_11_1,"I lucked out and managed to snag two tickets to the movies,"
d_counseling_privaty_11_2,but Yulha is busy and I can't seem to find Admi...
d_counseling_privaty_11_3,Who else could I possibly go to the movies with?
d_counseling_privaty_11_4,Is it okay if I go with you?
d_counseling_privaty_11_5,"If you want me to go with you, just ask."
d_counseling_privaty_11_6,Sigh...
d_counseling_privaty_11_7,"I guess I'm all out of options at this point. Fine, if you want to."
d_counseling_privaty_11_8,What time should we meet up?
d_counseling_privaty_11_9,What?!
d_counseling_privaty_11_10,"You don't think I brought this up just to get you to come along, do you?"
d_counseling_privaty_11_11,"Besides, why are you eavesdropping on me when I'm talking to myself?!"
d_counseling_privaty_11_12,Privaty and I talk about movies.
d_counseling_privaty_12_1,"If peace is one day restored up on the surface,"
d_counseling_privaty_12_2,what kind of life do you want to live?
d_counseling_privaty_12_3,I'd like to spend my days raising a family.
d_counseling_privaty_12_4,I want to live alone in a quiet place.
d_counseling_privaty_12_5,F-family?!
d_counseling_privaty_12_6,Just who exactly makes up this family?
d_counseling_privaty_12_7,"No, don't tell me!"
d_counseling_privaty_12_8,I knew it.
d_counseling_privaty_12_9,so I can't blame you for feeling that way.
d_counseling_privaty_12_10,But wouldn't it be lonely being all on your own?
d_counseling_privaty_12_11,"Before we finished our discussion, Privaty and I speculated on my future life."
d_counseling_privaty_13_1,I've noticed there are a lot of new TV shows and novels about forbidden love affairs between a Commander and their Nikkes.
d_counseling_privaty_13_2,"What are your thoughts, Commander?"
d_counseling_privaty_13_3,Sounds like a fascinating plot.
d_counseling_privaty_13_4,I'm not too fond of it.
d_counseling_privaty_13_5,R-r-really?!
d_counseling_privaty_13_6,"Actually, I think it's not too bad either."
d_counseling_privaty_13_7,Who knows... Maybe it could even happen in real life...
d_counseling_privaty_13_8,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_privaty_13_9,"I mean... yeah, right!"
d_counseling_privaty_13_10,"Come on, forbidden love between a Commander and a Nikke? It's absurd!"
d_counseling_privaty_13_11,Privaty and I talk more about forbidden love.
d_counseling_privaty_14_1,I'm thinking of changing my hairstyle.
d_counseling_privaty_14_2,I wanted to know what you think...
d_counseling_privaty_14_3,What kind of hairstyle do you think would suit me?
d_counseling_privaty_14_4,Nothing could top the hairstyle you have now.
d_counseling_privaty_14_5,I'm not sure.
d_counseling_privaty_14_6,Seriously?!
d_counseling_privaty_14_7,I'll keep this hairstyle... for now.
d_counseling_privaty_14_8,"Don't get it twisted, this has nothing to do with what you just said!"
d_counseling_privaty_14_9,"Come on, throw me a bone here!"
d_counseling_privaty_14_10,You could at least say if you like it better tied up or let down...
d_counseling_privaty_14_11,...
d_counseling_privaty_14_12,Forget it. I'll just leave it like this.
d_counseling_privaty_14_13,I spend some time thinking about new potential hairstyles for Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_15_1,Your room smells nice today.
d_counseling_privaty_15_2,I just came out of the shower.
d_counseling_privaty_15_3,I'm using a new air freshener.
d_counseling_privaty_15_4,"Oh, er... then..."
d_counseling_privaty_15_5,That smell must be Commander's shampoo...?
d_counseling_privaty_15_6,Gah! I mean... I was just talking to myself! Just ignore me!
d_counseling_privaty_15_7,R-really?
d_counseling_privaty_15_8,Can you tell me what brand you're using?
d_counseling_privaty_15_9,I ended my discussion with Privaty while surrounded by a pleasant aroma.
d_counseling_privaty_16_1,Special occasions like a birthday or anniversary
d_counseling_privaty_16_2,can make an otherwise normal day special.
d_counseling_privaty_16_3,"If you were to make today as a special day, what would it be for?"
d_counseling_privaty_16_4,Our very first time.
d_counseling_privaty_16_5,One of the days where we sit down and talk.
d_counseling_privaty_16_6,O-our first time?!
d_counseling_privaty_16_7,First time for what?
d_counseling_privaty_16_8,S-stop filling my head with dirty thoughts!
d_counseling_privaty_16_9,But we always have these discussions.
d_counseling_privaty_16_10,Y-you do it with all the other Nikkes too...
d_counseling_privaty_16_11,What makes you consider this day to be so special?
d_counseling_privaty_16_12,Privaty and I share a special moment together.
d_counseling_privaty_17_1,I went shopping recently.
d_counseling_privaty_17_2,How do you think this looks on me?
d_counseling_privaty_17_3,It's perfect.
d_counseling_privaty_17_4,It doesn't really suit you.
d_counseling_privaty_17_5,Really?
d_counseling_privaty_17_6,"I knew it would look good on me,"
d_counseling_privaty_17_7,but it's nice to hear it from someone else.
d_counseling_privaty_17_8,Hey! You could at least say it looks okay on me!
d_counseling_privaty_17_9,Don't you have any common sense?
d_counseling_privaty_17_10,Privaty and I share yet another meaningful discussion.
d_counseling_privaty_18_1,I've been having the worst dreams.
d_counseling_privaty_18_2,Have you had any memorable dreams lately?
d_counseling_privaty_18_3,Yes... but it'd be a bit awkward telling you about it.
d_counseling_privaty_18_4,"No, not really."
d_counseling_privaty_18_5,What?
d_counseling_privaty_18_6,What kind of dream could it possibly be...
d_counseling_privaty_18_7,!!
d_counseling_privaty_18_8,D-don't tell me anything more! How embarrassing!
d_counseling_privaty_18_9,Yeah?
d_counseling_privaty_18_10,I guess there are a lot of dreams that we don't remember.
d_counseling_privaty_18_11,A bit of a boring answer... although I expected as much.
d_counseling_privaty_18_12,Privaty and I talk about dreams.
d_counseling_privaty_19_1,Huh?
d_counseling_privaty_19_2,You don't look so good.
d_counseling_privaty_19_3,Did you not sleep well last night?
d_counseling_privaty_19_4,How did you know?
d_counseling_privaty_19_5,"Not at all, I slept great."
d_counseling_privaty_19_6,"I'm just attentive, that's all!"
d_counseling_privaty_19_7,It's not like I single you out for attention any more than anyone else!
d_counseling_privaty_19_8,"... But if you're tired, we can go easy with our discussion today."
d_counseling_privaty_19_9,Really...?
d_counseling_privaty_19_10,You seem more tired than usual...
d_counseling_privaty_19_11,"Well, if you say you're okay, I'll just take your word for it."
d_counseling_privaty_19_12,Privaty and I share yet another meaningful discussion.
d_counseling_privaty_20_1,"Commander, isn't there anything you covet?"
d_counseling_privaty_20_2,Anything that you would kill to have right now?
d_counseling_privaty_20_3,No I haven't.
d_counseling_privaty_20_4,Maybe some new clothes... or a pair of shoes...
d_counseling_privaty_20_5,Ha! I envy you.
d_counseling_privaty_20_6,"I've been filled with so much desire lately, that it's honestly a little worrying."
d_counseling_privaty_20_7,"... After we're done here, I should go shopping."
d_counseling_privaty_20_8,!!
d_counseling_privaty_20_9,So there is something you would like to have!
d_counseling_privaty_20_10,Why don't you come with me once we're done here?
d_counseling_privaty_20_11,"Erm... by that I mean you can tag along and we can go shopping together, that's all."
d_counseling_privaty_20_12,I have a conversation with Privaty about various things we want.
d_counseling_rapi_01_1,Commander.
d_counseling_rapi_01_2,Food supplies in the Outpost are dwindling.
d_counseling_rapi_01_3,I'll only eat half-portions from now on.
d_counseling_rapi_01_4,We'll have to go without food.
d_counseling_rapi_01_5,That won't be necessary.
d_counseling_rapi_01_6,We do not need to eat at all.
d_counseling_rapi_01_7,There's no need for you to make such a sacrifice.
d_counseling_rapi_01_8,We cannot do that.
d_counseling_rapi_01_9,Giving up when the chips are down will only dampen everyone's spirits even further.
d_counseling_rapi_01_10,Rapi and I investigate who could have been the culprit who exhausted the food supplies.
d_counseling_rapi_02_1,"Commander, I am curious."
d_counseling_rapi_02_2,What are your opinions on private personal space?
d_counseling_rapi_02_3,It's nice. You can have some time to yourself.
d_counseling_rapi_02_4,It can get lonely sometimes.
d_counseling_rapi_02_5,I see.
d_counseling_rapi_02_6,I will take that into consideration when making plans.
d_counseling_rapi_02_7,"Ah. As I presumed, there are both pros and cons."
d_counseling_rapi_02_8,I suppose there are two sides to every coin.
d_counseling_rapi_02_9,I spend some quiet time together with Rapi.
d_counseling_rapi_03_1,"When we're not on an operation, we are free to do whatever we want."
d_counseling_rapi_03_2,"We spend a lot of time training, but even then, we often have a lot of time left over."
d_counseling_rapi_03_3,"As such, I've been thinking of picking up a hobby."
d_counseling_rapi_03_4,Just kick your feet up and while the hours away.
d_counseling_rapi_03_5,How about doing a different kind of training?
d_counseling_rapi_03_6,It's definitely tempting to spend the rest of my time like that.
d_counseling_rapi_03_7,"However, I was hoping I could do something meaningful."
d_counseling_rapi_03_8,Another type of training?
d_counseling_rapi_03_9,"It's a good suggestion, though it's not necessarily a hobby. Thank you for the advice."
d_counseling_rapi_03_10,I spend some free time together with Rapi.
d_counseling_rapi_04_1,The paperwork at Counters is simple enough.
d_counseling_rapi_04_2,"However, sometimes there isn't enough time to do it all on my own."
d_counseling_rapi_04_3,Surely there must be a way to get things done more efficiently...
d_counseling_rapi_04_4,Have Anis and Neon help you.
d_counseling_rapi_04_5,I can help you.
d_counseling_rapi_04_6,...
d_counseling_rapi_04_7,I will pretend I didn't hear that.
d_counseling_rapi_04_8,I couldn't accept that. You must always be ready to head out at a moment's notice.
d_counseling_rapi_04_9,But... it's the thought that counts. I do appreciate it.
d_counseling_rapi_04_10,I hear all about Rapi's struggles with mounds of paperwork.
d_counseling_rapi_05_1,"I'm not sure if I should say this. I don't want to be a tattletale, but..."
d_counseling_rapi_05_2,Anis is starting to become unbearable.
d_counseling_rapi_05_3,"She never cleans up, not even a little bit."
d_counseling_rapi_05_4,I'll try talking to her.
d_counseling_rapi_05_5,Give her a good talking-to.
d_counseling_rapi_05_6,...
d_counseling_rapi_05_7,Thank you.
d_counseling_rapi_05_8,"I'm not Anis' superior, so I can't discipline her."
d_counseling_rapi_05_9,Rapi tells me more about Anis's recent behavior.
d_counseling_rapi_06_1,Anis opens and closes the refrigerator door too often.
d_counseling_rapi_06_2,"She ended up breaking it a few days ago. Fortunately, Liter came and fixed it."
d_counseling_rapi_06_3,I don't understand why Anis acts this way.
d_counseling_rapi_06_4,Maybe she just wants to blow off steam?
d_counseling_rapi_06_5,"There's a legend that if you open and close it 100 times, pudding will come out."
d_counseling_rapi_06_6,I don't think that's the reason.
d_counseling_rapi_06_7,She had a blanket wrapped around her when she opened it.
d_counseling_rapi_06_8,"... Commander, I don't believe in such ridiculous tall tales."
d_counseling_rapi_06_9,"But if Anis believes it, then there's nothing I can do."
d_counseling_rapi_06_10,I'll just have to leave her to her own devices.
d_counseling_rapi_06_11,I talk with Rapi about the most popular refrigerator models.
d_counseling_rapi_07_1,Why hasn't the shower in our dorm been fixed?
d_counseling_rapi_07_2,"Mighty Tools came by to repair it, but nothing's changed."
d_counseling_rapi_07_3,Could there be something else going on?
d_counseling_rapi_07_4,You just reminded me of a ghost story.
d_counseling_rapi_07_5,"Yep, there's definitely a ghost in the showers."
d_counseling_rapi_07_6,Really?
d_counseling_rapi_07_7,"I, uh, I have go to. Bye."
d_counseling_rapi_07_8,A ghost?
d_counseling_rapi_07_9,I don't believe in ghosts.
d_counseling_rapi_07_10,No... absolutely not.
d_counseling_rapi_07_11,N-not one bit.
d_counseling_rapi_07_12,Rapi bolts out of the room.
d_counseling_rapi_08_1,"A while ago, Neon lost a shell. She stayed up all night and looked for it everywhere."
d_counseling_rapi_08_2,"I helped her, and we were eventually able to find it, but... I was jealous of Neon."
d_counseling_rapi_08_3,I was jealous that she had something that mattered so much to her.
d_counseling_rapi_08_4,I wonder... will I ever find something that means that much to me?
d_counseling_rapi_08_5,We can take our time finding it. Together.
d_counseling_rapi_08_6,What about me?
d_counseling_rapi_08_7,Very well.
d_counseling_rapi_08_8,I do hope we find something.
d_counseling_rapi_08_9,... I'm not sure about that.
d_counseling_rapi_08_10,Rapi and I discuss the things we hold dear.
d_counseling_rapi_09_1,I had a dream.
d_counseling_rapi_09_2,"A butterfly with sparkling wings landed on my hand, then disappeared as soon as the light hit it."
d_counseling_rapi_09_3,What does it mean?
d_counseling_rapi_09_4,It's about something precious being broken.
d_counseling_rapi_09_5,It's about your troubles melting away.
d_counseling_rapi_09_6,So it was a nightmare.
d_counseling_rapi_09_7,I should watch my back today.
d_counseling_rapi_09_8,I suppose that's one interpretation...
d_counseling_rapi_09_9,Thank you for cheering me up.
d_counseling_rapi_09_10,I talk about dreams with Rapi.
d_counseling_rapi_10_1,"I'm not a picky eater, but having the same thing several days in a row can get tiring."
d_counseling_rapi_10_2,"However, given our current food situation, I shouldn't complain."
d_counseling_rapi_10_3,What do you think I should do?
d_counseling_rapi_10_4,Complain while you eat.
d_counseling_rapi_10_5,Just grin and bear it.
d_counseling_rapi_10_6,"I see. If things aren't going to change anyway, there's no harm in letting off some steam."
d_counseling_rapi_10_7,"It will be a nice way to vent. Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_rapi_10_8,"You mean to say that, if we're powerless to change something, then we should just accept it?"
d_counseling_rapi_10_9,"Very well. That's what I've been doing up until now, anyway."
d_counseling_rapi_10_10,I talk about food preferences with Rapi.
d_counseling_rapi_11_1,"Lately, there have been more Nikkes at the Outpost than usual."
d_counseling_rapi_11_2,"On the plus side, it's increased the number of troops we have available, but it's also led to a few more altercations and other incidents."
d_counseling_rapi_11_3,We should open our own court.
d_counseling_rapi_11_4,We can go on patrol together.
d_counseling_rapi_11_5,We've already got one.
d_counseling_rapi_11_6,It's just never been used properly
d_counseling_rapi_11_7,"Right, everyone is so fond of you that they may not be willing to cause a ruckus so openly if you're around."
d_counseling_rapi_11_8,"Just let me know what time works for you, and I'll let you join me."
d_counseling_rapi_11_9,Rapi and I discussed how to maintain peace in the Outpost.
d_counseling_rapi_12_1,"Anis and Neon are always bickering over something trivial,"
d_counseling_rapi_12_2,but there is at least one thing where they're in complete agreement.
d_counseling_rapi_12_3,...
d_counseling_rapi_12_4,Is it when they're teasing you?
d_counseling_rapi_12_5,Is it when they complain about the food?
d_counseling_rapi_12_6,So you already knew?
d_counseling_rapi_12_7,It's starting to become a concern. Especially since it seems there's no end in sight.
d_counseling_rapi_12_8,"That is also true but,"
d_counseling_rapi_12_9,even then they still tend to get into it at times.
d_counseling_rapi_12_10,I listen to Rapi voice her concerns about her squadmates.
d_counseling_rapi_13_1,Have you ever imagined how it felt
d_counseling_rapi_13_2,to live in the old days?
d_counseling_rapi_13_3,I'm sure there was a greater sense of justice back then.
d_counseling_rapi_13_4,People probably led much safer lives back then.
d_counseling_rapi_13_5,I'm not so sure I agree with you there.
d_counseling_rapi_13_6,I'm fairly sure that unfairness pervaded many aspects of life even back in the day.
d_counseling_rapi_13_7,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_rapi_13_8,Not being constantly filled with doubt... not worrying whether or not they will even be a tomorrow...
d_counseling_rapi_13_9,The people back then didn't realize how lucky they were.
d_counseling_rapi_13_10,Rapi and I discovered some old footage of the before times.
d_counseling_rapi_14_1,"It's only fair to take turns doing the laundry, but"
d_counseling_rapi_14_2,Neon always uses such strong detergent.
d_counseling_rapi_14_3,How can I prevent this from happening?
d_counseling_rapi_14_4,Tell Neon that simply using extra-strength detergent won't actually make her any stronger.
d_counseling_rapi_14_5,Your already short skirt will end up becoming even shorter.
d_counseling_rapi_14_6,...
d_counseling_rapi_14_7,I'll be sure to relay that message to her.
d_counseling_rapi_14_8,...
d_counseling_rapi_14_9,"I see you've been following this issue with rapt attention as well, Commander."
d_counseling_rapi_14_10,Rapi and I talk about proper laundry methods.
d_counseling_rapi_15_1,"Commander, If we ever reclaim the surface, what's the first thing you would do?"
d_counseling_rapi_15_2,I'd go on a nice spring picnic outdoors.
d_counseling_rapi_15_3,I'd start looking for a job.
d_counseling_rapi_15_4,A picnic under the sun...
d_counseling_rapi_15_5,"It may not seem like much, but if you ask me, it's still worth fighting for."
d_counseling_rapi_15_6,That's very... practical of you.
d_counseling_rapi_15_7,So much so that it's kind of depressing.
d_counseling_rapi_15_8,Rapi and I imagined what the future would be like.
d_counseling_rapi_16_1,I happened to overhear some of the Nikkes talking about me.
d_counseling_rapi_16_2,Apparently they find me difficult to deal with.
d_counseling_rapi_16_3,"Do you feel that way as well, Commander?"
d_counseling_rapi_16_4,A little.
d_counseling_rapi_16_5,Not at all.
d_counseling_rapi_16_6,I see...
d_counseling_rapi_16_7,"I'll do what I can to try and change, but don't expect too much."
d_counseling_rapi_16_8,I see...
d_counseling_rapi_16_9,"Perfect, that's all I needed. Thank you."
d_counseling_rapi_16_10,Rapi and I hang out having fun with personality tests.
d_counseling_rapi_17_1,I have a personal matter I'd like to discuss with you.
d_counseling_rapi_17_2,Say you were to encounter someone from a past relationship.
d_counseling_rapi_17_3,How would you react?
d_counseling_rapi_17_4,I'd be honest about any potential feelings I still had for them.
d_counseling_rapi_17_5,I'd try to avoid them if I could.
d_counseling_rapi_17_6,You mean... my true feelings?
d_counseling_rapi_17_7,"You of all people know, I'm not exactly good with opening up about this kind of thing."
d_counseling_rapi_17_8,"But if the opportunity presents itself, I'll give it a shot."
d_counseling_rapi_17_9,Unfortunately...
d_counseling_rapi_17_10,"We're in the same organization, so I doubt I'll be able to avoid them forever."
d_counseling_rapi_17_11,I have a conversation with Rapi about her previous squad.
d_counseling_rapi_18_1,I'm curious about the time you spent at the Military Academy.
d_counseling_rapi_18_2,Do any memories from that time stand out to you?
d_counseling_rapi_18_3,"Sure, all the painful ones."
d_counseling_rapi_18_4,I don't remember much from that time.
d_counseling_rapi_18_5,I see...
d_counseling_rapi_18_6,"In that case, I admire your tenacity."
d_counseling_rapi_18_7,It's impressive that you overcame all of those obstacles to get where you are today.
d_counseling_rapi_18_8,People often repress traumatic or painful memories without even realizing it.
d_counseling_rapi_18_9,"I hope that's not the case for you, Commander."
d_counseling_rapi_18_10,I look back on my days of being a cadet and share what I can remember with Rapi.
d_counseling_rapi_19_1,I feel Neon and Anis have been stopping by your room too often.
d_counseling_rapi_19_2,"For the sake of your own privacy, wouldn't it be better if you set up some ground rules?"
d_counseling_rapi_19_3,"The more, the merrier."
d_counseling_rapi_19_4,"I'm only one person, I'm powerless to stop them."
d_counseling_rapi_19_5,...
d_counseling_rapi_19_6,I guess that settles it then.
d_counseling_rapi_19_7,I'll just leave it be for now.
d_counseling_rapi_19_8,...
d_counseling_rapi_19_9,"You're far too lenient with them, Commander."
d_counseling_rapi_19_10,Rapi and I have a discussion about privacy.
d_counseling_rapi_20_1,"Commander, you were born in the Ark, yet you fight up on the surface."
d_counseling_rapi_20_2,"Whenever the fight comes to an end, you come back to the Outpost."
d_counseling_rapi_20_3,Which of those locations means the most to you?
d_counseling_rapi_20_4,The surface.
d_counseling_rapi_20_5,The Outpost.
d_counseling_rapi_20_6,"Well, it is a place where we risk our lives"
d_counseling_rapi_20_7,trying to reclaim the surface myself included.
d_counseling_rapi_20_8,I'm not surprised you have such strong feelings for it.
d_counseling_rapi_20_9,...!!
d_counseling_rapi_20_10,"The Outpost may not be perfect,"
d_counseling_rapi_20_11,"but even taking all that into consideration, there are a lot of good memories here."
d_counseling_rapi_20_12,Perhaps it's those memories that make you cherish this place so much.
d_counseling_rapi_20_13,I have a conversation with Rapi about various places and what they mean to us.
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_1,I'm worried.
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_2,"For some reason, whenever I see you, all sorts of deep sexual desires keep surging up in my mind..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_3,Oh! Oh my...!
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_4,(Run away.)
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_5,We should go outside and get some fresh air.
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_6,"Wh-where are you going, Believer?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_7,"I need you to XXX me for...
No! I mean, I need you to counsel me for a long, long time!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_8,*Gasp* Outside?
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_9,"You want me to do th-that stuff out in the open, without walls or anything?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_10,How could you be so... so... so dirty!
d_counseling_rapunzel_01_11,I have a dangerous conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_1,"Sometimes, I can't help thinking about the past."
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_2,"I know it's meaningless to get hung up on the past, but I just can't help it!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_4,Just do your best to live in the present.
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_5,"Grieve as much as you want, then move on when you're ready."
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_6,That's a great answer.
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_7,"As I thought, you are a stronger person than me."
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_8,...!!
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_9,I thought you would tell me to be strong. Your advice is rather disappointing.
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_10,But... it actually makes me feel a little more relieved. Thank you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_02_11,I have a deep conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_1,Praying at the church supposedly cleanses the mind.
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_2,"But, I think it has the opposite effect on me."
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_3,Do you know why that could be?
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_4,Maybe you're too aware of your own immorality.
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_5,"No, and I don't want to know."
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_6,*Gasp* What are you saying?! You mean...?
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_7,"When you watch me pray, is that what you're thinking about?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_8,How can you be so immoral...! *Gasp*
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_9,"I swear, I'm not like that at all."
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_10,...
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_11,Aw. What a pity.
d_counseling_rapunzel_03_12,I listen to Rapunzel's serious concerns.
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_1,"Believer, I wonder..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_2,What kind of books do you like?
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_3,Erotic and romantic novels.
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_4,Overly passionate adventure novels.
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_5,R-romantic novels...
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_6,"A man and woman meet, tied to a tragic fate..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_7,"But on page two, they're already doing XXX? And by page three, it's XXX? You mean that kind of...?!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_8,Stop ruining my innocence.
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_9,... Overly passionate?
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_10,Hmm... I don't quite understand...
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_11,"Could you help me understand...
Exactly what kind of passionate things you're looking for?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_04_12,I have a dangerous conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_1,Believer...
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_2,"What is your fetis... I mean, what is your ideal type?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_3,A person who is true to their own desires.
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_4,A person who has great common sense.
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_5,That... that means...!
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_6,You like people who can honestly enjoy themselves in any situation?
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_7,... Wait. Isn't that me?
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_8,Th-... Um... That...
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_9,... is a hard place that I can never reach.
d_counseling_rapunzel_05_10,I discuss ideal types with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_1,"Believer, when you want something from someone else..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_2,Do you just ask politely? Or do you really go for what you want?
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_3,I make my desires known.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_4,I just ask politely.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_5,I see. You have good self-control.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_6,"But you should consider that maybe the other person... wants something, too!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_7,Ah. I-I see.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_8,"Do you just keep going, until you hear... the sounds of surrender?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_9,... I-incredible.
d_counseling_rapunzel_06_10,I have an odd conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_1,How is life in the Ark?
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_2,It's pretty great. I'm happy.
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_3,It's unbearable.
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_4,"... So you like it there, too."
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_5,You're the kind of optimist who sees everything as an opportunity.
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_6,That's definitely a blessing from God.
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_7,Ah...
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_8,It's at times like this that I must remind myself:
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_9,"Though everyone is suffering, it falls to us to reclaim the surface."
d_counseling_rapunzel_07_10,I have a deep conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_1,My hobby is writing novels.
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_2,"I'm almost done with one now, but I can't think of a proper ending."
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_3,"I need your help, Believer."
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_4,"""The friend who called me over was nowhere to be seen, but I could hear that water was running in the shower."""
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_5,"""Curious, I opened the shower door just a crack and peeked inside..."""
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_6,Stop! It's the A.C.P.U.!
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_7,Inside was an ancient king who's been sealed away for 2000 years.
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_8,Wow. That was a quick genre change.
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_9,"But, plot twists are all the rage these days..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_10,...
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_11,"That's right. If it was trapped somewhere for 2000 years, I'd want a shower, too, before I..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_08_12,I discuss novels with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_1,"Believer, do you believe in the existence of the soul?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_2,Do you think we Nikkes have souls as well?
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_3,I don't believe in souls.
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_4,I think Nikkes must have them.
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_5,... Got it.
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_6,But I still want to believe in them.
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_7,Haha. There may be no proof...
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_8,"But, I hold the same opinion."
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_9,"To be exact, I really hope we do."
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_10,I hope we're more than just machines...
d_counseling_rapunzel_09_11,I have a conversation with Rapunzel on a serious topic.
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_1,"Believer, do lead with the lips or the tongue?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_2,... What?
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_3,... Depends on the other person.
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_4,"Haha! I'm talking about when you eat, of course."
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_5,Oh! Were you... thinking of something else?
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_6,Then... can you tell me your answer for the other thing as well?
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_7,Huh? Other person?
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_8,What other person? I'm just talking about eating.
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_9,What's going on in your head to make you say something like that?
d_counseling_rapunzel_10_10,I spend time talking about useless things with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_1,"Whenever you're walking up on the surface and glance up at the sky,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_2,you can see all kinds of clouds floating around.
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_3,"Some are shaped like rabbits, some like hearts, and others..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_4,Gasp!
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_5,What? What do you see?
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_6,It's a cloud... shaped like a gasp?
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_7,"So you're curious, are you?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_8,Allow me to explain it to you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_9,Lean in a little bit closer.
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_10,What a peculiar shape.
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_11,"Tell me, what does it look like?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_11_12,I have a conversation with Rapunzel about various types of clouds.
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_1,"Believer, my heart is heavy today."
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_2,... Can you pray with me for all of the sisters that we lost?
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_3,Pray without saying a word.
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_4,Ask what is going on.
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_5,...
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_6,Thank you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_8,Well...
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_9,It might be a long story.
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_10,Would it be possible to pray first?
d_counseling_rapunzel_12_11,I pray together with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_1,What a tranquil place this is.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_2,It's worlds apart from the rest of the surface.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_3,Let's live here together.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_4,One day the surface will be like this. I'll make it so.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_5,"You mean to live together, and do everything together?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_6,"When you want something, you really just go for it!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_7,But in all seriousness...
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_8,"I appreciate the offer, but I can't do that."
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_9,"If anyone can make that a reality,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_10,it's you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_11,I'll be by your side protecting you the entire way.
d_counseling_rapunzel_13_12,Rapunzel and I both envisioned bringing peace back to the surface.
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_1,"I hear that once people establish a rapport, they often give each other nicknames."
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_2,How about we do the same?
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_3,Gaspunzel.
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_4,Honey.
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_5,"Hmm... I like it,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_6,but are you sure it's not too hard for you to pronounce?
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_7,!!
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_8,"Is that the same ""Honey"" that I'm thinking of?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_9,"As in, ""Hey Honey, it's our honeymoon""? That kind of thing?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_10,I didn't realize you wanted to take our relationship to the next level!
d_counseling_rapunzel_14_11,I spend some time with Rapunzel coming up with unique nicknames.
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_1,"I'm so booooored. How about we play First Letter, Last Letter?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_2,Chef
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_3,Fervor.
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_4,Fond.
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_5,R... what's a word that starts with R...
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_7,"Ah, Rendezvous!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_8,Hey!
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_9,Are you saying you're fond of me?
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_10,"Since we're more than just acquaintances now, does that mean you're thinking of taking me and..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_15_11,"I spend some time with Rapunzel playing First Letter, Last Letter."
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_1,I enjoy spending time with you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_2,I don't want to forget a single second of it.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_3,Let's keep creating new memories.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_4,I'll remember all of it as well.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_5,"Yes, let's do that!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_6,The thought of us continue to create new memories
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_7,makes me happier than you can imagine.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_8,I am confident that you will.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_9,"But in the end, I will not."
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_10,"The lone survivor... the last one left behind... what a sad, lonely fate."
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_11,I hope such a fate never befalls you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_16_12,Rapunzel and I share some of our memories.
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_1,"While wandering up on the surface,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_2,I found this beautiful area where you can see flowers as far as the eye can see.
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_3,I'd love to see it for myself.
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_4,Is there really such a place up on the surface?
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_5,"If we ever manage to get things straightened out up on the surface,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_6,I'll take you there one day. Promise.
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_7,"It's so beautiful, it'll bring tears to your eyes."
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_8,"Of course, more than you think."
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_9,"All of you ever see of the surface is battle and bloodshed,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_10,but I see it in all of its variegated splendor.
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_11,"One day, I hope I can show you some of the things I've seen."
d_counseling_rapunzel_17_12,Rapunzel and I discuss how beautiful the surface can be.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_1,"I went to the library a few days ago, and there were so many good books to choose from."
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_2,Do you visit the library frequently?
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_3,I've read most of their entire book collection at this point.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_4,I'm not a big reader.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_5,!!
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_6,"Then have you read ""XX plus X equals...""?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_7,"It was so incredibly... descriptive, don't you think?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_8,That's too bad.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_9,Reading helps calm your mind.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_10,I think reading once in a while could be good for you.
d_counseling_rapunzel_18_11,Rapunzel and I talk more about reading.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_1,"Believer, do you own anything that has sentimental value, but no practical usage?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_2,Sure I do.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_3,No.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_4,"During my wanderings up on the surface, I find all sorts of knick-knacks."
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_5,"When I think of how much they must have meant to other people,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_6,I can't help but grow attached to them.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_7,As I expected.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_8,I think it is a good idea for you to find something like that.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_9,Small things like that can be a kind of tether keeping you connected to our world.
d_counseling_rapunzel_19_10,Rapunzel and I share a deep conversation.
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_1,Scarlet is so good at whistling a tune. I find it fascinating.
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_2,Are you any good at whistling?
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_3,Yes.
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_4,No.
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_5,Then can you teach me?
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_6,"Every time I hear Scarlet whistling, I get so jealous!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_7,"Close your lips like this, then curl your tongue."
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_8,!!
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_9,Close my lips like this...
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_10,... and then what? Fffffssssss...
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_11,I'm hopeless when it comes to whistling as well.
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_12,"Next time I see Scarlet, I'll ask her to teach me."
d_counseling_rapunzel_20_13,Rapunzel and I discuss the fine art of whistling.
d_counseling_rupee_01_1,"Hey, I'm curious. If there was something Sweetie wanted really really badly,"
d_counseling_rupee_01_2,"but you already had one at home, what would you do?"
d_counseling_rupee_01_3,It doesn't matter. I buy everything I want.
d_counseling_rupee_01_4,A penny saved is a penny earned.
d_counseling_rupee_01_5,"Right? You think so, too?"
d_counseling_rupee_01_6,"Then, I'm going to purchase it right away! Hehe!"
d_counseling_rupee_01_7,B-but...
d_counseling_rupee_01_8,Even if you'll be dreaming about it for at least a week...?
d_counseling_rupee_01_9,Ugh...
d_counseling_rupee_01_10,I talk to Rupee about proper spending habits.
d_counseling_rupee_02_1,S-Sweetie...
d_counseling_rupee_02_2,Something weird is happening to me these days.
d_counseling_rupee_02_3,"I make billions every month... But when I actually look at my bank account, it's always empty..."
d_counseling_rupee_02_4,Because you spend everything you earn.
d_counseling_rupee_02_5,That is such a scary story.
d_counseling_rupee_02_6,!!
d_counseling_rupee_02_7,R-really?
d_counseling_rupee_02_8,Oh! I think I'm getting a headache...
d_counseling_rupee_02_9,Right?
d_counseling_rupee_02_10,I find it so weird and creepy that I can't sleep well these days.
d_counseling_rupee_02_11,I counsel Rupee about the strange happenings.
d_counseling_rupee_03_1,"Hey, Sweetie..."
d_counseling_rupee_03_2,By any chance...
d_counseling_rupee_03_3,Do you have some time this weekend?
d_counseling_rupee_03_4,I'm busy.
d_counseling_rupee_03_5,Of course.
d_counseling_rupee_03_6,"Hm, I see..."
d_counseling_rupee_03_7,That's too bad.
d_counseling_rupee_03_8,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_rupee_03_9,"Then, would you like to go to Royal Road with me?"
d_counseling_rupee_03_10,I don't have designs on you or anything...
d_counseling_rupee_03_11,I just... thought it would be nice to spend some time together.
d_counseling_rupee_03_12,I have a normal conversation with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_04_1,Hm hm~ Hm hm hm~
d_counseling_rupee_04_2,"Hey, Sweetie. Notice anything different about me today?"
d_counseling_rupee_04_3,Are those new heels?
d_counseling_rupee_04_4,(Keep silent.)
d_counseling_rupee_04_5,Oh! You noticed right away!
d_counseling_rupee_04_6,Incredible...!
d_counseling_rupee_04_7,...
d_counseling_rupee_04_8,... S-sorry. I asked a stupid question.
d_counseling_rupee_04_9,I engage in psychological warfare with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_05_1,Is there any way to make money without working?
d_counseling_rupee_05_2,Stop dreaming. Just work hard.
d_counseling_rupee_05_3,Invest in real estate or stocks...
d_counseling_rupee_05_4,Argh!!
d_counseling_rupee_05_5,Th-that's such a ruthless answer!
d_counseling_rupee_05_6,"Hmm, I'm already doing that."
d_counseling_rupee_05_7,But my earnings have not kept pace with my spending.
d_counseling_rupee_05_8,I talk to Rupee about unearned income.
d_counseling_rupee_06_1,S-Sweetie...
d_counseling_rupee_06_2,Yan and Dolla always think I'm stupid.
d_counseling_rupee_06_3,"They say I should be investing my earnings, not spending it all..."
d_counseling_rupee_06_4,They are right.
d_counseling_rupee_06_5,Money exists to be spent!
d_counseling_rupee_06_6,I can't believe you betrayed me!
d_counseling_rupee_06_7,What a shock!
d_counseling_rupee_06_8,You think so?
d_counseling_rupee_06_9,"No matter how I think about it, I know I'm right."
d_counseling_rupee_06_10,"As I thought, Yan and Dolla were wrong! Haha!"
d_counseling_rupee_06_11,I talk with Rupee about her squad mates.
d_counseling_rupee_07_1,I've really started enjoying running the mall recently.
d_counseling_rupee_07_2,What should I put on the main banner this week?
d_counseling_rupee_07_3,The product that sells best.
d_counseling_rupee_07_4,A product with unrealized potential.
d_counseling_rupee_07_5,Hmm... That's the way it's usually done.
d_counseling_rupee_07_6,"But if I keep emphasizing the products that are already selling well,"
d_counseling_rupee_07_7,customers might get bored with the same products over and over again.
d_counseling_rupee_07_8,Hmm... That might be a gamble.
d_counseling_rupee_07_9,"But, I also think it's a good way to open up some new possibilities!"
d_counseling_rupee_07_10,"The customers won't get tired, and the suppliers will be able to try a fresh approach."
d_counseling_rupee_07_11,I have an in-depth conversation with Rupee about running a shopping mall.
d_counseling_rupee_08_1,Sweetie.
d_counseling_rupee_08_2,There is one big problem with you.
d_counseling_rupee_08_3,Do you know what it is?
d_counseling_rupee_08_4,That I don't spend mindlessly?
d_counseling_rupee_08_5,What is that?
d_counseling_rupee_08_6,That's ri...!
d_counseling_rupee_08_7,"N-no, I almost fell for it."
d_counseling_rupee_08_8,Hmm... That's not what I'm talking about.
d_counseling_rupee_08_9,"Oh, no... Seems like you have no idea."
d_counseling_rupee_08_10,Then let me tell you. Your problem is...
d_counseling_rupee_08_11,Model's body! Handsome face!
d_counseling_rupee_08_12,"You were born with all this, but you don't dress well at all."
d_counseling_rupee_08_13,It's a sin! A sin against all the girls in the Ark who dream of love!
d_counseling_rupee_08_14,Conclusion. You need to go shopping with me today.
d_counseling_rupee_08_15,I get dragged away by Rupee and end up shopping all day.
d_counseling_rupee_09_1,"You know, Sweetie."
d_counseling_rupee_09_2,"This might sound like a useless question, but..."
d_counseling_rupee_09_3,What type of pattern do you think is the most beautiful in the world?
d_counseling_rupee_09_4,Leopard print.
d_counseling_rupee_09_5,Zebra print.
d_counseling_rupee_09_6,...!!
d_counseling_rupee_09_7,We are soulmates from now on.
d_counseling_rupee_09_8,Umm...
d_counseling_rupee_09_9,That... Uh...
d_counseling_rupee_09_10,I see.
d_counseling_rupee_09_11,I talk to Rupee about aesthetics.
d_counseling_rupee_10_1,I'm curious. What's at the top of your bucket list?
d_counseling_rupee_10_2,"For me of course, items 1 through 10 are all luxury goods."
d_counseling_rupee_10_3,"But, I figure someone like you would have a very different bucket list than I do."
d_counseling_rupee_10_4,Ensuring the safety of innocent people.
d_counseling_rupee_10_5,Reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_rupee_10_6,... Ah.
d_counseling_rupee_10_7,"How can you be so cool, even when you're just talking about your bucket list?"
d_counseling_rupee_10_8,"... Hmm, as I thought."
d_counseling_rupee_10_9,"Still, the fact that the most important wish is not something for yourself..."
d_counseling_rupee_10_10,"I don't know if I should say it's sad, or if it's honorable."
d_counseling_rupee_10_11,I talk about wishes with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_11_1,Rupee has her head buried in her phone.
d_counseling_rupee_11_2,...
d_counseling_rupee_11_3,Are you talking to your boyfriend?
d_counseling_rupee_11_4,Trying to get your hands on a limited edition item?
d_counseling_rupee_11_5,Huh?
d_counseling_rupee_11_6,"N-no! I'd never betray you like that, Sweetie! They released some limited edition shoes, so I'm..."
d_counseling_rupee_11_7,Aw man! Missed it.
d_counseling_rupee_11_8,"Yeah, these shoes originally came out 5 years ago, and they were out of this world."
d_counseling_rupee_11_9,Now everyone's clamoring to get a pair. There's only a 1 in 500 chance of snagging some.
d_counseling_rupee_11_10,But guess who got a pair? You're looking at her!
d_counseling_rupee_11_11,Rupee teaches me how to purchase limited edition items.
d_counseling_rupee_12_1,"Sweetie, where do you spend your money?"
d_counseling_rupee_12_2,Do you even spend money?
d_counseling_rupee_12_3,I don't think I've ever seen you spend a single credit.
d_counseling_rupee_12_4,I do a bit of spending here and there whenever I need something.
d_counseling_rupee_12_5,I prefer to save up.
d_counseling_rupee_12_6,"Oh, do you?"
d_counseling_rupee_12_7,So you don't plan out your expenses in advance...
d_counseling_rupee_12_8,You're just like me!
d_counseling_rupee_12_9,Are you kidding?
d_counseling_rupee_12_10,"We don't even know if this world will be here tomorrow, and you're saving up?"
d_counseling_rupee_12_11,Hmm... You and I have totally different mindsets. That's unfortunate.
d_counseling_rupee_12_12,Rupee and I share our differing philosophies on spending habits.
d_counseling_rupee_13_1,Breaking news! This is huge!
d_counseling_rupee_13_2,"Kylie and Ashe are getting married! They were airing out their dirty laundry for all to see before, so it must have been all for a show!"
d_counseling_rupee_13_3,Isn't that crazy?!
d_counseling_rupee_13_4,... Who are these people?
d_counseling_rupee_13_5,You're kidding! I'm totally obsessed with Ashe.
d_counseling_rupee_13_6,Wha... You don't know?
d_counseling_rupee_13_7,Kylie is a movie star and Ashe is a singer!
d_counseling_rupee_13_8,They first met while filming a movie and have been at each other's throats ever since...
d_counseling_rupee_13_9,I'm a massive Kylie fangirl!
d_counseling_rupee_13_10,...
d_counseling_rupee_13_11,"Erm, just a fan I mean. Nothing more than that."
d_counseling_rupee_13_12,"What about you, Sweetie? Are you just a fan, or are you attracted to Ashe?"
d_counseling_rupee_13_13,Rupee and I talk about celebrity gossip.
d_counseling_rupee_14_1,Something's been on my mind.
d_counseling_rupee_14_2,"Dolla and Yan invited me to separate events, but they're being held at the same time and in opposite directions."
d_counseling_rupee_14_3,They'll feel bad if I stand them up... Which one should I attend?
d_counseling_rupee_14_4,You should hold your own event.
d_counseling_rupee_14_5,Don't go to either event.
d_counseling_rupee_14_6,!!
d_counseling_rupee_14_7,You're a genius! I'll hold my own event at the same time
d_counseling_rupee_14_8,and send them both an invitation!
d_counseling_rupee_14_9,Are you sure?
d_counseling_rupee_14_10,What if I end up upsetting both of them?
d_counseling_rupee_14_11,I can't do that. I have to think about it some more.
d_counseling_rupee_14_12,I talk with Rupee and we discuss how beneficial it would be to have two bodies.
d_counseling_rupee_15_1,This isn't good.
d_counseling_rupee_15_2,Viewership is down at the shopaholic channel.
d_counseling_rupee_15_3,I need to invite a guest that'll create some attention. Who do you think would be good?
d_counseling_rupee_15_4,Invite Syuen.
d_counseling_rupee_15_5,Invite Mustang.
d_counseling_rupee_15_6,The boss?
d_counseling_rupee_15_7,That would certainly create some buzz...
d_counseling_rupee_15_8,But she's a loose cannon. I don't want a guest I can't control.
d_counseling_rupee_15_9,"Yes, that's it!"
d_counseling_rupee_15_10,Why didn't I think of that?
d_counseling_rupee_15_11,"He'll be more than happy to come on, and lots of viewers will tune in."
d_counseling_rupee_15_12,He's a perfect fit for the show as well.
d_counseling_rupee_15_13,I spend time with Rupee planning out her show.
d_counseling_rupee_16_1,"Sweetie, how do you feel when you watch rich people go on a spending spree?"
d_counseling_rupee_16_2,I find it therapeutic.
d_counseling_rupee_16_3,I get nothing out of it.
d_counseling_rupee_16_4,Hehe. I'm glad.
d_counseling_rupee_16_5,I was hoping you'd feel that way.
d_counseling_rupee_16_6,My hope is that my viewers can take a load off their minds by watching me spend.
d_counseling_rupee_16_7,"Oh, so that's how you feel..."
d_counseling_rupee_16_8,My hope is that my viewers can take a load off their minds by watching me spend.
d_counseling_rupee_16_9,But things seldom turn out the way we want them to.
d_counseling_rupee_16_10,I have a conversation with Rupee about how people perceive things.
d_counseling_rupee_17_1,Sniff...Sniff..!
d_counseling_rupee_17_2,Uhhhhhhh..!!
d_counseling_rupee_17_3,Sweetie!
d_counseling_rupee_17_4,"Here, let me lend you my shoulder to cry on."
d_counseling_rupee_17_5,I'm sure you'll get the next limited edition... whatever it was.
d_counseling_rupee_17_6,Sniff!!
d_counseling_rupee_17_7,"Thank you, but..."
d_counseling_rupee_17_8,That won't help me get the next limited edition earrings!
d_counseling_rupee_17_9,I can't believe this...!
d_counseling_rupee_17_10,I missed out on the limited edition earrings all because I forgot to update the app! What a rookie mistake!
d_counseling_rupee_17_11,Next time...! Next time...!
d_counseling_rupee_17_12,Wahhhh-!!
d_counseling_rupee_17_13,I spend time comforting Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_18_1,I just thought of a question I wanted to ask.
d_counseling_rupee_18_2,Do you remember the name of my clothing brand?
d_counseling_rupee_18_3,Rusae.
d_counseling_rupee_18_4,Rushamalamadingdong?
d_counseling_rupee_18_5,Bingo!
d_counseling_rupee_18_6,I know how much you adore me. I should have known that would be a cinch for you.
d_counseling_rupee_18_7,... Are you possessed or something?
d_counseling_rupee_18_11,I spend time chatting with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_19_1,Every once in a while I run into haters on my vlog.
d_counseling_rupee_19_2,One of them turned out to be one of my VIPs! They used a different account to harass me.
d_counseling_rupee_19_3,"Dolla resolved it for me, so it's all good now, but..."
d_counseling_rupee_19_4,Why would someone do such a thing?
d_counseling_rupee_19_5,There's no reason. Haters gonna hate.
d_counseling_rupee_19_6,"They just hate us, 'cause they aint us."
d_counseling_rupee_19_7,Hmm... I don't think that's it.
d_counseling_rupee_19_8,"I mean, they liked my products enough to become a VIP."
d_counseling_rupee_19_9,There has to be a reason behind it.
d_counseling_rupee_19_10,I think you may be onto something.
d_counseling_rupee_19_11,They bought all of the products I used to wear as a model.
d_counseling_rupee_19_12,...
d_counseling_rupee_19_13,I think they should know that everyone has their own charm.
d_counseling_rupee_19_14,Rupee and I have a conversation about haters.
d_counseling_rupee_20_1,"Sweetie, how's it hanging?"
d_counseling_rupee_20_2,Catch ya on the flip side!
d_counseling_rupee_20_3,What on earth is going on?
d_counseling_rupee_20_4,... Who is this?
d_counseling_rupee_20_5,"Haha, you're so adorable when you're confused!"
d_counseling_rupee_20_6,"I'm trying out some new slang, what do you think?"
d_counseling_rupee_20_7,"Totally rad, right my dude? Hehehe!"
d_counseling_rupee_20_8,"It's me, Rupee!"
d_counseling_rupee_20_9,I thought I'd try out some new slang.
d_counseling_rupee_20_10,Rupee and I have fun trying out some new slang.
d_counseling_signal_01_1,"Commander, no matter how I look at it, Delta seems so friendly and thoughtful."
d_counseling_signal_01_2,"But, everybody else says she's not."
d_counseling_signal_01_3,"What about you, Commander? What do you think of her?"
d_counseling_signal_01_4,"Delta is many things, but 'thoughtful' isn't one of them."
d_counseling_signal_01_5,"I think she's a good person as well, and very friendly."
d_counseling_signal_01_6,!!
d_counseling_signal_01_7,I-I'm sorry!
d_counseling_signal_01_8,I didn't realize you felt the same way everybody else does.
d_counseling_signal_01_9,That's right!
d_counseling_signal_01_10,I knew you'd feel the same way that I do!
d_counseling_signal_01_11,I'm glad. I was starting to think I needed to get my eyes checked.
d_counseling_signal_01_12,Signal tells me about all of Delta's positive qualities.
d_counseling_signal_02_1,C-Commander... I completed my mission...
d_counseling_signal_02_2,Is it okay if I watch an episode of my TV show?
d_counseling_signal_02_3,Would... would I get in trouble if I did?
d_counseling_signal_02_4,Darn right you'd be in trouble.
d_counseling_signal_02_5,You won't be in trouble.
d_counseling_signal_02_6,I knew it...
d_counseling_signal_02_7,"It's the series finale, so I really wanted to see it right when it aired."
d_counseling_signal_02_8,"But, I understand..."
d_counseling_signal_02_9,R-really?!
d_counseling_signal_02_10,It's the series finale! I've been dying to see it.
d_counseling_signal_02_11,Thank you so much!
d_counseling_signal_02_12,I have a pleasant conversation about TV shows with Signal.
d_counseling_signal_03_1,"C-Commander, if you were in a relationship, what kind of relationship would you like to be in?"
d_counseling_signal_03_2,"I'd want it to be a relationship full of passion, like the ones on TV."
d_counseling_signal_03_3,"I'm an adult, so I would like to be in an adult relationship."
d_counseling_signal_03_4,Of course!
d_counseling_signal_03_5,"Me, too. It's my dream to be in a relationship just like the ones in the romantic dramas."
d_counseling_signal_03_6,An... adult relationship?
d_counseling_signal_03_7,I-I understand...
d_counseling_signal_03_8,Adult... could I be considered an adult?
d_counseling_signal_03_9,I have a conversation with Signal about romantic relationships.
d_counseling_signal_04_1,"Commander, this is only a hypothetical question, but..."
d_counseling_signal_04_2,"If you could take time off right now,"
d_counseling_signal_04_3,would you rather stay home or go out?
d_counseling_signal_04_4,"I'd spend my free time outside, where there are lots of fun things to do."
d_counseling_signal_04_5,I'd have a staycation at home and binge watch all my favorite shows.
d_counseling_signal_04_6,I-I see.
d_counseling_signal_04_7,I thought you might have enjoyed staying home...
d_counseling_signal_04_8,"W-well, thank you for answering my question."
d_counseling_signal_04_9,"You're so right, Commander!"
d_counseling_signal_04_10,"If you stay home, there are so many shows that you could binge!"
d_counseling_signal_04_11,It's the perfect way to use your vacation time!
d_counseling_signal_04_12,Signal and I go on making plans for our imaginary vacation.
d_counseling_signal_05_1,Commander... Wh-what... exactly is your type?
d_counseling_signal_05_2,I-I don't mean anything by it. I... I was just curious.
d_counseling_signal_05_3,Honestly!
d_counseling_signal_05_4,Are you sure it's just simple curiosity?
d_counseling_signal_05_5,Someone I can watch my favorite shows with.
d_counseling_signal_05_6,Eep! Forget I said anything!
d_counseling_signal_05_7,Just pretend I never asked!
d_counseling_signal_05_8,!!
d_counseling_signal_05_9,"R-really? You're not pulling my leg, are you?"
d_counseling_signal_05_10,"Even if it is a joke, just hearing you say it makes me happy!"
d_counseling_signal_05_11,"I calm down Signal, who is blushing a bright red."
d_counseling_signal_06_1,Commander... Y-you have to tell me the truth...
d_counseling_signal_06_2,Are you in any pain?
d_counseling_signal_06_3,There's been nothing but pain in my entire life.
d_counseling_signal_06_4,Is the protagonist on your TV show terminally ill?
d_counseling_signal_06_5,What?!
d_counseling_signal_06_6,"Please tell me you're joking! That's not actually true, is it?"
d_counseling_signal_06_7,T-tell me it's not true. We need to get you to a hospital at once!
d_counseling_signal_06_8,How did you...?!
d_counseling_signal_06_9,"You're so perceptive, Commander."
d_counseling_signal_06_10,"With that kind of insight, you probably know what type of diseases you yourself have."
d_counseling_signal_06_11,I have a conversation with Signal about health management.
d_counseling_signal_07_1,"Hey... Today, when I woke up,"
d_counseling_signal_07_2,I was on the opposite side of the bed from where I fell asleep.
d_counseling_signal_07_3,Do you think something happened to me last night?
d_counseling_signal_07_4,There might have been a thief.
d_counseling_signal_07_5,You probably danced in your sleep.
d_counseling_signal_07_6,A th-thief?!
d_counseling_signal_07_7,"But, there's nothing in my room worth stealing!"
d_counseling_signal_07_8,I thought it was just my own weird sleeping habits... I never thought a crime would be involved...
d_counseling_signal_07_9,This is all making me very anxious...
d_counseling_signal_07_10,"Hey! Now that you mention it, I think I did have a dream like that!"
d_counseling_signal_07_11,"Anyway, as long as nobody else came into my room or anything, I'm happy."
d_counseling_signal_07_12,Thank you for putting my mind at ease!
d_counseling_signal_07_13,I have a conversation with Signal about sleeping habits.
d_counseling_signal_08_1,I've decided.
d_counseling_signal_08_2,"Starting today, I'm going to focus more on myself."
d_counseling_signal_08_3,I'm going to become a career-driven woman.
d_counseling_signal_08_4,So... W-with that being said...
d_counseling_signal_08_5,"Can I dress in office attire, starting tomorrow?"
d_counseling_signal_08_6,"Yes, you can."
d_counseling_signal_08_7,Are you sure Delta will be okay with this?
d_counseling_signal_08_8,I can't believe you agreed to it so quickly!
d_counseling_signal_08_9,So... why do I feel so anxious?
d_counseling_signal_08_10,I feel like I'm missing something important...
d_counseling_signal_08_11,!!
d_counseling_signal_08_12,"Oh, right. Delta will never agree. I'll get in trouble for sure..."
d_counseling_signal_08_13,*Sigh* I guess I'll just give up now.
d_counseling_signal_08_14,"Thank you for reminding me, Commander."
d_counseling_signal_08_15,Signal and I talk about what it means to be a career woman.
d_counseling_signal_09_1,I really hate it when it rains before a mission.
d_counseling_signal_09_2,"But, I like the rain when I'm indoors."
d_counseling_signal_09_3,"What do you think about rain, Commander?"
d_counseling_signal_09_4,I enjoy the rain. I find it very atmospheric.
d_counseling_signal_09_5,"I despise the rain, especially during combat."
d_counseling_signal_09_6,I feel the same way!
d_counseling_signal_09_7,The romantic sound of the raindrops really makes me feel like I'm living in a TV show...
d_counseling_signal_09_8,I'm so glad we feel the same way.
d_counseling_signal_09_9,"O-oh, right!"
d_counseling_signal_09_10,"Yeah, it's totally the worst, especially during combat..."
d_counseling_signal_09_11,I have a conversation with Signal about the rain.
d_counseling_signal_10_1,I... watched a show yesterday.
d_counseling_signal_10_2,"It said that when you look at the Ark from the surface elevator,"
d_counseling_signal_10_3,it sparkles like starlight in the night sky.
d_counseling_signal_10_4,"Do you think that's true, Commander?"
d_counseling_signal_10_5,I think it's true.
d_counseling_signal_10_6,The night sky is prettier up on the surface.
d_counseling_signal_10_7,So I'm not the only one!
d_counseling_signal_10_8,"Of course, the night sky would be even prettier up on the surface..."
d_counseling_signal_10_9,But I love this show's dialogue. It's so dramatic!
d_counseling_signal_10_10,"I-I don't disagree, but..."
d_counseling_signal_10_11,don't you think it's such a dramatic metaphor?
d_counseling_signal_10_12,"I-if you don't think so, that's fine, too..."
d_counseling_signal_10_13,Signal and I talk about the beauty of the Ark.
d_counseling_signal_11_1,I was wondering...
d_counseling_signal_11_2,"If you ever ran into an actor from your favorite TV show,"
d_counseling_signal_11_3,would you say hi?
d_counseling_signal_11_4,I absolutely would. I'd even try to get an autograph.
d_counseling_signal_11_5,I'd just stare from a distance as they passed by.
d_counseling_signal_11_6,Are you sure they'd be okay with that?
d_counseling_signal_11_7,"But then again, it may be best to seize the opportunity when it presents itself."
d_counseling_signal_11_8,Quite the conundrum...
d_counseling_signal_11_9,"Yeah, if you came out of nowhere to say hello, you may freak them out."
d_counseling_signal_11_10,"I've been binging TV shows every day, so I'll just have to settle for seeing them on the screen."
d_counseling_signal_11_11,It would be nice to have a chance to meet some of the actors in person...
d_counseling_signal_11_12,Signal and I fantasize about meeting our favorite actors in the flesh.
d_counseling_signal_12_1,"I bought a doll from the toy store, but"
d_counseling_signal_12_2,I think it looks a bit childish.
d_counseling_signal_12_3,What do you think?
d_counseling_signal_12_4,It's adorable.
d_counseling_signal_12_5,It's not my style.
d_counseling_signal_12_6,I didn't know you liked this kind of style!
d_counseling_signal_12_7,I thought I was the only one who found it cute...
d_counseling_signal_12_8,Are there any other designs that you like?
d_counseling_signal_12_9,I figured it wouldn't be to your preference...
d_counseling_signal_12_10,"Next time, I'll try and buy something a little more sophisticated."
d_counseling_signal_12_11,I have a conversation with Signal about doll designs.
d_counseling_signal_13_1,"Commander, would it be possible for me to have 3 days off?"
d_counseling_signal_13_2,Since our last mission was a success and all...
d_counseling_signal_13_3,This new show I've been looking forward to premieres tonight.
d_counseling_signal_13_4,What's the show about?
d_counseling_signal_13_5,"Sure, you deserve a little R&R."
d_counseling_signal_13_6,It's about a young woman and the innocence of her first love.
d_counseling_signal_13_7,"It's got an amazing cast, so everyone's been looking forward to it."
d_counseling_signal_13_8,Are you interested in seeing it?
d_counseling_signal_13_9,Thank you!
d_counseling_signal_13_10,Um...
d_counseling_signal_13_11,Aren't you curious about what the show is about?
d_counseling_signal_13_12,Signal and I talk about the new TV show that's about to premiere.
d_counseling_signal_14_1,There are times when we need to file a complaint against a store.
d_counseling_signal_14_2,I always have a hard time saying anything because I'm afraid of hurting the other person's feelings.
d_counseling_signal_14_3,"If it were you, Commander, how would you handle it?"
d_counseling_signal_14_4,I would be direct and tell them exactly what my issues are.
d_counseling_signal_14_5,I would try to hint at what my issues are.
d_counseling_signal_14_6,"S-so I should be as direct as possible, right?"
d_counseling_signal_14_7,"That way, they'll know where I stand right off the bat..."
d_counseling_signal_14_8,But it's so hard!
d_counseling_signal_14_9,"Funny, I had you pegged as someone who'd prefer the direct approach."
d_counseling_signal_14_10,"Even if I only allude to it, I should be able to get my point across in the end, right?"
d_counseling_signal_14_11,"Not only that, but the person on the other end won't feel as bad."
d_counseling_signal_14_12,I have a conversation with Signal about ways of speaking to others.
d_counseling_signal_15_1,I heard that music can be an indicator of a person's mood and personality.
d_counseling_signal_15_2,"Commander, what kind of music do you usually listen to?"
d_counseling_signal_15_3,"The Waiting on Love OST, the first track."
d_counseling_signal_15_4,This death metal band called Kill Your Darlings.
d_counseling_signal_15_5,O-oh my gosh!
d_counseling_signal_15_6,That's the music that plays when the two actors first meet!
d_counseling_signal_15_7,Track 6 is also really good. Have you heard it?
d_counseling_signal_15_8,"Oh, so you like heavy metal?"
d_counseling_signal_15_9,I'm not too familiar with that genre...
d_counseling_signal_15_10,But I'll give it a listen whenever I have the chance!
d_counseling_signal_15_11,Signal and I discuss our taste in music.
d_counseling_signal_16_1,"Hello, Commander..."
d_counseling_signal_16_2,"... Never mind, it's nothing."
d_counseling_signal_16_3,That show you've been watching is starting soon. You can leave early today.
d_counseling_signal_16_4,Understood.
d_counseling_signal_16_5,!!
d_counseling_signal_16_6,How did you know? Do you watch it too?
d_counseling_signal_16_7,I promise all of my work is done! Thank you!
d_counseling_signal_16_8,Very well...
d_counseling_signal_16_9,"It seems like Signal has something she wants to say, but can't."
d_counseling_signal_16_10,Comman... Sigh. It's nothing.
d_counseling_signal_16_11,Signal and I ended our discussion early.
d_counseling_signal_17_1,I had a dream about being in a relationship. It all seemed so real.
d_counseling_signal_17_2,It would be nice if I could meet that person who was in my dreams someday...
d_counseling_signal_17_3,I'm sure one day your dream will become a reality.
d_counseling_signal_17_4,"Well, dreams are by definition the opposite of reality."
d_counseling_signal_17_5,You really think my dream will come true?
d_counseling_signal_17_6,I certainly hope so. We went on an amazing date!
d_counseling_signal_17_7,I hope that person shows up again in my dream tonight. Hehe.
d_counseling_signal_17_8,"If that's true, that's so sad..."
d_counseling_signal_17_9,We went on an amazing date in my dream.
d_counseling_signal_17_10,Signal and I talk about dreams.
d_counseling_signal_18_1,What should I do if I feel resentment towards one of my squadmates?
d_counseling_signal_18_2,What did Delta do this time?
d_counseling_signal_18_3,You should let them know. Don't keep it bottled up inside.
d_counseling_signal_18_4,Wh-what?!
d_counseling_signal_18_5,"I was just curious, that's all. It's got nothing to do with Delta!"
d_counseling_signal_18_6,Please don't tell her any of this!
d_counseling_signal_18_7,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_signal_18_8,I can't keep everything bottled up inside forever.
d_counseling_signal_18_9,One of these days I'm going to say something!
d_counseling_signal_18_10,Signal and I have a short chat.
d_counseling_signal_19_1,"Commander, have you ever been to a flower garden?"
d_counseling_signal_19_2,"I saw one once in a TV show, and it looked absolutely gorgeous."
d_counseling_signal_19_3,I'd love to visit one for real someday.
d_counseling_signal_19_4,"Actually, you could say I'm in a flower garden right now."
d_counseling_signal_19_5,"Yes, I've been to one before."
d_counseling_signal_19_6,Huh? But where are the flowers... Wait... a-are you saying I'm the flower?!
d_counseling_signal_19_7,"Gah! Commander, where is this coming from?!"
d_counseling_signal_19_8,"Wow, so you've actually been to one before?"
d_counseling_signal_19_9,Who did you go with? They're usually meant to be date spots...
d_counseling_signal_19_10,Signal and I talk more about flower gardens.
d_counseling_signal_20_1,"Commander, if telling the truth would hurt someone's feelings,"
d_counseling_signal_20_2,what's your opinion on white lies?
d_counseling_signal_20_3,I think it's needed in some situations.
d_counseling_signal_20_4,"Lying is a terrible thing, even if it's a white lie."
d_counseling_signal_20_5,!!
d_counseling_signal_20_6,"Do you think that's true, Commander?"
d_counseling_signal_20_7,"I feel the same way. With a white lie, no one gets hurt."
d_counseling_signal_20_8,I guess you're right... a white lie is still a lie...
d_counseling_signal_20_9,But I think sometimes it's better to lie in order to spare the other person's feelings.
d_counseling_signal_20_10,I have a conversation with Signal about lying.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_1,"Imagine there are two people,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_2,but only enough food for one.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_3,What would you do?
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_4,"Rock, paper, scissors."
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_5,Split the food.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_6,Leaving it up to luck... that's not a reasonable solution.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_7,You must choose a game of skill to determine the victor.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_8,"Boxing, for example. That would be a fine choice."
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_9,!!
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_10,An interesting idea. I never considered it.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_11,A respectable answer.
d_counseling_snowwhite_01_12,Snow White and I talk about our favorite foods.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_1,Scarlet is very laid back... perhaps too much so.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_2,It gets on my nerves on occasion.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_3,I'm considering whether to say something to her about it.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_4,Teammates should always be open with each other.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_5,I'm sure her nonchalant attitude must have helped you out in the past.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_6,Hm. I disagree.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_7,Even teammates can keep secrets from each other.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_8,"That is, so long as doing so won't cause harm to the other person."
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_9,... That's true.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_10,We once ended up avoiding a storm because Scarlet moved so slowly.
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_11,I suppose there is a positive and a negative side to everything...
d_counseling_snowwhite_02_12,Snow White and I discuss Scarlet.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_1,Tell me one positive thing about the Ark.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_2,Choose only one thing.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_3,There is unlimited food.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_4,There is a lot to do.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_5,... What?
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_6,Unlimited?
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_7,Don't lie. There's no way something like that exists.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_8,A lot to do? Do you mean nightlife?
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_9,Sorry. Such things do not interest me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_03_10,I introduce more aspects of the Ark to Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_1,You all seem to eat a lot of Splendamin.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_2,What does it taste like? Are the portions big enough?
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_3,Does it make you feel full? Is it easy to preserve?
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_4,"The taste isn't great, but it's perfect in terms of nourishment."
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_5,I'll get you some.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_6,... This makes me even more curious.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_7,"If you can, get some for me at some point."
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_8,I will repay you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_9,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_10,Thank you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_04_11,I explain the different types of Splendamin to Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_1,The human body is weak.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_2,"Yet, the mind is strong."
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_3,How do humans keep their minds sharp?
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_4,Showers.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_5,Sleep.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_6,...?
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_7,Is that true?
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_8,"Then, let me use the showers here."
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_9,Sleep.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_10,... It's a pity. That is something I cannot do.
d_counseling_snowwhite_05_11,I debate the true nature of the mind with Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_1,The enemy must be killed.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_2,No quarter must be given.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_3,Do you agree?
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_4,"I agree. They must all be crushed, no matter what."
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_5,"If communication is possible, I will try talking to them first."
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_6,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_7,"Easy there, tiger."
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_8,I know very well you don't actually believe that.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_9,That's a very 'you' answer.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_10,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_11,That is the source of your strength.
d_counseling_snowwhite_06_12,Snow White trains me in the code of conduct when encountering the enemy.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_1,Rapunzel is quite odd.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_2,"She'll babble on about something nonsensical, then start drooling and panting."
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_3,I don't know how I should react when that happens.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_4,It's best to ignore her.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_5,Drool and pant along with her.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_6,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_7,Scarlet said the same thing.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_8,"Since you both seem to think that's the best course of action, that's what I'll do."
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_9,I tried.
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_10,She just gave me a weird look. I have no idea why...
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_11,"After all, I was just doing the same thing that she was."
d_counseling_snowwhite_07_12,I listen to Snow White tell more stories about Rapunzel.
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_1,Scarlet says crime is frequent in the Ark.
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_2,Is that true?
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_3,Absolutely not.
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_4,"It's sad, but it's true."
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_5,Hm...
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_6,One of you is lying...
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_7,I just don't know who.
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_8,I don't understand.
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_9,What would lead someone to commit a crime in such a utopia?
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_10,"It goes without saying, but there is no crime on the surface. That's because there are no humans."
d_counseling_snowwhite_08_11,Snow White and I discuss criminology.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_1,The Outpost is a good place.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_2,"It's relatively safe, and has a lot of food."
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_3,There is more than enough to live on here. Why do you still dream of reclaiming the surface?
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_4,Because this place won't be safe forever.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_5,It's just a pipe dream.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_6,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_7,That's true.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_8,Nothing stays safe forever.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_9,A pipe dream.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_10,A dream that lacks the power of conviction.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_11,I do not know how far that will carry the humans.
d_counseling_snowwhite_09_12,I tell Snow White about my hopes of one day reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_1,"Your teammates seem like good people, and your bond with them seems so strong."
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_2,Developing such a bond is no easy task.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_3,I am curious. What is your secret?
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_4,Being handsome.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_5,I'm not sure.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_6,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_7,Could you please be serious?
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_8,"I see. So, the bond occurs naturally?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_9,I suppose that must be correct.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_10,Interpersonal connections are not something that can be forced.
d_counseling_snowwhite_10_11,Snow White and I talk about teammates.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_1,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_2,Snow White is checking her gears.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_3,Wait a little longer.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_4,Speak to her.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_5,Snow White conducted a little more maintenance.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_6,How long have you been standing there? You didn't even say anything.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_7,I appreciate you not interrupting me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_8,Wait just a moment. I'll be done soon.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_9,Snow White conducted a little more maintenance.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_10,Thanks for waiting.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_11,I was finally able to finish the maintenance on my gears.
d_counseling_snowwhite_11_12,Snow White and I have a meaningful conversation.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_1,Do you think we'll ever reclaim the surface?
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_2,"I do, because I have faith in you."
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_3,"No, I don't."
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_4,You seem confident.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_5,... Very well then. You can trust me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_6,I'll make it happen.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_7,... I can understand where you're coming from.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_8,But I must reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_9,That is the reason I exist.
d_counseling_snowwhite_12_10,Snow White and I speak more about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_1,"I'm not sure what your approach is with Nikkes,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_2,but watch yourself around any Nikkes from Inherit.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_3,Humans are just tools to them.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_4,I'll keep that in mind.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_5,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_6,Especially Dorothy.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_7,But I'll stop there for now.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_8,I trust that you know how to handle yourself.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_9,I can tell you don't trust me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_10,I was simply giving you a friendly word of caution.
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_11,"If you'd prefer not to heed my advice, I won't force you."
d_counseling_snowwhite_13_12,Snow White and I have a conversation about Inherit.
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_1,Does the surface frighten you?
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_2,Not at all.
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_3,A little bit.
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_4,"I don't know if you have a lot of trust in your Nikkes, or if you're just foolhardy."
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_5,"Regardless, take this to heart."
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_6,"Up on the surface, death is always lurking nearby."
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_7,... I see.
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_8,"And despite that fact, you still came up here?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_14_9,Snow White tells me of all the things to watch out for up on the surface.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_1,Rapunzel once asked me if I've ever wanted
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_2,to go back in time and correct any mistakes I had made.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_3,How would you respond to this question?
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_4,I would go back in an instant.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_5,I wouldn't go back.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_6,So you have regrets as well...
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_7,You and I are the same.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_8,"For me, the past should remain there."
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_9,I lost everything during the Mind Switch.
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_10,"Despite that, I have no regrets, and I refuse to be lost in the past."
d_counseling_snowwhite_15_11,Snow White and have a conversation about past regrets.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_1,"Two roads lie ahead of you. One is a road you've taken before, but it's very long."
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_2,"The other is much shorter, but unfamiliar to you."
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_3,"If it was you, what road would you choose?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_4,The road I'm familiar with.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_5,The new road.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_6,You are choosing safety.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_7,I think that is the right choice for a human being.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_8,"As for me, I would take the other road."
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_9,... Unexpected.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_10,I didn't imagine a human was capable of casting themselves into the unknown without a safety net.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_11,I'm very much the same.
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_12,"If it means I can achieve my goals more quickly, I can face any hardship."
d_counseling_snowwhite_16_13,"As I spoke with Snow White, the surface was on both of our minds."
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_1,"Excluding all essential combat and survival gear,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_2,is there anything else you always take up to the surface?
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_3,Small snack-sized bits of Splendamin.
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_4,An Ark Ranger figurine.
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_5,!!
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_6,Very interesting.
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_7,Would you mind letting me try some?
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_8,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_9,And... what exactly is that?
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_10,Is it something you eat?
d_counseling_snowwhite_17_11,I hand over a snack to Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_1,Scarlet keeps trying to offer me alcohol.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_2,She says she feels lonely drinking alone.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_3,But I don't want to drink. When I'm drunk I tend to be less aware of my surroundings.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_4,Sometimes you just need to loosen up.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_5,"Since she's lonely, you should keep her company. You can drink water."
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_6,Loosen up? In this death trap we call the surface?
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_7,That's practically the same as committing suicide.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_8,I will do nothing of the sort.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_9,!!
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_10,"Oh, so that's how it is. Even if I don't drink with her, I can still be by her side."
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_11,That was good advice. Thank you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_18_12,I have a conversation with Snow White about the surface and alcohol.
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_1,"Whenever I'm on the surface, I lose all sense of time."
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_2,"For me, the past, present, and future are virtually indistinguishable."
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_3,But...
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_4,"I'm curious,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_5,have you ever given the future much thought?
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_6,We'll make a new Outpost on the surface that we can live in.
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_7,We'll be fighting tooth and nail just like we are now.
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_8,You are optimistic.
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_9,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_10,"But if that does come to pass, it would be wonderful."
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_11,A future is indistinguishable from the present...
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_12,"Yes, you are most likely correct."
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_13,I will continue fighting until the surface is once again under mankind's control.
d_counseling_snowwhite_19_14,Snow White seems deep in thought.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_1,"If you had to choose between thunder, snow, rain or a heatwave,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_2,which would you prefer?
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_3,Um... Snow?
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_4,They all sound terrible.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_5,Snow?
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_6,I remember when you were stranded and buried under the snow.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_7,"Perhaps you enjoy living life on the edge, on the brink of death?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_8,Fine.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_9,These are all dangerous weather conditions for humans.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_10,My apologies. I did not consider this.
d_counseling_snowwhite_20_11,Snow White and I talk about the weather.
d_counseling_soline_01_1,Commander! I heard something interesting.
d_counseling_soline_01_2,"Someone said that if you eat something bitter,"
d_counseling_soline_01_3,"mugwort-flavored or garlic-flavored Splendamin, then you'll become an adult. Is that true?"
d_counseling_soline_01_4,"Actually, it'll turn you into a human."
d_counseling_soline_01_5,It's true.
d_counseling_soline_01_6,A Nikke can become human again?
d_counseling_soline_01_7,There's no way that Splendamin has that kind of effect.
d_counseling_soline_01_8,"Commander, do not fall for ridiculous rumors, okay?"
d_counseling_soline_01_9,Just as I thought! The rumors are true!
d_counseling_soline_01_10,Hehe! I'm going to buy a bunch and eat them all!
d_counseling_soline_01_11,I talk with Soline about becoming an adult.
d_counseling_soline_02_1,"You know, at the Outpost..."
d_counseling_soline_02_2,there's a... toy store.
d_counseling_soline_02_3,N-not that I'm really interested!
d_counseling_soline_02_4,But... have you been there before?
d_counseling_soline_02_5,I have.
d_counseling_soline_02_6,I haven't.
d_counseling_soline_02_7,Y-you have? When?!
d_counseling_soline_02_8,You should have taken me with you! You're so mean!
d_counseling_soline_02_9,Yeah? Th-then... Do you want to go with me?
d_counseling_soline_02_10,"I'm not interested! But, I just thought that you might want to go there."
d_counseling_soline_02_11,"So, will you go with me?"
d_counseling_soline_02_12,Soline and I plan a visit to the toy store.
d_counseling_soline_03_1,Brid is so mean to me these days.
d_counseling_soline_03_2,"Every time I say something, she just sighs..."
d_counseling_soline_03_3,"And then she tells me to go away, because I'm noisy."
d_counseling_soline_03_4,Do you think she is too mean to me?
d_counseling_soline_03_5,Yes.
d_counseling_soline_03_6,No.
d_counseling_soline_03_7,Right?
d_counseling_soline_03_8,I'm so relieved that you think the same way as me.
d_counseling_soline_03_9,"Just like I thought, I wasn't the one acting childish!"
d_counseling_soline_03_10,N-no?
d_counseling_soline_03_11,"Then you're a big meanie, too!"
d_counseling_soline_03_12,"I soothe Soline, who is offended."
d_counseling_soline_04_1,I'm so tired of Diesel only giving me strawberry candy all the time.
d_counseling_soline_04_2,I don't even like candy that much.
d_counseling_soline_04_3,I've suffered through it because it's from Diesel... And I can't stand it anymore!
d_counseling_soline_04_4,But... I think she will be upset if I ask for a different flavor.
d_counseling_soline_04_5,What should I do?
d_counseling_soline_04_6,Buy Diesel a new flavor of candy.
d_counseling_soline_04_7,Lie down in front of Diesel and throw a tantrum because you want a different flavor.
d_counseling_soline_04_8,Buy her new candy?
d_counseling_soline_04_9,Hmm... That's a good idea.
d_counseling_soline_04_10,I can give Diesel a present
d_counseling_soline_04_11,and be freed from the tyranny of strawberry at the same time!
d_counseling_soline_04_12,Perfect! I'll get right on it!
d_counseling_soline_04_13,I'm not a kid!
d_counseling_soline_04_14,I don't throw tantrums!
d_counseling_soline_04_15,I talk with Soline about strawberry candy.
d_counseling_soline_05_1,"Commander, tell me."
d_counseling_soline_05_2,"Imagine two people. One is cute, and the other is mature."
d_counseling_soline_05_3,Which one would you date?
d_counseling_soline_05_4,The cute one.
d_counseling_soline_05_5,The mature one.
d_counseling_soline_05_6,... Really?
d_counseling_soline_05_7,That's not what I expected.
d_counseling_soline_05_8,Why can't you just like the mature one?
d_counseling_soline_05_9,"After all, I'm not cute at all..."
d_counseling_soline_05_10,Really? You'd like the mature one?
d_counseling_soline_05_11,Hehe.
d_counseling_soline_05_12,Just as I thought.
d_counseling_soline_05_13,Just you wait! I'll become mature in no time!
d_counseling_soline_05_14,I listen to Soline's lecture on becoming mature.
d_counseling_soline_06_1,"These days, when Diesel and Brid see me,"
d_counseling_soline_06_2,they keep patting my head and saying I'm cute.
d_counseling_soline_06_3,I think it's because they've never seen me at my best.
d_counseling_soline_06_4,They don't know how competent and charismatic I am!
d_counseling_soline_06_5,What do I have to do for them to stop seeing me as cute?
d_counseling_soline_06_6,"Say ""stop seeing me as cute"" with your charisma."
d_counseling_soline_06_7,Chug a cup of bitter coffee in front of them.
d_counseling_soline_06_8,How do I talk with charisma?
d_counseling_soline_06_9,"Also, I already tried that before."
d_counseling_soline_06_10,"But it doesn't get through. Instead, they pat my head even more."
d_counseling_soline_06_11,Chug a bitter cup of coffee?
d_counseling_soline_06_12,"Hmm... I guess if they see me drinking bitter coffee without flinching, then their impressions will be changed."
d_counseling_soline_06_13,"Okay, might as well give it a try! Since I'm an adult and all!"
d_counseling_soline_06_14,That's good advice. Thanks!
d_counseling_soline_06_15,I discuss how to not look cute with Soline.
d_counseling_soline_07_1,"A couple days ago, I went to the park."
d_counseling_soline_07_2,Cafe Sweety saw me and asked if I was a lost child!
d_counseling_soline_07_3,Then they called those kid cops A.C.P.U. and Diesel to take me home!
d_counseling_soline_07_4,"I told them I was a Nikke, but they completely ignored me."
d_counseling_soline_07_5,I'm so angry. How should I take revenge on them?
d_counseling_soline_07_6,"Next time you see them, report that some scary big sisters are bothering you."
d_counseling_soline_07_7,"Next time you see them, report them as missing children as well."
d_counseling_soline_07_8,Scary big sisters?
d_counseling_soline_07_9,No! I won't call them big sisters!
d_counseling_soline_07_10,"Anyway, no matter how bad they might be, I'll never report them."
d_counseling_soline_07_11,I need another solution.
d_counseling_soline_07_12,"You mean, and an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?"
d_counseling_soline_07_13,"Hmm, I like it!"
d_counseling_soline_07_14,"I'm going to report them, too!"
d_counseling_soline_07_15,Then they will know how embarrassing it is!
d_counseling_soline_07_16,I explore ways to take revenge on Cafe Sweety with Soline.
d_counseling_soline_08_1,So annoying. So annoying!
d_counseling_soline_08_2,"Today I was working at the station, minding my own business..."
d_counseling_soline_08_3,"Then someone came up to me and said, ""Isn't it illegal for children to be working?"" But, I'm an adult!"
d_counseling_soline_08_4,Argh. I'm so angry! It's so annoying!
d_counseling_soline_08_5,That person just hasn't seen your competence yet.
d_counseling_soline_08_6,Do you want to take revenge on that person?
d_counseling_soline_08_7,"That must be it, right?"
d_counseling_soline_08_8,Just wait. One day I will show everyone my competence!
d_counseling_soline_08_9,They'll say that there is no attendant like Soline!
d_counseling_soline_08_10,!!
d_counseling_soline_08_11,What do you mean revenge? Take revenge on a passenger?
d_counseling_soline_08_12,"I'm just saying I'm annoyed, that's all! You're so dumb!"
d_counseling_soline_08_13,"I soothe Soline, who is enraged."
d_counseling_soline_09_1,Commander.
d_counseling_soline_09_2,...
d_counseling_soline_09_3,N-never mind.
d_counseling_soline_09_4,Are you bored or something?
d_counseling_soline_09_5,Do you want some candy?
d_counseling_soline_09_6,N-no!
d_counseling_soline_09_7,You think I poke you every time I'm bored?
d_counseling_soline_09_8,I was just... curious if you wanted to eat something.
d_counseling_soline_09_9,!!
d_counseling_soline_09_10,How did you know?
d_counseling_soline_09_11,Can you read minds or something?
d_counseling_soline_09_12,That's so fascinating!
d_counseling_soline_09_13,I have a joyful counseling time after putting some candy in Soline's mouth.
d_counseling_soline_10_1,I saw that Nikke Rumani on TV.
d_counseling_soline_10_2,She said you need to exercise with weights to have an adult body.
d_counseling_soline_10_3,"So, I'm going to start lifting weights today!"
d_counseling_soline_10_4,Then I'll grow taller and look more like an adult!
d_counseling_soline_10_5,Do you really believe that you will grow taller?
d_counseling_soline_10_6,Good luck.
d_counseling_soline_10_7,Yes! Of course!
d_counseling_soline_10_8,"Hmm, you don't seem to agree."
d_counseling_soline_10_9,Hmph!
d_counseling_soline_10_10,"Well, whether or not you support me..."
d_counseling_soline_10_11,I'm still going to do my best!
d_counseling_soline_10_12,I make exercise plans with Soline in hopes of helping her grow.
d_counseling_soline_11_1,"I'm not sure why, but I've been craving some good food for a while now."
d_counseling_soline_11_2,Preferably something sweet.
d_counseling_soline_11_3,You're just going through a growth spurt.
d_counseling_soline_11_4,Be careful or else you'll be putting on the pounds.
d_counseling_soline_11_5,A growth spurt?
d_counseling_soline_11_6,No wonder my body feels different than it did a few days ago.
d_counseling_soline_11_7,So that's what it was!
d_counseling_soline_11_8,What? That can't be it!
d_counseling_soline_11_9,"My weight hasn't changed! Gosh, you're so annoying!"
d_counseling_soline_11_10,Soline and I talk about the different foods that we have a craving for.
d_counseling_soline_12_1,"If we reclaim the surface, do you think we could go on a trip?"
d_counseling_soline_12_2,Traveling on a train... something like that.
d_counseling_soline_12_3,Sure we can. Let's start planning our itinerary.
d_counseling_soline_12_4,It may be a little soon to be thinking of that...
d_counseling_soline_12_5,The first thing I want to do is ride the AZX through the snowy terrain!
d_counseling_soline_12_6,"And I want to make a snowman as well! What about you, Commander?"
d_counseling_soline_12_7,You could have at least humored me for a minute...
d_counseling_soline_12_8,...
d_counseling_soline_12_9,I hope it's not too far down the line.
d_counseling_soline_12_10,I have a conversation with Soline about the future.
d_counseling_soline_13_1,I wanted to buy Brid a coffee so I went to the Cafe and asked for an americano.
d_counseling_soline_13_2,But the employee there said a kid shouldn't be drinking coffee!!
d_counseling_soline_13_3,How rude!
d_counseling_soline_13_4,We'll go to a different café next time.
d_counseling_soline_13_5,Let's have Brid and Diesel come with us.
d_counseling_soline_13_6,"For sure, I'm never going there again!"
d_counseling_soline_13_7,There are plenty of other cafes around here.
d_counseling_soline_13_8,I feel a lot better after talking to you!
d_counseling_soline_13_9,What would that change?
d_counseling_soline_13_10,"If anything, it'd just make us all look even younger."
d_counseling_soline_13_11,I help Soline look for other cafes.
d_counseling_soline_14_1,"Commander, do you like tall girls?"
d_counseling_soline_14_2,Or do you prefer someone smaller... like me?
d_counseling_soline_14_3,"Personally, I prefer shorter women."
d_counseling_soline_14_4,I'd prefer if they were about my height.
d_counseling_soline_14_5,Do you really?
d_counseling_soline_14_6,Then I don't have to try so hard to grow taller.
d_counseling_soline_14_7,In that case...
d_counseling_soline_14_8,how many more centimeters do I have to grow...?
d_counseling_soline_14_9,I'm gonna start drinking more milk.
d_counseling_soline_14_10,I have a conversation with Soline about height.
d_counseling_soline_15_1,I think I need to change my image.
d_counseling_soline_15_2,First up is how I dress. What kind of clothing should I wear?
d_counseling_soline_15_3,Something that's all business.
d_counseling_soline_15_4,Something more casual.
d_counseling_soline_15_5,I like the sound of that!
d_counseling_soline_15_6,That would probably make me look more mature.
d_counseling_soline_15_7,Not that I'm not already mature!
d_counseling_soline_15_8,Hmm... I don't think that's much different from how I dress now.
d_counseling_soline_15_9,What other styles could I try?
d_counseling_soline_15_10,I look for suitable styles with Soline.
d_counseling_soline_16_1,I heard that married couples on the surface used to go on trips together.
d_counseling_soline_16_2,"A... honeymoon, was it? Have you heard about this before?"
d_counseling_soline_16_3,I came back from one before.
d_counseling_soline_16_4,It'd be nice for you and I to go on a honeymoon.
d_counseling_soline_16_5,Hmm?
d_counseling_soline_16_6,What do you mean?
d_counseling_soline_16_7,Wait... were you married before?!
d_counseling_soline_16_8,Huh...?
d_counseling_soline_16_9,Wh-what? Are you confessing your feelings for me? This is all so sudden...
d_counseling_soline_16_10,"You're just pulling my leg, aren't you? Argh, you're the worst!"
d_counseling_soline_16_11,I dodged a beating from Soline the entire time we were talking.
d_counseling_soline_17_1,Diesel and Brid are my best friends. I feel so carefree around them.
d_counseling_soline_17_2,Do you think they feel the same way about me?
d_counseling_soline_17_3,I'm sure they do.
d_counseling_soline_17_4,Why don't you ask them?
d_counseling_soline_17_5,"Yeah, exactly! I'm sure the feeling is mutual!"
d_counseling_soline_17_6,It feels nice knowing that.
d_counseling_soline_17_7,No way! That'd be so awkward!
d_counseling_soline_17_8,Not a word of this to anyone!
d_counseling_soline_17_9,I listen to Soline as she spoke highly of Diesel and Brid.
d_counseling_soline_18_1,"I was about to brush my teeth yesterday, when I noticed something..."
d_counseling_soline_18_2,Diesel swapped the regular toothpaste for strawberry-flavored! Can you believe that?
d_counseling_soline_18_3,"Strawberry candy is one thing, but strawberry toothpaste? No thanks."
d_counseling_soline_18_4,It probably tastes nice and sweet.
d_counseling_soline_18_5,Let's change it to another toothpaste.
d_counseling_soline_18_6,Well... it did end up tasting really nice actually...
d_counseling_soline_18_7,It was like brushing your teeth with candy.
d_counseling_soline_18_8,I can't complain.
d_counseling_soline_18_9,Hmmm. We don't have to go that far.
d_counseling_soline_18_10,And the taste actually wasn't half bad after all.
d_counseling_soline_18_11,I listen to Soline tell me more about the strawberry toothpaste incident.
d_counseling_soline_19_1,"Commander, have you ever been in love?"
d_counseling_soline_19_2,"I was watching TV today, and there was a show about people trying to find love."
d_counseling_soline_19_3,So it made me curious.
d_counseling_soline_19_4,"Of course, she's standing right in front of me."
d_counseling_soline_19_5,Do you want to hear my love story?
d_counseling_soline_19_6,Hm? In front of Commander?
d_counseling_soline_19_7,W-wait for a second... me?! You're in love with me?
d_counseling_soline_19_8,You better not be kidding around this time!
d_counseling_soline_19_9,NO!!
d_counseling_soline_19_10,I don't want to hear it. Don't say it. I don't need to hear this.
d_counseling_soline_19_11,I shouldn't have said anything...
d_counseling_soline_19_12,Soline and I have a conversation about love.
d_counseling_soline_20_1,It's such a pain cleaning the AZX. This isn't a one-woman job!
d_counseling_soline_20_2,I'd like to see Brid and Diesel try and do this on their own. Then they'd see how hard it is.
d_counseling_soline_20_3,Let's go on strike.
d_counseling_soline_20_4,I'll help you with the cleaning.
d_counseling_soline_20_5,I don't think that would change anything.
d_counseling_soline_20_6,Not to mention that Diesel that Brid are even busier than I am.
d_counseling_soline_20_7,Really? You better not change your mind!
d_counseling_soline_20_8,I was planning on getting back to it in a moment.
d_counseling_soline_20_9,"Good thing I brought this up with you, Commander!"
d_counseling_soline_20_10,I cleaned the AZX with Soline.
d_counseling_sugar_01_1,Partner!
d_counseling_sugar_01_2,I've been getting a lot of complaints at the office about my bike being too loud.
d_counseling_sugar_01_3,What do you think I should do?
d_counseling_sugar_01_4,Give a heartfelt apology.
d_counseling_sugar_01_5,Give them a swift kick in the rear.
d_counseling_sugar_01_6,... Hm.
d_counseling_sugar_01_7,I'll think about it.
d_counseling_sugar_01_8,Nice!
d_counseling_sugar_01_9,I was thinking the exact same thing.
d_counseling_sugar_01_10,Good answer.
d_counseling_sugar_01_11,Sugar and I spend time talking about her bike.
d_counseling_sugar_02_1,Milk says she would rather gargle bleach than drink coffee with sugar.
d_counseling_sugar_02_2,What can you even say to such a flagrant insult?
d_counseling_sugar_02_3,Give her some bleach.
d_counseling_sugar_02_4,Keep things cordial with your squadmates.
d_counseling_sugar_02_5,Genius!
d_counseling_sugar_02_6,"I knew you'd have my back, Partner."
d_counseling_sugar_02_7,I'll stop by Yan's store on the way.
d_counseling_sugar_02_8,You want me to just... ignore her?
d_counseling_sugar_02_9,"Well, I guess that could be a solution."
d_counseling_sugar_02_10,Sugar and I have a relaxing tea time together.
d_counseling_sugar_03_1,"I've told you how Black Typhoon is a real gas-guzzler, right?"
d_counseling_sugar_03_2,Any ideas?
d_counseling_sugar_03_3,Do you feel that the fuel you put into Black Typhoon is a waste?
d_counseling_sugar_03_4,Change to cheaper fuel.
d_counseling_sugar_03_5,!!
d_counseling_sugar_03_6,Nah. Not at all.
d_counseling_sugar_03_7,... Thanks.
d_counseling_sugar_03_8,I'm not gonna shorten her life span.
d_counseling_sugar_03_9,"But thanks for trying, Partner."
d_counseling_sugar_03_10,I listen to Sugar brag about Black Typhoon for a long time.
d_counseling_sugar_04_1,I am working on a new sugar coffee recipe.
d_counseling_sugar_04_2,How many scoops of sugar do you think is best?
d_counseling_sugar_04_3,10 spoonfuls.
d_counseling_sugar_04_4,11 spoonfuls.
d_counseling_sugar_04_5,"Nah, not enough."
d_counseling_sugar_04_6,You wouldn't even be able to taste the sweetness.
d_counseling_sugar_04_7,"Yeah, that should just about do it."
d_counseling_sugar_04_8,Just enough to start tasting the sweetness.
d_counseling_sugar_04_9,Sugar and I talk about coffee.
d_counseling_sugar_05_1,You know Milk and Frima?
d_counseling_sugar_05_2,They're a real pain in my neck. All they do is stand around.
d_counseling_sugar_05_3,"Why don't you just stand around, then? Someone else will do the work eventually."
d_counseling_sugar_05_4,Give them a kick in the pants.
d_counseling_sugar_05_5,"Hey, not bad, Partner."
d_counseling_sugar_05_6,I'll beat them at their own game!
d_counseling_sugar_05_7,"I already tried that, but it didn't do any good."
d_counseling_sugar_05_8,Maybe I should try running them over with Black Typhoon...
d_counseling_sugar_05_9,Sugar and I have a discussion about the proper way to slack off.
d_counseling_sugar_06_1,Sometimes Milk and Frima like to talk about music.
d_counseling_sugar_06_2,What kind of music do you think suits my vibe?
d_counseling_sugar_06_3,Hard-hitting heavy metal.
d_counseling_sugar_06_4,Graceful classical music.
d_counseling_sugar_06_5,Huh. You think so?
d_counseling_sugar_06_6,"I guess that's the easy answer considering how I look, but I'm a little disappointed to hear you say that..."
d_counseling_sugar_06_7,Whoa! Are you some kind of mind reader?
d_counseling_sugar_06_8,"Musical taste has nothing to do with one's physical appearance, but a lot of people don't seem to know that."
d_counseling_sugar_06_9,I discuss music with Sugar.
d_counseling_sugar_07_1,I run into all sorts of shady characters when I'm on the job.
d_counseling_sugar_07_2,"But I've got to maintain my reputation as a problem-solver, so I can't turn anybody down. What should I do?"
d_counseling_sugar_07_3,Image is important. Learn to be patient.
d_counseling_sugar_07_4,"Keep taking every job, no matter how shady."
d_counseling_sugar_07_5,Patience... that's the one thing I'll never be good at.
d_counseling_sugar_07_6,"Thanks anyway, though."
d_counseling_sugar_07_7,"It's like they say, ""you've gotta walk a mile in someone else's shoes""."
d_counseling_sugar_07_8,All right. Next time I'll go ahead and take the jobs regardless.
d_counseling_sugar_07_9,Sugar and I share our work-related grievances.
d_counseling_sugar_08_1,"Vroom, vroom."
d_counseling_sugar_08_2,"Vroom! Vroom, vroom!"
d_counseling_sugar_08_3,Vroooooom!!
d_counseling_sugar_08_4,"Honk, honk!"
d_counseling_sugar_08_5,!!
d_counseling_sugar_08_6,"Vroom, vroom! Vroooooom!!"
d_counseling_sugar_08_7,...
d_counseling_sugar_08_8,Black Typhoon doesn't have a horn.
d_counseling_sugar_08_9,Sugar and I spend time pretending to be motorcycles.
d_counseling_sugar_09_1,"Once in a while, I go a bit overboard when I get caught up in the heat of battle."
d_counseling_sugar_09_2,I'm a little worried that one day I might get myself into trouble.
d_counseling_sugar_09_3,You just do you. I'll heal you whenever you need it.
d_counseling_sugar_09_4,"Cut loose if you want, just be sure to trust me and your other teammates."
d_counseling_sugar_09_5,Even if I might sustain some serious injuries?
d_counseling_sugar_09_6,I don't want to get myself hurt.
d_counseling_sugar_09_7,... Right.
d_counseling_sugar_09_8,I am not fighting alone. Thanks for reminding me.
d_counseling_sugar_09_9,Sugar and I discuss what it's like on the battlefield.
d_counseling_sugar_10_1,"Whenever I go for a ride inside the Ark, there're too many people. It's hard to pick up any speed."
d_counseling_sugar_10_2,I want to redline it! How can I do that?
d_counseling_sugar_10_3,How about adding another 0 to the speedometer?
d_counseling_sugar_10_4,Honk the horn.
d_counseling_sugar_10_5,"So even if I'm only going 30, it'll show up as 300."
d_counseling_sugar_10_6,That could really help lift my spirits. I'll try it out next time.
d_counseling_sugar_10_7,You want me to scare people?
d_counseling_sugar_10_8,"I may be a speed demon, but I'm not rude."
d_counseling_sugar_10_9,Sugar and I have an honest discussion about speed.
d_counseling_sugar_11_1,Black Typhoon has been making some strange noises lately.
d_counseling_sugar_11_2,I wonder what's wrong...
d_counseling_sugar_11_3,Let's inspect the engine.
d_counseling_sugar_11_4,Let's take it to the hospital.
d_counseling_sugar_11_5,Good idea.
d_counseling_sugar_11_6,We can check if there are any other issues while we're at it.
d_counseling_sugar_11_7,The hospital?
d_counseling_sugar_11_8,Somehow I don't think that's the right place to bring it...
d_counseling_sugar_11_9,Sugar and I fret over what to do about Black Typhoon.
d_counseling_sugar_12_1,"Every time I go up to the surface,"
d_counseling_sugar_12_2,I feel this irresistible urge to go for a spin on my bike.
d_counseling_sugar_12_3,Let's do it.
d_counseling_sugar_12_4,Let's do it when we reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_sugar_12_5,Huh?
d_counseling_sugar_12_6,"If we did that now, the Raptures would hear us and be on our tails in an instant."
d_counseling_sugar_12_7,I don't want to throw my life away just because I've got a need for speed.
d_counseling_sugar_12_8,Fine...
d_counseling_sugar_12_9,I can't wait for that day to come.
d_counseling_sugar_12_10,"When that time comes, you'll be there with me, right Partner?"
d_counseling_sugar_12_11,Sugar and I fantasize about burning rubber up on the surface.
d_counseling_sugar_13_1,I had a horrible nightmare.
d_counseling_sugar_13_2,Someone had put milk and cream into a Sugar Coffee.
d_counseling_sugar_13_3,It certainly sounds horrible.
d_counseling_sugar_13_4,That actually sounds kind of good to me.
d_counseling_sugar_13_5,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_sugar_13_6,Sullying a perfectly good sugar coffee with those filthy ingredients.
d_counseling_sugar_13_7,Gives me chills just thinking about it.
d_counseling_sugar_13_8,What?
d_counseling_sugar_13_9,Everybody knows you only put sugar in a Sugar Coffee.
d_counseling_sugar_13_10,"Don't joke around like that, this is no laughing matter!"
d_counseling_sugar_13_11,I have a conversation with Sugar about nightmares.
d_counseling_sugar_14_1,"Hey, what do you think about Frima?"
d_counseling_sugar_14_2,Do you think she has what it takes to be a leader?
d_counseling_sugar_14_3,She's the de facto leader of Cafe Sweety.
d_counseling_sugar_14_4,I think she's a bit too apathetic for that.
d_counseling_sugar_14_5,You know a lot about Frima.
d_counseling_sugar_14_6,You don't understand Frima at all.
d_counseling_sugar_14_7,"It may seem like she's always dragging her feet,"
d_counseling_sugar_14_8,"but in reality, she's incredibly thorough. That way, she can prevent any irritating complications from cropping up."
d_counseling_sugar_14_9,Cafe Sweety would be nothing without her.
d_counseling_sugar_14_10,I have a conversation with Sugar about Frima.
d_counseling_sugar_15_1,"Milk was telling me how fun Would You Rather is, and was asking me all sorts of hypotheticals."
d_counseling_sugar_15_2,I didn't think it was very fun. All the options were too easy!
d_counseling_sugar_15_3,Try and ask me a few questions.
d_counseling_sugar_15_4,"Would you rather only have Sugar Coffee, or Black Typhoon?"
d_counseling_sugar_15_5,"Would you rather only have Sugar Coffee, or me?"
d_counseling_sugar_15_6,...!!!
d_counseling_sugar_15_7,...
d_counseling_sugar_15_8,... I can't choose. I lose.
d_counseling_sugar_15_9,"Again, too easy."
d_counseling_sugar_15_10,"Of course, it's you, Partner."
d_counseling_sugar_15_11,What could be more important than you?
d_counseling_sugar_15_12,...
d_counseling_sugar_15_13,Is this the part where we kiss?
d_counseling_sugar_15_14,Sugar and I play a bit more of Would You Rather.
d_counseling_sugar_16_1,"Partner, do you have a habit that you can't tell anyone about?"
d_counseling_sugar_16_2,When I'm alone I mimic how Black Typhoon sounds.
d_counseling_sugar_16_3,*Vroom-m-m*
d_counseling_sugar_16_4,No.
d_counseling_sugar_16_5,When I'm alone I mimic Frima's voice.
d_counseling_sugar_16_6,... Are you sure?
d_counseling_sugar_16_7,"You're not just saying that because you're embarrassed, are you?"
d_counseling_sugar_16_8,Be honest!
d_counseling_sugar_16_9,I guess there is a certain appeal
d_counseling_sugar_16_10,in trimming off all the fat when you're speaking.
d_counseling_sugar_16_11,Maybe I'll try it out sometime.
d_counseling_sugar_16_12,Sugar and I take turns imitating various sounds.
d_counseling_sugar_17_1,I brought some coffee on my way here.
d_counseling_sugar_17_2,Which one would you like?
d_counseling_sugar_17_3,They're both Sugar Coffees... just give me whichever.
d_counseling_sugar_17_4,Which one is the Sugar Coffee?
d_counseling_sugar_17_5,Nicely done!
d_counseling_sugar_17_6,"It wasn't really a test, but I'm glad to see that you could tell."
d_counseling_sugar_17_7,"Here, have a drink."
d_counseling_sugar_17_8,Actually...
d_counseling_sugar_17_9,Both of them are Sugar Coffees.
d_counseling_sugar_17_10,I thought you'd be able to tell.
d_counseling_sugar_17_11,Was it really that hard?
d_counseling_sugar_17_12,Sugar and I sipped coffee as we had our discussion.
d_counseling_sugar_18_1,"You wear a helmet whenever you ride a motorcycle, don't you?"
d_counseling_sugar_18_2,Of course.
d_counseling_sugar_18_3,"You don't wear one though, isn't that right?"
d_counseling_sugar_18_4,Good.
d_counseling_sugar_18_5,"It's okay for me not to since I'm a Nikke, but it's a must for you."
d_counseling_sugar_18_6,I'm a Nikke.
d_counseling_sugar_18_7,This noggin of mine is tougher than any helmet.
d_counseling_sugar_18_8,"But you're a human being. No matter how skilled a rider you are, you could always get into an accident."
d_counseling_sugar_18_9,"Enjoying a nice ride is one thing, but safety comes first."
d_counseling_sugar_18_10,Sugar and I talk about how to ride motorcycles safely.
d_counseling_sugar_19_1,How come there aren't any motorcycle races around here?
d_counseling_sugar_19_2,"I'd crush it, I just know it."
d_counseling_sugar_19_3,You should start one of your own.
d_counseling_sugar_19_4,It isn't popular enough.
d_counseling_sugar_19_5,I could name it whatever I want...
d_counseling_sugar_19_6,This is so exciting!
d_counseling_sugar_19_7,But how do I get started?
d_counseling_sugar_19_8,I guess you're right...
d_counseling_sugar_19_9,"If it were more popular, they would have already set up a racing circuit."
d_counseling_sugar_19_10,What can I do to make more people aware of motorcycle racing?
d_counseling_sugar_19_11,Sugar and I fantasize about a motorcycle racing competition.
d_counseling_sugar_20_1,We hit record numbers this month with Sugar Coffee sales.
d_counseling_sugar_20_2,Do you know the reason?
d_counseling_sugar_20_3,That's because the population in the Outpost has increased.
d_counseling_sugar_20_4,That's because the taste of the Sugar Coffee has improved.
d_counseling_sugar_20_5,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_sugar_20_6,More Nikkes are living here than ever before.
d_counseling_sugar_20_7,"That's a load off my mind. Thanks, Partner."
d_counseling_sugar_20_8,Sugar Coffee's claim to fame is its perfect blend of various flavors.
d_counseling_sugar_20_9,The flavor hasn't changed at all...
d_counseling_sugar_20_10,Sugar and I have a debate about coffee sales.
d_counseling_yuni_01_1,"Commander, Mihara hasn't been spending as much time with me lately..."
d_counseling_yuni_01_2,Is she sick of me or something?
d_counseling_yuni_01_3,Try throwing a hissy fit.
d_counseling_yuni_01_4,Use physical force to keep her with you.
d_counseling_yuni_01_5,"I tried that already, but it didn't work..."
d_counseling_yuni_01_6,*Sigh* Whatever should I do...
d_counseling_yuni_01_7,...
d_counseling_yuni_01_8,"Yes, that's it! It's time to get physical."
d_counseling_yuni_01_9,I'll give Mihara a few good whacks.
d_counseling_yuni_01_10,I have a conversation with Yuni about Mihara.
d_counseling_yuni_02_1,I'm in a real pickle.
d_counseling_yuni_02_2,"I want to buy some handcuffs and a whip,"
d_counseling_yuni_02_3,but I don't have enough money to get both!
d_counseling_yuni_02_4,Tie Mihara up with the whip.
d_counseling_yuni_02_5,I'll buy them for you.
d_counseling_yuni_02_6,Ah-ha!
d_counseling_yuni_02_7,Of course! How could I forget such a basic maneuver?
d_counseling_yuni_02_8,"Thanks for the advice, Commander."
d_counseling_yuni_02_9,"I appreciate the offer, Commander..."
d_counseling_yuni_02_10,"But if you did that, then they wouldn't truly belong to me."
d_counseling_yuni_02_11,Yuni lectures me about the uses of various instruments.
d_counseling_yuni_03_1,"Capturing Raptures is my job, but I'm no good at it."
d_counseling_yuni_03_2,"Commander, do you know what happens to a Rapture once it's captured?"
d_counseling_yuni_03_3,They're studied and then returned to their home.
d_counseling_yuni_03_4,... They probably get disposed of.
d_counseling_yuni_03_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_yuni_03_6,"I'm not a child, you know.
You don't have to lie."
d_counseling_yuni_03_7,"Nevertheless, thank you for being so considerate."
d_counseling_yuni_03_8,... That's what I thought.
d_counseling_yuni_03_9,Everyone else lies to me when I ask them that question.
d_counseling_yuni_03_10,"But not you, Commander. You're a good person."
d_counseling_yuni_03_11,I have a light-hearted conversation with Yuni about the Raptures.
d_counseling_yuni_04_1,"I want to use this whip to attack the Raptures,"
d_counseling_yuni_04_2,but Mihara always stops me.
d_counseling_yuni_04_3,Why? I'm much better with a whip than a gun.
d_counseling_yuni_04_4,Because Raptures don't feel any pain.
d_counseling_yuni_04_5,Because the whip hurts more than the gun.
d_counseling_yuni_04_6,Ah...
d_counseling_yuni_04_7,"That's why... I guess even if I did use it, they wouldn't be able to appreciate it."
d_counseling_yuni_04_8,"You're so smart, Commander!"
d_counseling_yuni_04_9,"No, Commander. That's not it."
d_counseling_yuni_04_10,It's not a matter of which hurts more. It's something else entirely.
d_counseling_yuni_04_11,Yuni teaches me how to use the whip.
d_counseling_yuni_05_1,"Mihara says that when I'm sleeping, I try to grab anything I can get my hands on."
d_counseling_yuni_05_2,"Not that long ago, I broke something of Mihara's that she cherished."
d_counseling_yuni_05_3,Is there anything I can do to change my sleeping habits?
d_counseling_yuni_05_4,What about tying up your hands before you go to sleep?
d_counseling_yuni_05_5,Find something to hold onto before you go to sleep.
d_counseling_yuni_05_6,Hmm... I'm not really into that.
d_counseling_yuni_05_7,It sounds uncomfortable.
d_counseling_yuni_05_8,That's genius!
d_counseling_yuni_05_9,"From now on, I'll find something that I can hold onto before I go to sleep."
d_counseling_yuni_05_10,I have a conversation with Yuni about sleeping habits.
d_counseling_yuni_06_1,"One day, if all the Raptures are gone,"
d_counseling_yuni_06_2,and the world is peaceful once again...
d_counseling_yuni_06_3,what should I do? I certainly won't be able to capture Raptures anymore.
d_counseling_yuni_06_4,Just live out your days in peace.
d_counseling_yuni_06_5,How about running a club with Mihara?
d_counseling_yuni_06_6,Ha ha! Okay.
d_counseling_yuni_06_7,That sounds nice.
d_counseling_yuni_06_8,"After all, we'd be living in a world where nothing in particular needs to be done, right?"
d_counseling_yuni_06_9,"That's a good idea, but..."
d_counseling_yuni_06_10,"If the world changes, then I want to change along with it."
d_counseling_yuni_06_11,I have a conversation with Yuni about the distant future.
d_counseling_yuni_07_1,Mihara really tore into me just now.
d_counseling_yuni_07_2,I tied up the cookie bag so tightly that the cookies inside got crushed.
d_counseling_yuni_07_3,But what's the point of tying a knot if you don't make it tight?
d_counseling_yuni_07_4,"Even if it breaks, the cookies are still cookies. No harm no foul."
d_counseling_yuni_07_5,"You should tie Mihara up, too."
d_counseling_yuni_07_6,"No, Commander. Once it breaks, it is no longer the same."
d_counseling_yuni_07_7,It can never return to what it was before.
d_counseling_yuni_07_8,... Yes.
d_counseling_yuni_07_9,"Since Mihara punished me, I'll just have to punish her back."
d_counseling_yuni_07_10,Yuni teaches me how to tie a knot.
d_counseling_yuni_08_1,Commander.
d_counseling_yuni_08_2,"How would you feel if someone suddenly hit you, out of the blue?"
d_counseling_yuni_08_3,One-sided violence is never good.
d_counseling_yuni_08_4,I would want to retaliate.
d_counseling_yuni_08_5,"Yes, I feel the same way."
d_counseling_yuni_08_6,There needs to be mutual consent when it comes to these things.
d_counseling_yuni_08_7,"Speaking of, would you... consent to that kind of arrangement?"
d_counseling_yuni_08_8,Ha ha! I see you're the type who doesn't like to lose.
d_counseling_yuni_08_9,"But, surely there's a better option than just retaliation?"
d_counseling_yuni_08_10,Yuni and I explore the philosophy behind hitting others.
d_counseling_yuni_09_1,My precious handcuffs! They're broken...
d_counseling_yuni_09_2,I had them for so long...
d_counseling_yuni_09_3,Should I buy a new pair?
d_counseling_yuni_09_4,I'll buy you an identical pair.
d_counseling_yuni_09_5,Is it really that big a deal that the handcuffs are broken?
d_counseling_yuni_09_6,Hm... No. It's okay.
d_counseling_yuni_09_7,It wouldn't be the same.
d_counseling_yuni_09_8,I'll just have to fix these ones.
d_counseling_yuni_09_9,...!!
d_counseling_yuni_09_10,You're right! It doesn't really matter if the handcuffs work or not.
d_counseling_yuni_09_11,They're just a prop. The important thing is who you put them on.
d_counseling_yuni_09_12,Yuni tells me about her most treasured possessions.
d_counseling_yuni_10_1,"Commander, what kind of hit hurts the most?"
d_counseling_yuni_10_2,A hit to the shins? A punch to the gut? Stubbing your toe?
d_counseling_yuni_10_3,"I haven't been hit that much, so I really can't say."
d_counseling_yuni_10_4,It hurts no matter where you get hit.
d_counseling_yuni_10_5,Ha ha! You're right.
d_counseling_yuni_10_6,"Then, would you let me teach you...?"
d_counseling_yuni_10_7,No way. They can't all be the same.
d_counseling_yuni_10_8,"Commander, you're either lying, or you really don't know anything."
d_counseling_yuni_10_9,But that's not a problem. Just let me teach you...
d_counseling_yuni_10_10,Yuni teaches me a lot of things.
d_counseling_yuni_11_1,Commander.
d_counseling_yuni_11_2,What would you say is my strong suit?
d_counseling_yuni_11_3,"You're pure of heart, and kind."
d_counseling_yuni_11_4,You're adorable.
d_counseling_yuni_11_5,"Hehe,"
d_counseling_yuni_11_6,Mihara said the same thing.
d_counseling_yuni_11_7,I'm glad that you feel the same way she does.
d_counseling_yuni_11_8,Being cute is not a strength.
d_counseling_yuni_11_9,It seems you don't know me that well.
d_counseling_yuni_11_10,Yuni and I have a conversation about her strengths.
d_counseling_yuni_12_1,"Commander, have you ever drank a cocktail before?"
d_counseling_yuni_12_2,"I really want to try one, but Mihara says I'm still too young."
d_counseling_yuni_12_3,What does it taste like?
d_counseling_yuni_12_4,"When you're a little older, we can go try a few together."
d_counseling_yuni_12_5,They taste... as if they have an air of danger to them. It's all very adult.
d_counseling_yuni_12_6,That'd be great.
d_counseling_yuni_12_7,Um...
d_counseling_yuni_12_8,Could Mihara come with us too?
d_counseling_yuni_12_9,How intriguing...
d_counseling_yuni_12_10,I'm not sure how I'd handle it.
d_counseling_yuni_12_11,I explain more about cocktails to Yuni.
d_counseling_yuni_13_1,Mihara...
d_counseling_yuni_13_2,means the world to me.
d_counseling_yuni_13_3,I'm sure Mihara likes you as well.
d_counseling_yuni_13_4,She means the world to me too.
d_counseling_yuni_13_5,You think so?
d_counseling_yuni_13_6,Mihara likes me too...
d_counseling_yuni_13_7,I'm happy to hear you say that.
d_counseling_yuni_13_8,Wait...
d_counseling_yuni_13_9,You mean you like Mihara more than me?
d_counseling_yuni_13_10,Yuni and I talk about Mihara.
d_counseling_yuni_14_1,...
d_counseling_yuni_14_2,I'd prefer to be alone today.
d_counseling_yuni_14_3,Caress her hair.
d_counseling_yuni_14_4,Take out a candy.
d_counseling_yuni_14_5,...
d_counseling_yuni_14_6,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_yuni_14_7,I feel much better.
d_counseling_yuni_14_8,I am not in the mood for candy.
d_counseling_yuni_14_9,I'm feeling down today.
d_counseling_yuni_14_10,I try my best to make Yuni feel better.
d_counseling_yuni_15_1,Commander...
d_counseling_yuni_15_2,"I'm not bothering you by talking to you every day, am I?"
d_counseling_yuni_15_3,"You've never bothered me, not even once."
d_counseling_yuni_15_4,"Honestly, sometimes it's a bit too much."
d_counseling_yuni_15_5,"Hehe, that's good."
d_counseling_yuni_15_6,I was worried you might find it irritating...
d_counseling_yuni_15_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_yuni_15_8,"So it's somewhat difficult for you to handle, is that it?"
d_counseling_yuni_15_9,But I like spending time with you.
d_counseling_yuni_15_10,Yuni and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_yuni_16_1,"Commander, give me your hand."
d_counseling_yuni_16_2,I want to show you something fun.
d_counseling_yuni_16_3,You reach out your hand.
d_counseling_yuni_16_4,You reach out with your foot.
d_counseling_yuni_16_5,Yuni slaps your hand.
d_counseling_yuni_16_6,*Wazzzzzzuuuuup*
d_counseling_yuni_16_7,"Hehe, isn't that great?"
d_counseling_yuni_16_8,"Commander, what are you doing?"
d_counseling_yuni_16_9,That's not your hand... is it?
d_counseling_yuni_16_10,"Yuni asked me again to reach out my hand, but I refused."
d_counseling_yuni_17_1,"Commander, I don't want to go to orientation."
d_counseling_yuni_17_2,"I pick things up by doing them, not hearing about them."
d_counseling_yuni_17_3,Do I really have to go?
d_counseling_yuni_17_4,It's important to read up on things you're learning as well.
d_counseling_yuni_17_5,Anything worth learning can be learned on the battlefield. You don't have to go.
d_counseling_yuni_17_6,... Mihara said the exact same thing...
d_counseling_yuni_17_7,"Fine, I'll go."
d_counseling_yuni_17_8,"Really, I don't have to go?"
d_counseling_yuni_17_9,But Mihara said I had to...
d_counseling_yuni_17_10,"If I skip orientation, Syuen will..."
d_counseling_yuni_17_11,I'm so confused. I don't know what to do.
d_counseling_yuni_17_12,"Yuni suddenly seemed downcast, so I consoled her."
d_counseling_yuni_18_1,Hmm... Mmm...
d_counseling_yuni_18_2,Yuni was fiddling around with the whip.
d_counseling_yuni_18_3,Commander.
d_counseling_yuni_18_4,Do you like me?
d_counseling_yuni_18_5,"Yes, I do."
d_counseling_yuni_18_6,Before we talk... could you put the whip down?
d_counseling_yuni_18_7,That's a relief!
d_counseling_yuni_18_8,I thought you didn't like me. It felt like you were avoiding me.
d_counseling_yuni_18_9,"I like you as well, Commander."
d_counseling_yuni_18_10,Say what?
d_counseling_yuni_18_11,What about the whip?
d_counseling_yuni_18_12,I'm starting to think you care about this whip more than you do about me.
d_counseling_yuni_18_13,"I speak a little more with Yuni, attempting the entire time to convince her to drop the whip."
d_counseling_yuni_19_1,I'm so exhausted...
d_counseling_yuni_19_2,You can go and sleep.
d_counseling_yuni_19_3,Do you want to sleep here?
d_counseling_yuni_19_4,I don't feel like leaving.
d_counseling_yuni_19_5,I want to sleep here.
d_counseling_yuni_19_6,Is it okay?
d_counseling_yuni_19_7,"Hehe, you're the best, Commander."
d_counseling_yuni_19_8,I'll sleep here.
d_counseling_yuni_19_9,Yuni fell asleep on the sofa.
d_counseling_yuni_20_1,Mihara says a hobby is something that makes you happy.
d_counseling_yuni_20_2,"Commander, when are you most happy?"
d_counseling_yuni_20_3,When I'm spending time with you.
d_counseling_yuni_20_4,When I'm spending time with Mihara.
d_counseling_yuni_20_5,You enjoy spending time with me?
d_counseling_yuni_20_6,I'm happiest when I'm around you and Mihara.
d_counseling_yuni_20_7,But...
d_counseling_yuni_20_8,What about me?
d_counseling_yuni_20_9,Do you not enjoy spending time with me?
d_counseling_yuni_20_10,I have a conversation with Yuni about what makes us happy.
d_counseling_vesti_01_1,C-Commander.
d_counseling_vesti_01_2,What do I need to do... to not be n-nervous in front of people?
d_counseling_vesti_01_3,Imagine that the people are Raptures.
d_counseling_vesti_01_4,Be aware of your own cuteness.
d_counseling_vesti_01_5,But th-then I would want to kill all of them.
d_counseling_vesti_01_6,Still... it is better than shaking in nervousness.
d_counseling_vesti_01_7,...!
d_counseling_vesti_01_8,C-cute? Me?
d_counseling_vesti_01_9,I'm not sure if you are making fun of me...
d_counseling_vesti_01_10,But... Thank you.
d_counseling_vesti_01_11,I spend a happy and warm counseling time with Vesti.
d_counseling_vesti_02_1,E-Emma keeps trying to give me unappetizing food.
d_counseling_vesti_02_2,How should I decline?
d_counseling_vesti_02_3,Blame it on a diet.
d_counseling_vesti_02_4,Make Emma taste her own food.
d_counseling_vesti_02_5,B-but...
d_counseling_vesti_02_6,Then I can't let Emma see me eat anything unhealthy at all.
d_counseling_vesti_02_7,"S-still, thanks for the advice."
d_counseling_vesti_02_8,!!
d_counseling_vesti_02_9,I-I will try that today!
d_counseling_vesti_02_10,I should have thought of that before...
d_counseling_vesti_02_11,I have a meaningful counseling time with Vesti.
d_counseling_vesti_03_1,"Commander, I..."
d_counseling_vesti_03_2,I keep having n-nightmares these days.
d_counseling_vesti_03_3,It's a dream about a murderer coming to the school... and no one survives.
d_counseling_vesti_03_4,H-how can I make it stop?
d_counseling_vesti_03_5,Kill the murderer.
d_counseling_vesti_03_6,"Close your eyes for 3 seconds, then open them again."
d_counseling_vesti_03_7,Uh... But...
d_counseling_vesti_03_8,What if... the murderer... is me?
d_counseling_vesti_03_9,!!
d_counseling_vesti_03_10,"Okay. If I do that, then I can s-stop killing all the students?"
d_counseling_vesti_03_11,... Thank you. It was a good idea to consult you.
d_counseling_vesti_03_12,I have a meaningful counseling time with Vesti.
d_counseling_vesti_04_1,Hey... um...
d_counseling_vesti_04_2,Do you have an i-ideal type?
d_counseling_vesti_04_3,Someone small and cute.
d_counseling_vesti_04_4,Someone tall and mature.
d_counseling_vesti_04_5,R-really?
d_counseling_vesti_04_6,Oh my. Then I h-have a chance...!
d_counseling_vesti_04_7,Hm... As I thought.
d_counseling_vesti_04_8,"You like mature women, like Emma..."
d_counseling_vesti_04_9,I have a meaningful counseling time with Vesti.
d_counseling_vesti_05_1,I am trying to keep a diary these days.
d_counseling_vesti_05_2,"But, I'm worried, because my writing is so ugly..."
d_counseling_vesti_05_3,It might be prettier than you think. Let me see it.
d_counseling_vesti_05_4,"In the modern, digital age, handwriting isn't important at all."
d_counseling_vesti_05_5,R-really?
d_counseling_vesti_05_6,Th-then I will bring it next time!
d_counseling_vesti_05_7,"... Don't read it, just look at the writing. Pinky-swear that you promise not to read it...!"
d_counseling_vesti_05_8,H-huh?
d_counseling_vesti_05_9,That's... a kind of complicated answer...
d_counseling_vesti_05_10,"A-anyway, thanks. ... You are trying to comfort me, right?"
d_counseling_vesti_05_11,I listen to Vesti's small problems.
d_counseling_vesti_06_1,... I'm worried because I cry too easily.
d_counseling_vesti_06_2,"I cry when I watch something scary, or something gloomy."
d_counseling_vesti_06_3,"When I hear something even a little b-bad, my tears start coming out..."
d_counseling_vesti_06_4,H-how can I fix this?
d_counseling_vesti_06_5,There is no need to fix it. It's a natural thing.
d_counseling_vesti_06_6,Think about something happy.
d_counseling_vesti_06_7,Uh... O-okay.
d_counseling_vesti_06_8,Huh...? Why am I tearing up again...
d_counseling_vesti_06_9,May because I've never heard that from anyone else.
d_counseling_vesti_06_10,But...
d_counseling_vesti_06_11,"When I get so worked up, it's hard to think about anything else."
d_counseling_vesti_06_12,I listen to Vesti's troubles for a while.
d_counseling_vesti_07_1,B-by any chance...
d_counseling_vesti_07_2,Do you have your own way of relieving stress?
d_counseling_vesti_07_3,I play games.
d_counseling_vesti_07_4,I go out and be social.
d_counseling_vesti_07_5,...!
d_counseling_vesti_07_6,I-I see.
d_counseling_vesti_07_7,I don't think that will work for me. I'm not good at gaming...
d_counseling_vesti_07_8,D-does that really relieve stress?
d_counseling_vesti_07_9,It does the opposite for me...
d_counseling_vesti_07_10,"Of course, y-you are different, though."
d_counseling_vesti_07_11,I listen to Vesti's small problems.
d_counseling_vesti_08_1,...
d_counseling_vesti_08_2,Vesti looks upset.
d_counseling_vesti_08_3,Do you have any complaints?
d_counseling_vesti_08_4,I am sorry I haven't been able to spend time with you these days.
d_counseling_vesti_08_5,N-no!
d_counseling_vesti_08_6,How could I possibly have any c-complaints for you...
d_counseling_vesti_08_7,N-no!
d_counseling_vesti_08_8,I know very well already.
d_counseling_vesti_08_9,You have a lot of Nikkes to look after besides me.
d_counseling_vesti_08_10,I comfort Vesti for a while longer.
d_counseling_vesti_09_1,"... If you had someone you hate so much that you wanted to destroy them, what would you do?"
d_counseling_vesti_09_2,Find the right moment to strike.
d_counseling_vesti_09_3,Ignore it and think about something else.
d_counseling_vesti_09_4,H-huh?!
d_counseling_vesti_09_5,Are you telling me not to put up with it?
d_counseling_vesti_09_6,... I-I know I should do that.
d_counseling_vesti_09_7,"But soon after, I will imagine killing them again."
d_counseling_vesti_09_8,"Even though no matter how much I kill them, what they did to me won't change."
d_counseling_vesti_09_9,I listen to Vesti's troubles for a while.
d_counseling_vesti_10_1,...
d_counseling_vesti_10_2,I want to have a counseling session with you every day.
d_counseling_vesti_10_3,Do you have a lot of worries recently?
d_counseling_vesti_10_4,"I enjoy having counseling time with you, too."
d_counseling_vesti_10_5,Y-yes...
d_counseling_vesti_10_6,"That's true too, but..."
d_counseling_vesti_10_7,I just like spending time with you.
d_counseling_vesti_10_8,R-really?
d_counseling_vesti_10_9,Wh-wh-what should I do? I'm so happy right now!
d_counseling_vesti_10_10,I spend a happy and warm counseling time with Vesti.
d_counseling_vesti_11_1,Commander...
d_counseling_vesti_11_2,is there anything you only do with people that you're close to?
d_counseling_vesti_11_3,"Being at ease while I talk with them, like right now."
d_counseling_vesti_11_4,Talking with them on Bla every single day.
d_counseling_vesti_11_5,"So, would you consider us to be close?"
d_counseling_vesti_11_6,More than that... do you feel comfortable around me?
d_counseling_vesti_11_7,I'm so happy to hear that.
d_counseling_vesti_11_8,Oh... um... in that case...
d_counseling_vesti_11_9,Can I send you a message every day from now on?
d_counseling_vesti_11_10,Vesti and I have a lovely discussion.
d_counseling_vesti_12_1,... Commander.
d_counseling_vesti_12_2,What's your favorite movie genre?
d_counseling_vesti_12_3,Horror movies that make you jump out of your seat.
d_counseling_vesti_12_4,Animated movies with cute characters.
d_counseling_vesti_12_5,H-how can you watch something like that?
d_counseling_vesti_12_6,Going to watch a movie like that seems like a waste of money...
d_counseling_vesti_12_7,You have a soft spot for cute and cuddly creatures as well?
d_counseling_vesti_12_8,That makes two of us!
d_counseling_vesti_12_9,"Great minds think alike, hehe."
d_counseling_vesti_12_10,I spend time with Vesti talking about movies we want to watch.
d_counseling_vesti_13_1,Commander...
d_counseling_vesti_13_2,have you ever had a crush on someone?
d_counseling_vesti_13_3,"Yes, I have."
d_counseling_vesti_13_4,"No, I haven't."
d_counseling_vesti_13_5,What? You have?
d_counseling_vesti_13_6,I see...
d_counseling_vesti_13_7,Y-you don't have to say anymore...
d_counseling_vesti_13_8,You've never been in love with someone before?
d_counseling_vesti_13_9,I'm glad... So glad...
d_counseling_vesti_13_10,Vesti and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_vesti_14_1,Can I ask you something?
d_counseling_vesti_14_2,What do you do when you are overwhelmed with loneliness?
d_counseling_vesti_14_3,I write in my journal to try and give words to my feelings.
d_counseling_vesti_14_4,I enjoy that feeling and revel in it.
d_counseling_vesti_14_5,So you like writing in your journal as well?
d_counseling_vesti_14_6,I think it's a wonderful thing.
d_counseling_vesti_14_7,It helps keep the loneliness at bay...
d_counseling_vesti_14_8,"... You're strange, Commander."
d_counseling_vesti_14_9,Who would enjoy feeling that way?
d_counseling_vesti_14_10,I spend time with Vesti talking about loneliness.
d_counseling_vesti_15_1,"Commander, when you and I have our discussions,"
d_counseling_vesti_15_2,what are you thinking about?
d_counseling_vesti_15_3,About you.
d_counseling_vesti_15_4,Not much.
d_counseling_vesti_15_5,...!!!
d_counseling_vesti_15_6,Me...?
d_counseling_vesti_15_7,W-what's going on?! I can feel my face burning up.
d_counseling_vesti_15_8,...
d_counseling_vesti_15_9,"To be honest, your answer makes me a little sad..."
d_counseling_vesti_15_10,Vesti and I have a lovely discussion.
d_counseling_vesti_16_1,Do you make any resolutions for the new year?
d_counseling_vesti_16_2,To forge a greater bond with you.
d_counseling_vesti_16_3,Not really.
d_counseling_vesti_16_4,W-with me?
d_counseling_vesti_16_5,Hehe. You and I are already so close...
d_counseling_vesti_16_6,If we got any closer then it'd be...l-love?!
d_counseling_vesti_16_7,Oh...
d_counseling_vesti_16_8,I thought you would have set some goals for yourself.
d_counseling_vesti_16_9,That's too bad you don't have one...
d_counseling_vesti_16_10,I have a conversation with Vesti about our goals for this year.
d_counseling_vesti_17_1,Decorating your diary is all the rage right now.
d_counseling_vesti_17_2,What do you think about people decorating their diaries?
d_counseling_vesti_17_3,I think it's cute.
d_counseling_vesti_17_4,The two of us can do it together.
d_counseling_vesti_17_5,That's great!
d_counseling_vesti_17_6,I'm glad that you feel that way.
d_counseling_vesti_17_7,I guess I made the right choice in following the trend.
d_counseling_vesti_17_8,You and me? Together?
d_counseling_vesti_17_9,I'm not sure that's a good idea... We'd have to show each other our diaries.
d_counseling_vesti_17_10,I have a conversation with Vesti about diaries.
d_counseling_vesti_18_1,"Commander, if someone hurt your feelings, how would you respond?"
d_counseling_vesti_18_2,Is there a way to keep your feelings from being hurt?
d_counseling_vesti_18_3,"Whatever they did to me, I'd do the same thing right back at them."
d_counseling_vesti_18_4,I wouldn't let it get me down and just move on.
d_counseling_vesti_18_5,But then you're no better than they are!
d_counseling_vesti_18_6,I don't think that's right...
d_counseling_vesti_18_7,I wouldn't feel good about it.
d_counseling_vesti_18_8,That's probably the best way to go about it.
d_counseling_vesti_18_9,I'll try my best from now on not to let these things get to me.
d_counseling_vesti_18_10,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_vesti_18_11,I gave Vesti more advice on how to let insults roll off your back.
d_counseling_vesti_19_1,What do you do when you really want to possess someone?
d_counseling_vesti_19_2,There this person... and I want them all for myself.
d_counseling_vesti_19_3,"The more you obsess about someone, the more you'll just drive them away."
d_counseling_vesti_19_4,And who is this person?
d_counseling_vesti_19_5,"Right... if I overstep any boundaries, they might end up leaving..."
d_counseling_vesti_19_6,I can't have that happen.
d_counseling_vesti_19_7,I'll just try and hide my true feelings when I'm around them.
d_counseling_vesti_19_8,... I-I can't tell you that right now.
d_counseling_vesti_19_9,So don't bother asking me!
d_counseling_vesti_19_10,I advised Vesti on how to avoid driving away from the object of her affection.
d_counseling_vesti_20_1,"Commander, of all the Nikkes in Absolute,"
d_counseling_vesti_20_2,who do you like the most? Who are you most comfortable being around?
d_counseling_vesti_20_3,"You're my favorite, and I'm most comfortable around you."
d_counseling_vesti_20_4,I don't know... Emma?
d_counseling_vesti_20_5,R-really?
d_counseling_vesti_20_6,You aren't just saying that because I'm here?
d_counseling_vesti_20_7,I feel the same way about you.
d_counseling_vesti_20_8,Huh? Emma?
d_counseling_vesti_20_9,I have to admit... I'm a little jealous.
d_counseling_vesti_20_10,Vesti and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_yan_01_1,"Hey, Rookie."
d_counseling_yan_01_2,What do I need to do to sell products to people like you?
d_counseling_yan_01_3,Use your beauty.
d_counseling_yan_01_4,Give a 75% discount.
d_counseling_yan_01_5,"Oh, my beauty?"
d_counseling_yan_01_6,"Come over here, then. I will do anything you ask of me."
d_counseling_yan_01_7,I step toward Yan and get smacked with a fan.
d_counseling_yan_01_8,I didn't know you drove such a hard bargain.
d_counseling_yan_01_9,A 75% discount is like letting me give it to you for free.
d_counseling_yan_01_10,How about... around 45% discount? That way it's a win-win for both of us.
d_counseling_yan_01_12,I spend materialistic counseling time with Yan.
d_counseling_yan_02_1,"Businesses should be honest. If not, you will be punished."
d_counseling_yan_02_2,You should remind Dolla of that.
d_counseling_yan_02_3,Understood.
d_counseling_yan_02_4,You should let Dolla walk her own path.
d_counseling_yan_02_5,Thanks.
d_counseling_yan_02_6,"Having a colleague in the squad who is an economic criminal could cause problems, if left unchecked."
d_counseling_yan_02_7,You...
d_counseling_yan_02_8,"... Never mind. Since you're the commander, we'll do what you decide."
d_counseling_yan_02_9,"But if her bad deeds come back to bite her on the butt, then you'll take half the blame."
d_counseling_yan_02_10,I talk with Yan about squad colleagues.
d_counseling_yan_03_1,"Hey, Rookie."
d_counseling_yan_03_2,Is there anything you want to eat right now?
d_counseling_yan_03_3,500g of the finest pork chop.
d_counseling_yan_03_4,"Anything is okay, if it's from you."
d_counseling_yan_03_5,What is that?
d_counseling_yan_03_6,How can it be so specific?
d_counseling_yan_03_7,... Oh?
d_counseling_yan_03_8,"Well, I wasn't going to give you anything at first..."
d_counseling_yan_03_9,"... But for your sweet words, I'm gonna send you a special product."
d_counseling_yan_03_10,I talk with Yan about the foods we like.
d_counseling_yan_04_1,Rupee keeps trying to get me to make an appearance on her broadcast.
d_counseling_yan_04_2,What should I do with her?
d_counseling_yan_04_3,Demand an appropriate share of the profit.
d_counseling_yan_04_4,"Just do it. She's your friend and squad mate, after all."
d_counseling_yan_04_5,Ah. Great minds really do think alike.
d_counseling_yan_04_6,I should get at least 30% of the ad profit.
d_counseling_yan_04_7,"Then I'll buy an ad for our company, and it'll be even."
d_counseling_yan_04_8,What in the world are you talking about?
d_counseling_yan_04_9,"Don't you know that the closer you are, the more clear you have to be about financial matters?"
d_counseling_yan_04_10,I talk with Yan about squad colleagues.
d_counseling_yan_05_1,"... Rookie, come over here."
d_counseling_yan_05_2,Do you want to be my secretary?
d_counseling_yan_05_3,What are the conditions?
d_counseling_yan_05_4,I decline.
d_counseling_yan_05_5,The salary will be almost four times what you get now.
d_counseling_yan_05_6,"Also, if the sales go up, I'll give you an incentive. Up to a maximum of 300% of your salary."
d_counseling_yan_05_7,You don't even have to do much. Just stay by my side and smile.
d_counseling_yan_05_8,"... I almost fall for it, but come to my senses after hearing the last part."
d_counseling_yan_05_9,You are going to decline without even hearing the conditions?
d_counseling_yan_05_10,... That is a shame.
d_counseling_yan_05_11,I politely decline Yan's recruitment offer.
d_counseling_yan_06_1,I heard there's a lot of valuable stuff on the surface.
d_counseling_yan_06_2,"Did you bring back anything, by any chance?"
d_counseling_yan_06_3,Just some sand.
d_counseling_yan_06_4,Some Rapture parts.
d_counseling_yan_06_5,...
d_counseling_yan_06_6,Are you kidding me?
d_counseling_yan_06_7,...!
d_counseling_yan_06_8,That... is in good condition. And the material... it's hard to find on the Ark.
d_counseling_yan_06_9,"Rookie. If you find things like that from now on, bring them to me."
d_counseling_yan_06_10,Understand? Not to Dolla. Not to Rupee. Straight to me.
d_counseling_yan_06_11,I talk with Yan about the treasures on the surface.
d_counseling_yan_07_1,"According to the intelligence services, the weather is bad on the surface today."
d_counseling_yan_07_2,Don't you think you should prepare something?
d_counseling_yan_07_3,"Like an umbrella, or a raincoat."
d_counseling_yan_07_4,What's your asking price?
d_counseling_yan_07_5,Another gimmick...
d_counseling_yan_07_6,"Oh, it's a little expensive if you only buy one."
d_counseling_yan_07_7,"But if you buy umbrellas and raincoats for all six Nikkes going on the operation, a 30% discount can be applied."
d_counseling_yan_07_8,"And you can't tell anyone else. Since you and I are so close, you know..."
d_counseling_yan_07_9,I will give you a special additional boss discount of 10%.
d_counseling_yan_07_10,"What do you mean, gimmick?"
d_counseling_yan_07_11,"What if you got soaked by rain, or got sick? You'll regret the money you tried to save."
d_counseling_yan_07_12,"So buy now, before it's too late!"
d_counseling_yan_07_13,I eventually fall for Yan's gimmick.
d_counseling_yan_08_1,"Hey, Rookie."
d_counseling_yan_08_2,What do you think of Nikkes who talk with an accent?
d_counseling_yan_08_3,Sounds cute.
d_counseling_yan_08_4,Sounds strong.
d_counseling_yan_08_5,Huh?!
d_counseling_yan_08_6,Cute?
d_counseling_yan_08_7,...
d_counseling_yan_08_8,"I was thinking if you said you didn't like it, I'd try to change it."
d_counseling_yan_08_9,But it looks like I don't have to change a thing.
d_counseling_yan_08_10,...
d_counseling_yan_08_11,Uh... Why?
d_counseling_yan_08_12,I guess it might seem that way when arguing...
d_counseling_yan_08_13,"But, I've never raised my voice in front of you!"
d_counseling_yan_08_14,I talk with Yan about her accent.
d_counseling_yan_09_1,Your favorite color.
d_counseling_yan_09_2,What is it? Tell me.
d_counseling_yan_09_3,Yellow.
d_counseling_yan_09_4,Red.
d_counseling_yan_09_5,Yellow...
d_counseling_yan_09_6,Just like Rupee.
d_counseling_yan_09_7,... Hm.
d_counseling_yan_09_8,"Oh, red?"
d_counseling_yan_09_9,Then we're like two peas in a pod.
d_counseling_yan_09_10,... Do you want to dress in red? Then we can look like a couple.
d_counseling_yan_09_11,I have a small talk with Yan.
d_counseling_yan_10_1,What do you think I'll be doing in 10 years?
d_counseling_yan_10_2,You'll be monopolizing Ark's economy.
d_counseling_yan_10_3,You'll be expanding your business on the surface.
d_counseling_yan_10_4,... I'm doing that already. Even though it's limited to living necessities.
d_counseling_yan_10_5,Which is to say... there isn't anything particularly new.
d_counseling_yan_10_6,... That's the best answer I've heard so far.
d_counseling_yan_10_7,"Even if it's based on the premise that the surface needs to be recaptured,"
d_counseling_yan_10_8,"having worked in the business for years, I'm sure I could do it."
d_counseling_yan_10_9,I discuss the future with Yan.
d_counseling_yan_11_1,"In your opinion,"
d_counseling_yan_11_2,what is the most important factor in success?
d_counseling_yan_11_3,Perseverance.
d_counseling_yan_11_4,Luck.
d_counseling_yan_11_5,Effort?
d_counseling_yan_11_6,That's what I figured you would say.
d_counseling_yan_11_7,But no amount of perseverance will beat out luck.
d_counseling_yan_11_8,"Except for me, of course."
d_counseling_yan_11_9,We're on the same page in that respect.
d_counseling_yan_11_10,I think just enough money and a bit of luck will help take you to the top.
d_counseling_yan_11_11,But I think I would have succeeded without it.
d_counseling_yan_11_12,Yan and I have a discussion about success.
d_counseling_yan_12_1,There have been a lot of new TV shows about relationships.
d_counseling_yan_12_2,Do you have a lot of dating experience?
d_counseling_yan_12_3,I've been single my entire life.
d_counseling_yan_12_4,I once had 12 relationships in a single day.
d_counseling_yan_12_5,!!
d_counseling_yan_12_6,"Wait, really?"
d_counseling_yan_12_7,You've never been in a relationship?
d_counseling_yan_12_8,"I didn't expect that from you! But nevertheless, I like your answer."
d_counseling_yan_12_9,... Come again?
d_counseling_yan_12_10,"You're not serious, are you?"
d_counseling_yan_12_11,You're completely psychotic!
d_counseling_yan_12_12,Yan and I talk about relationships.
d_counseling_yan_13_1,"Tell me,"
d_counseling_yan_13_2,has anything caught your eye as of late?
d_counseling_yan_13_3,I want to make a note of it for when I release my next product.
d_counseling_yan_13_4,You've caught my eye.
d_counseling_yan_13_5,There isn't really anything I'm interested in.
d_counseling_yan_13_6,Go on. Is there something you want from me?
d_counseling_yan_13_7,I'm all ears.
d_counseling_yan_13_8,"A word of advice, Rookie: never start a business."
d_counseling_yan_13_9,"With your mindset, you'll be bankrupt before the first quarter is over."
d_counseling_yan_13_10,Yan and I talk about what interests us.
d_counseling_yan_14_1,"We just released a new flavor of soda, want to try it?"
d_counseling_yan_14_2,Is it free?
d_counseling_yan_14_3,I'm willing to try anything you offer me.
d_counseling_yan_14_4,Nothing's free in this world.
d_counseling_yan_14_5,But I may reconsider if you do something that amuses me.
d_counseling_yan_14_6,Is that true?
d_counseling_yan_14_7,"I have to say, that's a nice little confidence booster."
d_counseling_yan_14_8,"If you like it, just let me know. I'll give you as much as you want."
d_counseling_yan_14_9,"Thanks to Yan, I won't have to pay for any sodas in the near future."
d_counseling_yan_15_1,I run into a lot of irate customers on the job.
d_counseling_yan_15_2,Some of them really cross the line.
d_counseling_yan_15_3,I'll take care of them for you.
d_counseling_yan_15_4,You should give it right back to them.
d_counseling_yan_15_5,"Aw shucks, Rookie."
d_counseling_yan_15_6,"Thank you, even if you're just saying that."
d_counseling_yan_15_7,That's easier said than done.
d_counseling_yan_15_8,"Besides, I don't want to stoop down to their level."
d_counseling_yan_15_9,I listen to more of Yan's customer service nightmare stories.
d_counseling_yan_16_1,"When you look at me, what words pop in your head?"
d_counseling_yan_16_2,A businesswoman who doesn't take crap from anyone.
d_counseling_yan_16_3,An entrepreneur.
d_counseling_yan_16_4,You actually feel that way about me?
d_counseling_yan_16_5,That's fantastic.
d_counseling_yan_16_6,...
d_counseling_yan_16_7,"I mean, it is true that I'm an entrepreneur..."
d_counseling_yan_16_8,"Anyway, it's okay I guess."
d_counseling_yan_16_9,I continue to think of suitable ways to describe Yan.
d_counseling_yan_17_1,"Are you someone who enjoys challenges themselves,"
d_counseling_yan_17_2,or do you prefer having a sense of stability?
d_counseling_yan_17_3,I enjoy challenging myself
d_counseling_yan_17_4,I enjoy a sense of stability
d_counseling_yan_17_5,That's a good mindset to have.
d_counseling_yan_17_6,You have to keep challenging yourself to grow.
d_counseling_yan_17_7,That's how I operate as well.
d_counseling_yan_17_8,"Stability is nice, but if you're not careful, it can make you settle for less."
d_counseling_yan_17_9,You should work on challenging yourself.
d_counseling_yan_17_10,Yan and I share a meaningful conversation.
d_counseling_yan_18_1,Is there anything you've seen recently that you want to get your hands on?
d_counseling_yan_18_2,Yan's heart.
d_counseling_yan_18_3,Luxury brand watches.
d_counseling_yan_18_4,You've become quite the flirt lately.
d_counseling_yan_18_5,"Well, how do you intend on getting it?"
d_counseling_yan_18_6,Expensive watches?
d_counseling_yan_18_7,I didn't know you were interested in that sort of thing.
d_counseling_yan_18_8,Consider me surprised.
d_counseling_yan_18_9,Yan and I talk about the things we want the most.
d_counseling_yan_19_1,Rookie. Have you ever failed at something before?
d_counseling_yan_19_2,What's your definition of failure?
d_counseling_yan_19_3,Failure is just another opportunity to try again.
d_counseling_yan_19_4,I wouldn't know. I've never failed before.
d_counseling_yan_19_5,Hmm... that sounds about right to me.
d_counseling_yan_19_6,"If you fall, you just have to get back up again."
d_counseling_yan_19_7,... Huh?
d_counseling_yan_19_8,So much confidence... I'm at a loss for words.
d_counseling_yan_19_9,You are really something else.
d_counseling_yan_19_10,Yan and talk about failure.
d_counseling_yan_20_1,Do you know much about investing?
d_counseling_yan_20_2,I'm on the hunt for investment opportunities.
d_counseling_yan_20_3,I hate red.
d_counseling_yan_20_4,You're the only thing I want to invest in.
d_counseling_yan_20_5,It looks like you are another victim.
d_counseling_yan_20_6,I don't think I'll be getting any advice from you.
d_counseling_yan_20_7,You know your stuff.
d_counseling_yan_20_8,"If I invest in you, I may not end up bankrupt after all."
d_counseling_yan_20_9,Yan and I searched for companies to invest in.
d_counseling_yulha_01_1,Sigh...
d_counseling_yulha_01_2,Ugh... Why are you staring at me?
d_counseling_yulha_01_3,Do you have a bad hangover?
d_counseling_yulha_01_4,Are you stressed out from work?
d_counseling_yulha_01_5,I see what you were thinking.
d_counseling_yulha_01_6,... Your guess was correct.
d_counseling_yulha_01_7,"If that answers all your questions, then go away. This hangover is killing me."
d_counseling_yulha_01_8,You think I would be like this for something as simple as work?
d_counseling_yulha_01_9,This isn't the first time I've been overworked...
d_counseling_yulha_01_10,"Ugh, just go away, I'm annoyed."
d_counseling_yulha_01_11,I stay away from a sensitive Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_02_1,"These days, I can't help but nag Privaty whenever I see her."
d_counseling_yulha_02_2,"But if I keep doing it, I know she'll get upset..."
d_counseling_yulha_02_3,*Sigh* What should I do?
d_counseling_yulha_02_4,"Still, shouldn't you say what's on your mind?"
d_counseling_yulha_02_5,It might be a good idea to nag a little less.
d_counseling_yulha_02_6,"That's right. I should say what's on my mind, right?"
d_counseling_yulha_02_7,"After all, I'm the one who always cleans up her messes."
d_counseling_yulha_02_8,Don't I deserve a little nag or two?
d_counseling_yulha_02_9,Right... I should try and hold it in. Sure.
d_counseling_yulha_02_10,But I'm the one who's always running around cleaning up her messes!
d_counseling_yulha_02_11,And now I can't even nag?!
d_counseling_yulha_02_12,Ugh! So annoying!
d_counseling_yulha_02_13,I share many sighs with Yulha while talking about Privaty.
d_counseling_yulha_03_1,Admi worries too much.
d_counseling_yulha_03_2,It might be a sign that she is mature...
d_counseling_yulha_03_3,"But I don't think it's good for a kid to be so mature, anyway."
d_counseling_yulha_03_4,Tell her to learn from Privaty how to act like a kid.
d_counseling_yulha_03_5,Give her a vacation and send her to the Outpost.
d_counseling_yulha_03_6,Why is everything you say such nonsense?
d_counseling_yulha_03_7,Admi is already looking down on Privaty these days.
d_counseling_yulha_03_8,Do you think she will want to learn from Privaty?
d_counseling_yulha_03_9,"That's a good idea. You're there, too..."
d_counseling_yulha_03_10,Maybe you can help her relieve some of her stress.
d_counseling_yulha_03_11,I will send her there soon.
d_counseling_yulha_03_12,I worry about Admi with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_04_1,I heard that eating can make stress go away.
d_counseling_yulha_04_2,"So, what should I eat? Something sweet, or something spicy?"
d_counseling_yulha_04_3,Sweet.
d_counseling_yulha_04_4,Spicy.
d_counseling_yulha_04_5,"Hmph, I heard spicy food is better for relieving stress..."
d_counseling_yulha_04_6,"Still, you made a good choice."
d_counseling_yulha_04_7,"I can't eat spicy food, anyway."
d_counseling_yulha_04_8,But I can't eat spicy food.
d_counseling_yulha_04_9,Choose something else.
d_counseling_yulha_04_10,I go back and forth about food choices with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_05_1,I have a favor. Could you try to reign in your Nikkes a little more?
d_counseling_yulha_05_2,"Because of all the troubles you're causing on the surface and the Outpost, the amount of paperwork...!"
d_counseling_yulha_05_3,*Sigh*
d_counseling_yulha_05_4,Okay. I'll be more controlling.
d_counseling_yulha_05_5,"I'm sorry, but that is impossible."
d_counseling_yulha_05_6,Don't make promises you can't keep.
d_counseling_yulha_05_7,I know very well you can't control all those Nikkes.
d_counseling_yulha_05_8,"Not by yourself, anyway."
d_counseling_yulha_05_9,"Oh, yeah? You're not up to the task?"
d_counseling_yulha_05_10,... Fine.
d_counseling_yulha_05_11,You can't possibly control all those Nikkes by yourself.
d_counseling_yulha_05_12,"Admitting your shortcomings is better than making promises you can't keep, anyway."
d_counseling_yulha_05_13,I discuss solutions about the Nikkes at the Outpost with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_06_1,"Hey, Newbie."
d_counseling_yulha_06_2,Do you have somewhere you want to go on your vacation?
d_counseling_yulha_06_3,You think I have time for a vacation?
d_counseling_yulha_06_4,I'll just rest in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_yulha_06_5,You never think about it?
d_counseling_yulha_06_6,"Well, I guess that's true."
d_counseling_yulha_06_7,There's no such thing as a vacation for us...
d_counseling_yulha_06_8,You are going to use your golden vacation days being stuffed inside a room?
d_counseling_yulha_06_9,I didn't think you were so uselessly lazy.
d_counseling_yulha_06_10,"... But I guess it's not bad, either."
d_counseling_yulha_06_11,I imagine a nonexistent vacation with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_07_1,"Newbie, did you ever consider working as a regular soldier for the Central Government?"
d_counseling_yulha_07_2,"Instead of being a Commander, I mean."
d_counseling_yulha_07_3,I did.
d_counseling_yulha_07_4,I didn't.
d_counseling_yulha_07_5,Hm? You did?
d_counseling_yulha_07_6,That's an unexpected answer.
d_counseling_yulha_07_7,"Hm... If you worked below me, I could have bossed you around."
d_counseling_yulha_07_8,What a pity.
d_counseling_yulha_07_9,Right. I knew you would say that.
d_counseling_yulha_07_10,You were born to do this job.
d_counseling_yulha_07_11,I discuss the Central Government with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_08_1,"Every day this horrible, conniving woman keeps getting in my way."
d_counseling_yulha_08_2,How can I get rid of her?
d_counseling_yulha_08_3,"Ask her, ""Do you like me?"""
d_counseling_yulha_08_4,Bite her.
d_counseling_yulha_08_5,No. I don't want to hear her answer.
d_counseling_yulha_08_6,I might even throw up just trying to ask.
d_counseling_yulha_08_7,"Ugh, just thinking about it is making my stomach churn."
d_counseling_yulha_08_8,!!
d_counseling_yulha_08_9,Bite her? With my teeth?
d_counseling_yulha_08_10,... That's not a bad idea.
d_counseling_yulha_08_11,I make plans for getting rid of the conniving woman with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_09_1,"Hey, Newbie."
d_counseling_yulha_09_2,Have you ever realized...
d_counseling_yulha_09_3,"If, one day, our superiors gave the order,"
d_counseling_yulha_09_4,Triangle will execute you?
d_counseling_yulha_09_5,I know.
d_counseling_yulha_09_6,Can't I just pretend it's not true?
d_counseling_yulha_09_7,Then... you still spend your time counseling me?
d_counseling_yulha_09_8,I can't imagine a bigger sucker than you.
d_counseling_yulha_09_9,You stupid fool.
d_counseling_yulha_09_10,You can't afford to pretend.
d_counseling_yulha_09_11,"Someday, my bullet might just be the one that stops your heart."
d_counseling_yulha_09_12,I spend some serious counseling time with Yulha.
d_counseling_yulha_10_1,What is your ideal type?
d_counseling_yulha_10_2,Do any of the Nikkes suit you?
d_counseling_yulha_10_3,Someone like you.
d_counseling_yulha_10_4,I don't think there are any among the Nikkes...
d_counseling_yulha_10_5,!!
d_counseling_yulha_10_6,Y-you fool! What are you saying...?!
d_counseling_yulha_10_7,"If you're joking, I won't let it slide!"
d_counseling_yulha_10_8,None of the Nikkes?
d_counseling_yulha_10_9,What a fool. You have higher standards than expected.
d_counseling_yulha_10_10,Or... Do you not like the Nikkes because they are not human...?
d_counseling_yulha_10_11,I argue with Yulha about ideal types.
d_counseling_yulha_11_1,I've heard that listening to white noise can help you concentrate.
d_counseling_yulha_11_2,Do you think there's any truth to that?
d_counseling_yulha_11_3,For sure.
d_counseling_yulha_11_4,I think it's complete nonsense.
d_counseling_yulha_11_5,If you say so.
d_counseling_yulha_11_6,I personally prefer to work in silence.
d_counseling_yulha_11_7,"If we ever end up sharing the same workspace, things might get uncomfortable."
d_counseling_yulha_11_8,That's what I said!
d_counseling_yulha_11_9,You can concentrate much better in a quiet environment.
d_counseling_yulha_11_10,It's good that this place is as serene as it is.
d_counseling_yulha_11_11,Yulha and I spend some more time talking to each other.
d_counseling_yulha_12_1,Damn this insomnia... I feel like death warmed over.
d_counseling_yulha_12_2,I've heard you can get so tired that you can't even fall asleep.
d_counseling_yulha_12_3,What should I do in a situation like this?
d_counseling_yulha_12_4,I'll sing you a lullaby.
d_counseling_yulha_12_5,Get a prescription for some sleeping pills.
d_counseling_yulha_12_6,I'm not a baby!
d_counseling_yulha_12_7,That won't help me fall asleep!
d_counseling_yulha_12_8,"... Well, I guess it won't hurt to listen to it just once."
d_counseling_yulha_12_9,Hmmm...
d_counseling_yulha_12_10,I don't think this is severe enough to warrant a hospital visit.
d_counseling_yulha_12_11,"But if you think I should, I'll drop by the doctor later."
d_counseling_yulha_12_12,Yulha and I tried to come up with ways to help her fall asleep.
d_counseling_yulha_13_1,Hey...
d_counseling_yulha_13_2,Do... do you think ghosts really exist?
d_counseling_yulha_13_3,"Yes, they do."
d_counseling_yulha_13_4,Of course they don't.
d_counseling_yulha_13_5,But... how do you know that?
d_counseling_yulha_13_6,You don't mean...
d_counseling_yulha_13_7,Have you encountered one before?!
d_counseling_yulha_13_8,"Y-yeah, that's right!"
d_counseling_yulha_13_9,There's no such thing as ghosts.
d_counseling_yulha_13_10,I feel much better.
d_counseling_yulha_13_11,Yulha and I end up spooking each other while we have our discussion.
d_counseling_yulha_14_1,...
d_counseling_yulha_14_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_yulha_14_3,Say something.
d_counseling_yulha_14_4,Don't do anything.
d_counseling_yulha_14_5,...!
d_counseling_yulha_14_6,Argh! Why can't you keep your mouth shut for a second?!
d_counseling_yulha_14_7,Now I have to recalculate everything!
d_counseling_yulha_14_8,All done.
d_counseling_yulha_14_9,Sorry to keep you waiting. It was something urgent.
d_counseling_yulha_14_10,Yulha and I have a conversation about working.
d_counseling_yulha_15_1,"I'm curious,"
d_counseling_yulha_15_2,what kind of weather do you prefer?
d_counseling_yulha_15_3,A rainy day.
d_counseling_yulha_15_4,A sunny day.
d_counseling_yulha_15_5,I personally don't like rainy days.
d_counseling_yulha_15_6,The sound of the raindrops always breaks my concentration.
d_counseling_yulha_15_7,I prefer it to just be overcast.
d_counseling_yulha_15_8,I'm a big fan of sunny weather too.
d_counseling_yulha_15_9,I can concentrate better.
d_counseling_yulha_15_10,But I don't enjoy the glare in my eyes.
d_counseling_yulha_15_11,Yulha and I have a friendly debate about the weather.
d_counseling_yulha_16_1,"Newbie,"
d_counseling_yulha_16_2,is there anything you hope comes true this year?
d_counseling_yulha_16_3,World peace.
d_counseling_yulha_16_4,That you take it easy for a while.
d_counseling_yulha_16_5,Wow. That may be the most far-fetched thing I've heard yet.
d_counseling_yulha_16_6,You need to get your head out of the clouds.
d_counseling_yulha_16_7,You think you can just flip a switch and have world peace?
d_counseling_yulha_16_8,"Ha, so your wish has something to do with me?"
d_counseling_yulha_16_9,I hope for the same thing.
d_counseling_yulha_16_10,"However, if my workload is any indication, I don't see that wish coming true anytime soon."
d_counseling_yulha_16_11,Yulha and I have a conversation about wishes.
d_counseling_yulha_17_1,I love to space out while I'm taking a shower.
d_counseling_yulha_17_2,The only problem is that I can't stay there longer.
d_counseling_yulha_17_3,What do you usually think about when you're in the shower?
d_counseling_yulha_17_4,"Pssh, you think I have time to take a shower?"
d_counseling_yulha_17_5,I don't think about anything.
d_counseling_yulha_17_6,...
d_counseling_yulha_17_7,Yikes. Seems you're going through a rough patch right now.
d_counseling_yulha_17_8,So you're the same as me.
d_counseling_yulha_17_9,The only time I can ever get outside of my head is when I'm in the shower.
d_counseling_yulha_17_10,Yulha and I start talking about our favorite shampoos.
d_counseling_yulha_18_1,I'm sick of drinking coffee whenever I feel tired.
d_counseling_yulha_18_2,I want to drink something new. Is there anything you can recommend?
d_counseling_yulha_18_3,An energy drink.
d_counseling_yulha_18_4,A vitamin drink.
d_counseling_yulha_18_5,"Yeah, that could work..."
d_counseling_yulha_18_6,"All right, I'll try an energy drink today."
d_counseling_yulha_18_7,Blech! Vitamin drinks taste awful.
d_counseling_yulha_18_8,Even your taste buds aren't trustworthy.
d_counseling_yulha_18_9,I'd rather just drink a different type of coffee.
d_counseling_yulha_18_10,Yulha and I continue discussing the topic of drinks.
d_counseling_yulha_19_1,"If you could ask me any questions,"
d_counseling_yulha_19_2,what would you ask?
d_counseling_yulha_19_3,When do you find time to rest?
d_counseling_yulha_19_4,Do you enjoy your job?
d_counseling_yulha_19_5,...
d_counseling_yulha_19_6,Jeez... I'm stumped on the first question.
d_counseling_yulha_19_7,"To be honest, I'm not so sure myself."
d_counseling_yulha_19_8,What's the big idea of asking me such a stupid question?
d_counseling_yulha_19_9,That's it. Question time's over.
d_counseling_yulha_19_10,"Great, now you made me even more stressed!"
d_counseling_yulha_19_11,I am unable to ask Yulha any more questions.
d_counseling_yulha_20_1,"Newbie, why am I so tired?"
d_counseling_yulha_20_2,Because you've been working all day.
d_counseling_yulha_20_3,Because you haven't left the office yet.
d_counseling_yulha_20_4,Exactly right. I have to do it all over again tomorrow as well.
d_counseling_yulha_20_5,They even asked me to work on the weekend.
d_counseling_yulha_20_6,Can you believe it?
d_counseling_yulha_20_7,Let's get one thing straight.
d_counseling_yulha_20_8,I would if I could.
d_counseling_yulha_20_9,Understood?
d_counseling_yulha_20_10,I have a conversation with Yulha about work.
d_counseling_noise_01_1,My throat's been really sore lately.
d_counseling_noise_01_2,Do you know any tricks to keep your throat in good shape?
d_counseling_noise_01_3,Drink a lot of warm water.
d_counseling_noise_01_4,Relax your throat before singing.
d_counseling_noise_01_5,"I actually prefer cold drinks,"
d_counseling_noise_01_6,"but as long as it's good for the throat, I can try something different."
d_counseling_noise_01_7,Thanks for the tip.
d_counseling_noise_01_8,"Thanks for the tip, but relaxing too much can actually be detrimental to your throat."
d_counseling_noise_01_9,Isn't there any other way?
d_counseling_noise_01_10,Noise and I discuss ways a singer can take care of their throat.
d_counseling_noise_02_1,Did you see my comeback show several days ago?
d_counseling_noise_02_2,What'd you think?
d_counseling_noise_02_3,"Sorry, I was out on a mission."
d_counseling_noise_02_4,I'm not so sure about the lighting at the end.
d_counseling_noise_02_5,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_noise_02_6,"It's okay, duty calls, after all. I appreciate you being honest."
d_counseling_noise_02_7,You can watch a rerun of it whenever you have time.
d_counseling_noise_02_8,The lighting?
d_counseling_noise_02_9,The last song was a ballad. They only used 3 fixed lights the entire time.
d_counseling_noise_02_10,... Did you actually watch the show?
d_counseling_noise_02_11,"If you didn't, just say so."
d_counseling_noise_02_12,Noise and I discussed her show.
d_counseling_noise_03_1,I'm curious about your taste in music.
d_counseling_noise_03_2,Whose songs do you usually listen to?
d_counseling_noise_03_3,Your songs.
d_counseling_noise_03_4,Aria's songs.
d_counseling_noise_03_5,Oh... you listen to my songs more?
d_counseling_noise_03_6,I'm touched!
d_counseling_noise_03_7,I'll have to put even more effort into my next song.
d_counseling_noise_03_8,Oh... so you prefer operas?
d_counseling_noise_03_9,"That's a completely different genre, so I don't know much about it. Aria's performances are really beautiful though."
d_counseling_noise_03_10,"Well, looks like I'll need to work harder to make you listen to my songs more often."
d_counseling_noise_03_11,Noise and I discussed music for a while.
d_counseling_noise_04_1,Someone asked me about commercial jingles not long ago.
d_counseling_noise_04_2,"To be honest, I know next to nothing about them."
d_counseling_noise_04_3,Do you think I could pull it off?
d_counseling_noise_04_4,Of course you could.
d_counseling_noise_04_5,There's a first time for everything. Just give it your best shot.
d_counseling_noise_04_6,Really?
d_counseling_noise_04_7,"I appreciate your confidence in me, but what makes you so sure?"
d_counseling_noise_04_8,I don't believe anything in this world is an absolute certainty.
d_counseling_noise_04_9,...!
d_counseling_noise_04_10,"Thank you, Producer."
d_counseling_noise_04_11,I'll do my best.
d_counseling_noise_04_12,I spend some time giving Noise earnest advice.
d_counseling_noise_05_1,"Hey, check this out."
d_counseling_noise_05_2,What do you think?
d_counseling_noise_05_3,Noise plays a song that sounds eerily familiar to one of her own.
d_counseling_noise_05_4,Did someone rip off your song?
d_counseling_noise_05_5,Is this a cover of one of your songs?
d_counseling_noise_05_6,That's right! It's blatant plagiarism.
d_counseling_noise_05_7,Completely unacceptable.
d_counseling_noise_05_8,Can you help me take legal action against them?
d_counseling_noise_05_9,More like a note-for-note imitation.
d_counseling_noise_05_10,The only thing different is the title.
d_counseling_noise_05_11,"This is plagiarism, plain and simple."
d_counseling_noise_05_12,Noise and I examine the copycat song further.
d_counseling_noise_06_1,I've been thinking about writing a song that really represents the Prima Donna group.
d_counseling_noise_06_2,Do you think that'd be a good idea?
d_counseling_noise_06_3,You three all have wildly different styles. You'd end up with a discordant mess.
d_counseling_noise_06_4,You three all have wildly different styles. You'd end up with a song that's full of twists and turns.
d_counseling_noise_06_5,"Yeah, that's what I was worried about..."
d_counseling_noise_06_6,I was just hoping something good might come out of it by chance.
d_counseling_noise_06_7,"But now that you've confirmed my suspicions, I'll lay this idea to rest."
d_counseling_noise_06_8,That's exactly what I was thinking!
d_counseling_noise_06_9,I'll have to look into this further...
d_counseling_noise_06_10,"Just imagine, what if it suddenly becomes a smash hit?"
d_counseling_noise_06_11,Noise and I discussed group songs for a while.
d_counseling_noise_07_1,I wrote a new song.
d_counseling_noise_07_2,I want to release it on the day we take back the surface.
d_counseling_noise_07_3,I just don't know what the title should be.
d_counseling_noise_07_4,Homecoming.
d_counseling_noise_07_5,Until That Day Comes.
d_counseling_noise_07_6,Short and sweet.
d_counseling_noise_07_7,I like it.
d_counseling_noise_07_8,That truly will be the day that we come home.
d_counseling_noise_07_9,"Hmm, I think that title puts a little too much emphasis on waiting."
d_counseling_noise_07_10,It's supposed to be released on the day when it all really comes true.
d_counseling_noise_07_11,"How about we call it ""That Day""?"
d_counseling_noise_07_12,Noise and I discussed song titles as well as our anticipation for the future.
d_counseling_noise_08_1,Ugh...
d_counseling_noise_08_2,I don't know how many days I've been staying up late to practice.
d_counseling_noise_08_3,You should take a nap.
d_counseling_noise_08_4,I'll get you some mint-flavored Splendamin.
d_counseling_noise_08_5,You're probably right.
d_counseling_noise_08_6,I'll just leave for a moment...
d_counseling_noise_08_7,"Thanks, but no thanks."
d_counseling_noise_08_8,"I feel bad cutting into our precious discussion time,"
d_counseling_noise_08_9,but could I go sleep for a while?
d_counseling_noise_08_10,"Since Noise went off to bed, I spent some quiet time by myself."
d_counseling_noise_09_1,"Producer, can I ask you something?"
d_counseling_noise_09_2,My fans are always writing letters to me and sending gifts.
d_counseling_noise_09_3,How should I express my appreciation? What should I do to repay these fans?
d_counseling_noise_09_4,"Shout ""I love you guys!"" to them while on stage."
d_counseling_noise_09_5,Send gifts back to them.
d_counseling_noise_09_6,"Are you sure ""love"" isn't too strong?"
d_counseling_noise_09_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_noise_09_8,I love you guys! Everyone can have a piece of me!
d_counseling_noise_09_9,"Um... yeah, that's good..."
d_counseling_noise_09_10,It's a little awkward. I'll think of something else.
d_counseling_noise_09_11,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_noise_09_12,What do you think the fans would like to get?
d_counseling_noise_09_13,"How about some of my merch? They'd probably enjoy that, right?"
d_counseling_noise_09_14,Noise and I discussed how she could better appreciate her fans.
d_counseling_noise_10_1,Doesn't being a part-time producer weigh down on you? You already have your hands full being a Commander.
d_counseling_noise_10_2,You can take a rest if you need to. Don't worry about me.
d_counseling_noise_10_3,"I'm totally fine, really."
d_counseling_noise_10_4,"I'm a little tired, but it's okay."
d_counseling_noise_10_5,You don't look fine to me...
d_counseling_noise_10_6,You can be honest with me if you're tired.
d_counseling_noise_10_7,You don't need to push yourself.
d_counseling_noise_10_8,I see.
d_counseling_noise_10_9,I appreciate you being honest with me.
d_counseling_noise_10_10,I'll do my best to make it all worth your while.
d_counseling_noise_10_11,Noise and I had a heartfelt conversation.
d_counseling_noise_11_1,How would you feel about someone admitting their feelings
d_counseling_noise_11_2,for you during a concert?
d_counseling_noise_11_3,I'd feel happy.
d_counseling_noise_11_4,I'd feel awkward.
d_counseling_noise_11_5,"Yeah, if two people really like each other,"
d_counseling_noise_11_6,it shouldn't matter when or how you announce it.
d_counseling_noise_11_7,So... at the concert next month...
d_counseling_noise_11_8,I guess you're right.
d_counseling_noise_11_9,It should be on an occasion when both sides are ready.
d_counseling_noise_11_10,... I guess the concert next month isn't the proper time.
d_counseling_noise_11_11,Noise and I discuss different ways to tell someone that you like them.
d_counseling_noise_12_1,"I appreciate that people are interested in me,"
d_counseling_noise_12_2,but I often have people recording me without asking permission.
d_counseling_noise_12_3,What am I supposed to do in that kind of situation?
d_counseling_noise_12_4,Chew them out.
d_counseling_noise_12_5,Make a funny face.
d_counseling_noise_12_6,"... You know I'm not Volume, right?"
d_counseling_noise_12_7,Volume can do whatever she wants...I envy her sometimes.
d_counseling_noise_12_8,Aha! Are you saying I should deliberately sabotage their photo?
d_counseling_noise_12_9,"All right, I'll start practicing today."
d_counseling_noise_12_10,Can you make a face to me? Show me how to do it.
d_counseling_noise_12_11,Noise and I discussed paparazzi for a while longer.
d_counseling_noise_13_1,I'm practicing my new signature.
d_counseling_noise_13_2,"I've been using this current one for a few years now, so I need to switch things up"
d_counseling_noise_13_3,"These are the top contenders, could you take a look?"
d_counseling_noise_13_4,What if people can't recognize your new signature?
d_counseling_noise_13_5,Let me see.
d_counseling_noise_13_6,"Hmm, that's a good point."
d_counseling_noise_13_7,It'd be unfair to anyone who's gotten an autograph from me in the past.
d_counseling_noise_13_8,"All right, I'll go with something a bit more streamlined and recognizable instead."
d_counseling_noise_13_9,I've prepared five different examples.
d_counseling_noise_13_10,"This one incorporates some stars, this one has musical notes, this one has a mic..."
d_counseling_noise_13_11,... They all look the same to me.
d_counseling_noise_13_12,You don't have to say anything. It's written on your face.
d_counseling_noise_13_13,Noise and I had a fun time going out to buy some pens for her new signature.
d_counseling_noise_14_1,Someone said one of my songs is a rip-off of theirs!
d_counseling_noise_14_2,"What is this, some kind of cruel joke?"
d_counseling_noise_14_3,I nearly fainted when they told me that.
d_counseling_noise_14_4,You've got to believe in yourself.
d_counseling_noise_14_5,So...who plagiarized who?
d_counseling_noise_14_6,You're right.
d_counseling_noise_14_7,I only acted that way because I was too self-conscious.
d_counseling_noise_14_8,I need to have more faith in myself.
d_counseling_noise_14_9,...
d_counseling_noise_14_10,...
d_counseling_noise_14_11,...
d_counseling_noise_14_12,... Sorry.
d_counseling_noise_14_13,Noise and I discussed the tortuous process of musical creation.
d_counseling_noise_15_1,Um... this is embarrassing to admit...
d_counseling_noise_15_2,but... there seem to be pictures of me circling around the internet.
d_counseling_noise_15_3,... Not entirely wholesome images at that.
d_counseling_noise_15_4,Must be a twisted admirer of yours.
d_counseling_noise_15_5,You need to report them.
d_counseling_noise_15_6,"Yes, perhaps they were just expressing their fondness for me, albeit in a perverse fashion."
d_counseling_noise_15_7,But it still makes me feel uncomfortable.
d_counseling_noise_15_8,I can't let this sort of thing slide.
d_counseling_noise_15_9,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_noise_15_10,"I've considered it from every angle, and this seems to be the best way of handling it."
d_counseling_noise_15_11,Thanks for helping me make up my mind.
d_counseling_noise_15_12,Noise and I talked more about cybercrimes.
d_counseling_noise_16_1,I have a diehard fan who's supported me ever since I was a busker.
d_counseling_noise_16_2,"He's been spending so much money on my limited-edition merchandise, that his financial situation has gotten precarious."
d_counseling_noise_16_3,"I'm happy that someone likes me so much, but I hate to see their life being negatively impacted because of it."
d_counseling_noise_16_4,Make some exclusive merch just for him.
d_counseling_noise_16_5,He could be perfectly happy living like this.
d_counseling_noise_16_6,"Wow, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_noise_16_7,"If he and I took a photo together, that'd be the ultimate piece of memorabilia for him."
d_counseling_noise_16_8,I'm putting it in my schedule now.
d_counseling_noise_16_9,"I don't know about you,"
d_counseling_noise_16_10,"but to me, nothing about that is normal. Taking care of yourself should take priority above anything else."
d_counseling_noise_16_11,Sacrificing or compromising your own life so that you can follow someone else's is no way to live.
d_counseling_noise_16_12,Noise shared more memorable fan interactions with me.
d_counseling_noise_17_1,"Someone knocked off one of my songs, and they're actually making money off of it!"
d_counseling_noise_17_2,They had the nerve to say it was one of my unpublished B-sides.
d_counseling_noise_17_3,"I don't want to say it was someone working for me, but..."
d_counseling_noise_17_4,How is that possible?
d_counseling_noise_17_5,"It's unfortunate, but I think you're right."
d_counseling_noise_17_6,"I hate to suspect my staff, but it's the only logical explanation."
d_counseling_noise_17_7,"In this line of work, these kinds of unfortunate situations are inevitable."
d_counseling_noise_17_8,It just breaks my heart.
d_counseling_noise_17_9,It's hard to let it go.
d_counseling_noise_17_10,Being betrayed by someone you know
d_counseling_noise_17_11,is something you never get used to.
d_counseling_noise_17_12,"For a long time, Noise and I quietly looked up at the sky."
d_counseling_noise_18_1,Someone told me I should try out a sexy look for once.
d_counseling_noise_18_2,"It's not that I lack confidence or anything, I just don't want people gossiping about me."
d_counseling_noise_18_3,"What do you think, Producer?"
d_counseling_noise_18_4,Are you not sexy already?
d_counseling_noise_18_5,I don't think it suits you.
d_counseling_noise_18_6,...
d_counseling_noise_18_7,... I swear...
d_counseling_noise_18_8,You don't have to say it like that!
d_counseling_noise_18_9,...
d_counseling_noise_18_10,You're right. I'm just a frumpy singer-songwriter.
d_counseling_noise_18_11,That's not what I meant...
d_counseling_noise_18_12,We're done here.
d_counseling_noise_18_13,Noise and I discussed different looks for singers.
d_counseling_noise_19_1,I got an offer from this reality show. They follow you around recording your daily life with next to no editing.
d_counseling_noise_19_2,I'll be able to show the audience the real me.
d_counseling_noise_19_3,But I'm still a little hesitant.
d_counseling_noise_19_4,Only do it if you're willing to be completely open and honest.
d_counseling_noise_19_5,A little mystery can be a good thing.
d_counseling_noise_19_6,In that case... I won't do it.
d_counseling_noise_19_7,Not everything should be made public.
d_counseling_noise_19_8,... Such as group photos with others and so on.
d_counseling_noise_19_9,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_noise_19_10,I'm an entertainer first and foremost.
d_counseling_noise_19_11,It's good if I maintain a slight mystique.
d_counseling_noise_19_12,I'd better not go.
d_counseling_noise_19_13,Noise and I discussed popular shows for a while.
d_counseling_noise_20_1,"If you ask me, I think you're ready for your own debut, Producer."
d_counseling_noise_20_2,"You've easy on the eyes, and you're in good shape. You're a little reserved, but that can have its own charm too."
d_counseling_noise_20_3,I'm sure you'd have plenty of fans.
d_counseling_noise_20_4,I have more important things to do.
d_counseling_noise_20_5,"I'd end up offending many people, racking up scandals."
d_counseling_noise_20_6,?
d_counseling_noise_20_7,"Oh, right."
d_counseling_noise_20_8,I almost forgot that you're a commander as well.
d_counseling_noise_20_9,...
d_counseling_noise_20_10,Don't you dare.
d_counseling_noise_20_11,Noise told me stories about when she made her debut.
d_counseling_volume_01_1,I can hear music blaring from inside the room.
d_counseling_volume_01_2,"Hey,"
d_counseling_volume_01_3,should I turn it up or down?
d_counseling_volume_01_4,Up.
d_counseling_volume_01_5,Down.
d_counseling_volume_01_6,I knew you'd say that!
d_counseling_volume_01_7,Let's crank this baby to 11.
d_counseling_volume_01_8,MAKE SOME NOISE!!!
d_counseling_volume_01_9,"Wait, you want to turn it down?"
d_counseling_volume_01_10,Tha...that's sacrilege!
d_counseling_volume_01_11,What's gotten into you?
d_counseling_volume_01_12,Volume and I listened to some music at full blast for a while.
d_counseling_volume_02_1,"Manager,"
d_counseling_volume_02_2,Do You Love Me?
d_counseling_volume_02_3,Yes.
d_counseling_volume_02_4,Is this the title of your new song?
d_counseling_volume_02_5,"Whoa, you do?"
d_counseling_volume_02_6,"I appreciate that, but I'm afraid it's just the title of my new song."
d_counseling_volume_02_7,"Try and keep those hormones in check, all right?"
d_counseling_volume_02_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_volume_02_9,"You're not one of my staff, so I thought you wouldn't know."
d_counseling_volume_02_10,"Well, since you guessed correctly, you can be the first to hear it."
d_counseling_volume_02_11,I listened to Volume's new song.
d_counseling_volume_03_1,Sometimes I feel like the Ark is a kind of gilded cage.
d_counseling_volume_03_2,Freedom is a foreign concept here.
d_counseling_volume_03_3,"When I look up, all I see is a ceiling instead of the actual sky."
d_counseling_volume_03_4,Let's drill a hole through it!
d_counseling_volume_03_5,Let's use music to blast a hole through it!
d_counseling_volume_03_6,Have you lost your mind?!
d_counseling_volume_03_7,A drill? That's absurd.
d_counseling_volume_03_8,"If the Curtain falls, that's a wrap for every last one of us."
d_counseling_volume_03_9,"All right, that's enough daydreaming for now."
d_counseling_volume_03_10,Although... that does sound kinda fun.
d_counseling_volume_03_11,Should we give it a go?
d_counseling_volume_03_12,Volume and I discuss how to feel freer inside the Ark.
d_counseling_volume_04_1,"I'm about to leave for the show, can you bring me some food?"
d_counseling_volume_04_2,I'm famished.
d_counseling_volume_04_3,Bring her some Splendamin.
d_counseling_volume_04_4,Bring her some water.
d_counseling_volume_04_5,"No, no, no! I never eat Splendamin before a show."
d_counseling_volume_04_6,Fetch me some water.
d_counseling_volume_04_7,You expect water to fill me up?
d_counseling_volume_04_8,"Actually, it's pretty much the perfect choice."
d_counseling_volume_04_9,It's good to wet my whistle before going on stage.
d_counseling_volume_04_10,I got Volume some more water.
d_counseling_volume_05_1,I don't remember who said it.
d_counseling_volume_05_2,But there's a saying that stars should always be ready to be photographed.
d_counseling_volume_05_3,"If you went through life like that, you'd constantly be on pins and needles."
d_counseling_volume_05_4,You mean you have to be ready at all times?
d_counseling_volume_05_5,"Don't get me wrong, of course it makes me nervous."
d_counseling_volume_05_6,But the public doesn't want to see that side of me.
d_counseling_volume_05_7,So I need to put on a brave face and give the people what they want.
d_counseling_volume_05_8,Precisely.
d_counseling_volume_05_9,"24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
d_counseling_volume_05_10,I know a thing or two about being photographed.
d_counseling_volume_05_11,Volume told me some stories about the paparazzi.
d_counseling_volume_06_1,I have a sore throat today.
d_counseling_volume_06_2,"My body is in bad shape, too."
d_counseling_volume_06_3,Why don't you take the day off?
d_counseling_volume_06_4,Your voice does seem out of tune today.
d_counseling_volume_06_5,"Aw, are you looking after me? How considerate of you."
d_counseling_volume_06_6,"Okay, I'll take a day off. It's not good to be fatigued all the time."
d_counseling_volume_06_7,... What?
d_counseling_volume_06_8,You've got some nerve saying that to me!
d_counseling_volume_06_9,Volume and I have a heated discussion.
d_counseling_volume_07_1,Manager?
d_counseling_volume_07_2,I'm not in the mood to talk. Please leave.
d_counseling_volume_07_3,Play some peaceful music.
d_counseling_volume_07_4,Ask her if she wants anything.
d_counseling_volume_07_5,"Hey, is this the new song from VV7?"
d_counseling_volume_07_6,She's got good vocal control.
d_counseling_volume_07_7,"Nothing compared to mine, of course."
d_counseling_volume_07_8,Do you have to ask?
d_counseling_volume_07_9,Just do whatever a manager is supposed to do.
d_counseling_volume_07_10,"If you don't have anything to do, play some music."
d_counseling_volume_07_11,I listened to some music with Volume for a while.
d_counseling_volume_08_1,"If I ever held a concert up on the surface,"
d_counseling_volume_08_2,what do you think it would be like?
d_counseling_volume_08_3,A hot and heavy hip-hop blowout with fun under the sun.
d_counseling_volume_08_4,A raging hip-hop party under the heavy rain.
d_counseling_volume_08_5,"Hmm, doesn't seem very different from the concerts I'm doing now."
d_counseling_volume_08_6,Booooring!
d_counseling_volume_08_7,Can't you come up with something original?
d_counseling_volume_08_8,Yes! That's it!
d_counseling_volume_08_9,Throw a real rager up on the surface during a downpour and get turnt.
d_counseling_volume_08_10,I'm getting pumped just thinking about it.
d_counseling_volume_08_11,Volume and I speculate what a concert up on the surface would look like.
d_counseling_volume_09_1,"You've been working hard, Manager."
d_counseling_volume_09_2,"Is there anything you want? Name it, and it's yours."
d_counseling_volume_09_3,A Romdady S supercar.
d_counseling_volume_09_4,Buy me dinner sometime.
d_counseling_volume_09_5,"Wow, I didn't have you pegged for a speed freak."
d_counseling_volume_09_6,Is that all?
d_counseling_volume_09_7,Money's no object.
d_counseling_volume_09_8,Just dinner? That's so boring.
d_counseling_volume_09_9,How about we buy a car and take it for a spin?
d_counseling_volume_09_10,Volume and I had a nice conversation.
d_counseling_volume_10_1,I have a question for you.
d_counseling_volume_10_2,"Between Noise and I, who do you think is stronger?"
d_counseling_volume_10_3,"Aria and I are radically different in style, so she's out of the equation."
d_counseling_volume_10_4,"You, of course."
d_counseling_volume_10_5,Noise.
d_counseling_volume_10_6,"I knew it. It's a pointless question, isn't it?"
d_counseling_volume_10_7,"Noise is good, but I'm better."
d_counseling_volume_10_8,*Boom*
d_counseling_volume_10_9,Volume smashes the table with her fist.
d_counseling_volume_10_10,"Say that again, I dare you!"
d_counseling_volume_10_11,Don't forget whose manager you are!
d_counseling_volume_10_12,Volume and I had a nice conversation.
d_counseling_volume_11_1,My new song needs a guest star.
d_counseling_volume_11_2,Do you have anyone in mind?
d_counseling_volume_11_3,I could do it.
d_counseling_volume_11_4,I'll find someone.
d_counseling_volume_11_5,Huh? You? You can sing?
d_counseling_volume_11_6,You must be pretty confident.
d_counseling_volume_11_7,"All right, let's hear it."
d_counseling_volume_11_8,"All right, hopefully you can turn someone up."
d_counseling_volume_11_9,I'd like a husky voice that's not too high or too low.
d_counseling_volume_11_10,"Oh right, and also..."
d_counseling_volume_11_11,Volume and I started searching for suitable candidates.
d_counseling_volume_12_1,What do you think I would be doing if I hadn't become a rapper?
d_counseling_volume_12_2,I ask myself that question sometimes.
d_counseling_volume_12_3,Probably some menial job at the police station.
d_counseling_volume_12_4,I can't imagine you doing anything but rapping.
d_counseling_volume_12_5,What? The Police Station?
d_counseling_volume_12_6,You think I'd make a decent police officer?
d_counseling_volume_12_7,Or do you mean I'd just be some desk jockey pushing pencils? If that's what you're saying...then you're fired.
d_counseling_volume_12_8,I agree. I can't imagine doing anything else.
d_counseling_volume_12_9,Perhaps I was born to be a rapper.
d_counseling_volume_12_10,Volume and I discussed different career paths for a while.
d_counseling_volume_13_1,What do you think is the most important thing for a rapper to have?
d_counseling_volume_13_2,Superb rapping skills.
d_counseling_volume_13_3,Swag
d_counseling_volume_13_4,"That's important, no doubt."
d_counseling_volume_13_5,"However, there's something that matters even more."
d_counseling_volume_13_6,"Swag. With enough swag, anything can be cool."
d_counseling_volume_13_7,"That's right, swag is paramount."
d_counseling_volume_13_8,"Without it, hip-hop would lose a lot of its flavor."
d_counseling_volume_13_9,You hit the nail on the head.
d_counseling_volume_13_10,Volume and I discuss swag for a while.
d_counseling_volume_14_1,"Yesterday, a staff member accidentally spilled water on me."
d_counseling_volume_14_2,That guy getting the boot.
d_counseling_volume_14_3,It was a one-time thing. Go easy on him.
d_counseling_volume_14_4,Everyone makes mistakes.
d_counseling_volume_14_5,Why should I?
d_counseling_volume_14_6,He shouldn't have spilled the water in the first place!
d_counseling_volume_14_7,"Making mistakes may be a common occurrence for humans,"
d_counseling_volume_14_8,but not for me. I don't make mistakes.
d_counseling_volume_14_9,Volume and I talked more about mistakes.
d_counseling_volume_15_1,Do you prefer
d_counseling_volume_15_2,hip-hop or pop music?
d_counseling_volume_15_3,Hip-hop.
d_counseling_volume_15_4,Pop.
d_counseling_volume_15_5,I see you have a good taste.
d_counseling_volume_15_6,Pop melodies are so obvious.
d_counseling_volume_15_7,"Meanwhile, hip-hop beats pierce your very soul!"
d_counseling_volume_15_8,What? Pop?
d_counseling_volume_15_9,"Maybe you should be Noise's manager, not mine."
d_counseling_volume_15_10,Volume and I talked about our musical preferences.
d_counseling_volume_16_1,"If some dimwit challenges me to a rap battle,"
d_counseling_volume_16_2,what should I do?
d_counseling_volume_16_3,Take 'em to school so they know not to mess with you again.
d_counseling_volume_16_4,Just ignore them.
d_counseling_volume_16_5,"Okay, so you agree with me."
d_counseling_volume_16_6,How dare they challenge me to a rap battle?
d_counseling_volume_16_7,"I'll clown them so hard, that they won't show their face in the hip-hop community again"
d_counseling_volume_16_8,Ignore? There's no such word in my dictionary.
d_counseling_volume_16_9,I'm gonna take them to school.
d_counseling_volume_16_10,Volume and I talked more about rap battles.
d_counseling_volume_17_1,What do you think of people who make their love life public?
d_counseling_volume_17_2,I think it'll be good.
d_counseling_volume_17_3,I think they'll end up regretting the attention they'll get from the public.
d_counseling_volume_17_4,Really? I think loud and proud is the way to go.
d_counseling_volume_17_5,Certainly better than trying to hide from the public eye.
d_counseling_volume_17_6,"Besides, being in a relationship isn't a bad thing."
d_counseling_volume_17_7,I don't think that kind of attention will do any harm.
d_counseling_volume_17_8,Everyone looks at me no matter where I go anyway.
d_counseling_volume_17_9,I think it's exciting!
d_counseling_volume_17_10,Volume and I discussed the pros and cons of celebrity dating.
d_counseling_volume_18_1,I am planning to make a custom mic. Which color should I pick?
d_counseling_volume_18_2,Yellow.
d_counseling_volume_18_3,Black.
d_counseling_volume_18_4,You don't think yellow is too childish?
d_counseling_volume_18_5,"Also, it's way too bright. No, no way."
d_counseling_volume_18_6,Black? Okay.
d_counseling_volume_18_7,That suits my temperament.
d_counseling_volume_18_8,Volume and I talked more about custom mics.
d_counseling_volume_19_1,There's something I've always wondered about Aria.
d_counseling_volume_19_2,"Her operas are so crushingly dull, how can she play them so well without being bored to tears?"
d_counseling_volume_19_3,Everyone has their own specialties.
d_counseling_volume_19_4,I think you could pull it off as well.
d_counseling_volume_19_5,I guess you're right.
d_counseling_volume_19_6,But you couldn't pay me enough to sing that stuff.
d_counseling_volume_19_7,Huh? Are you being serious?
d_counseling_volume_19_8,Makes me bored just thinking about it.
d_counseling_volume_19_9,"Then again, maybe I could do it if I really put my mind to it. Still seems a little farfetched to me."
d_counseling_volume_19_10,Volume and I talk more about opera.
d_counseling_volume_20_1,I want to switch things up with my schedule.
d_counseling_volume_20_2,What would you recommend?
d_counseling_volume_20_3,Film some ads.
d_counseling_volume_20_4,Go on a TV show.
d_counseling_volume_20_5,Ads? That could be interesting.
d_counseling_volume_20_6,I'm sure anything I endorsed would sell out almost instantly.
d_counseling_volume_20_7,"Okay, arrange an ad shoot for me in the schedule."
d_counseling_volume_20_8,You can't be serious.
d_counseling_volume_20_9,What else?
d_counseling_volume_20_10,Volume and I discuss her schedule for a while.
d_counseling_aria_01_1,"When you're booking tickets for a theater,"
d_counseling_aria_01_2,which seats do you prefer?
d_counseling_aria_01_3,The ones closest to the stage.
d_counseling_aria_01_4,Anywhere is fine.
d_counseling_aria_01_5,I thought you'd say that.
d_counseling_aria_01_6,"That's good, because"
d_counseling_aria_01_7,I asked for some VIP tickets in advance.
d_counseling_aria_01_8,You can use them the next time you come to see the show.
d_counseling_aria_01_9,So you don't care one way or the other...
d_counseling_aria_01_10,I was thinking about getting you some VIP tickets if you wanted to sit close to the stage.
d_counseling_aria_01_11,But I guess that won't be necessary...
d_counseling_aria_01_12,Aria and I talked more about her performances.
d_counseling_aria_02_1,One of the theater employees told me now is the best time to take a vacation.
d_counseling_aria_02_2,"If you had some time off, what would you do?"
d_counseling_aria_02_3,Stay at home and sleep in.
d_counseling_aria_02_4,Travel far away to somewhere exotic.
d_counseling_aria_02_5,Wait.
d_counseling_aria_02_6,You can do that any day.
d_counseling_aria_02_7,You don't need vacation time for that.
d_counseling_aria_02_8,I don't get it...
d_counseling_aria_02_9,Going off to a distant place...
d_counseling_aria_02_10,That would be nice.
d_counseling_aria_02_11,I'm sure there'd be all sorts of exotic scenery and music to take in.
d_counseling_aria_02_12,Aria and I discussed our hypothetical vacation plans.
d_counseling_aria_03_1,"If you have to choose between wealth and fame,"
d_counseling_aria_03_2,which one will you pick?
d_counseling_aria_03_3,Fame.
d_counseling_aria_03_4,I don't need either of them.
d_counseling_aria_03_5,"Oh, really? It seems that fame is of great importance to you."
d_counseling_aria_03_6,I didn't think fame would mean much to you since you are always seen talking to numerous Nikkes.
d_counseling_aria_03_7,So I admit I'm a little surprised.
d_counseling_aria_03_8,I knew you'd say that.
d_counseling_aria_03_9,"Just like you, music holds more importance to me than them both."
d_counseling_aria_03_10,I'm sure there's something you value more than fame and wealth.
d_counseling_aria_03_11,Aria and I continue to discuss the most important things in our lives.
d_counseling_aria_04_1,"I was walking to a station at the Outpost,"
d_counseling_aria_04_2,when I heard this awful singing.
d_counseling_aria_04_3,Did something happen there?
d_counseling_aria_04_4,It's home to a tone-deaf ghost.
d_counseling_aria_04_5,It's home to a poor soul who has forgotten how to sing.
d_counseling_aria_04_6,"Maestro, you know as well as I do"
d_counseling_aria_04_7,that ghosts aren't real.
d_counseling_aria_04_8,That's so sad!
d_counseling_aria_04_9,"Although their singing truly was awful, I feel so bad for them."
d_counseling_aria_04_10,Can you invite them to my next show?
d_counseling_aria_04_11,Aria and I talked more about how to cure tone-deafness.
d_counseling_aria_05_1,Do you think the beginning
d_counseling_aria_05_2,or the ending of a song is more important?
d_counseling_aria_05_3,The beginning.
d_counseling_aria_05_4,The end.
d_counseling_aria_05_5,I agree.
d_counseling_aria_05_6,"If I can't get into a song right away,"
d_counseling_aria_05_7,the rest of it doesn't come outright.
d_counseling_aria_05_8,"For me, the beginning of a song is when I'm most immersed in it."
d_counseling_aria_05_9,"Yeah... The end is important, too."
d_counseling_aria_05_10,But I care more about the beginning.
d_counseling_aria_05_11,"If I can't get into a song right away,"
d_counseling_aria_05_12,the rest of it doesn't come outright.
d_counseling_aria_05_13,Aria gives me some pointers on how to immerse yourself in the music when singing.
d_counseling_aria_06_1,"Maestro,"
d_counseling_aria_06_2,"if we ever reclaim the surface, what's the first thing you'll do?"
d_counseling_aria_06_3,Find higher ground and shout to the heavens that we have retaken the surface.
d_counseling_aria_06_4,Find higher ground and sing.
d_counseling_aria_06_5,You paint quite the pretty picture.
d_counseling_aria_06_6,I can feel how much it means to you.
d_counseling_aria_06_7,I wonder what your voice would sound like expressing such joy.
d_counseling_aria_06_8,"If I ever have the chance, I'd love to hear it."
d_counseling_aria_06_9,You? Sing?
d_counseling_aria_06_10,You don't need to say that to make me happy.
d_counseling_aria_06_11,"When the time comes, you can leave the singing to me."
d_counseling_aria_06_12,You can be free to celebrate any way you like.
d_counseling_aria_06_13,Aria and I imagined various scenarios of us reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_aria_07_1,Volume's music really packs a punch.
d_counseling_aria_07_2,I think adding some tougher lyrics would give it even more of an impact.
d_counseling_aria_07_3,"Maestro, are you a fan of hard-hitting music?"
d_counseling_aria_07_4,I am. It helps me identify with Volume.
d_counseling_aria_07_5,I can't really identify with the emotions being expressed in that kind of music.
d_counseling_aria_07_6,The most important thing is that our music expresses our true selves.
d_counseling_aria_07_7,It's not about the styles of the music.
d_counseling_aria_07_8,I see that you understand that perfectly.
d_counseling_aria_07_9,I thought you had an eclectic taste in music.
d_counseling_aria_07_10,But I can see how those emotions could be unfamiliar to some people.
d_counseling_aria_07_11,I suppose that's why they call it a preference.
d_counseling_aria_07_12,Aria and I continued listening to Volume's music.
d_counseling_aria_08_1,"Among us musicians, Noise has the closest ties with the masses."
d_counseling_aria_08_2,"Actually, she cares what the public thinks so much, that it can sometimes cause her to get into a funk."
d_counseling_aria_08_3,"If she was feeling down when you saw her, what would you do?"
d_counseling_aria_08_4,I'd try to cheer her up.
d_counseling_aria_08_5,I wouldn't do anything. It's the path she chose.
d_counseling_aria_08_6,... Really?
d_counseling_aria_08_7,"If it were me, I wouldn't do anything."
d_counseling_aria_08_8,This is the path she chose.
d_counseling_aria_08_9,She's aware of the downsides.
d_counseling_aria_08_10,Good answer.
d_counseling_aria_08_11,This is the path that she chose. She has to take the good with the bad.
d_counseling_aria_08_12,"Besides, Noise won't give up just because she's down in the dumps."
d_counseling_aria_08_13,She'll weather the storm. I'm sure of it.
d_counseling_aria_08_14,Aria and I continued listening to Noise's music.
d_counseling_aria_09_1,What a nice day!
d_counseling_aria_09_2,I want to do something exciting. Something spontaneous.
d_counseling_aria_09_3,How about you take a break from practice?
d_counseling_aria_09_4,Try to practice singing outdoors.
d_counseling_aria_09_5,"Oh no, I can't do that!"
d_counseling_aria_09_6,I'm afraid that's not an option.
d_counseling_aria_09_7,"That... could be fun, I guess."
d_counseling_aria_09_8,"It'd be a nice change of pace, and it could help me get more out of my practice."
d_counseling_aria_09_9,I went outdoors with Aria.
d_counseling_aria_10_1,I run through the gamut of emotions while on stage.
d_counseling_aria_10_2,But the strongest of them is still loneliness.
d_counseling_aria_10_3,"The unfolding stories, the expectation of the audience, and the arrangement made with everyone. All of this is up on me."
d_counseling_aria_10_4,"You'll always have your music, Aria."
d_counseling_aria_10_5,"You'll always have me, Aria."
d_counseling_aria_10_6,... That's right.
d_counseling_aria_10_7,Music can help me forget my loneliness.
d_counseling_aria_10_8,"So actually, I'm not alone at all."
d_counseling_aria_10_9,But you're not on stage with me.
d_counseling_aria_10_10,"Perhaps we could perform together one day, but the chances of that are slim to none."
d_counseling_aria_10_11,Are you even listening to what I'm saying?
d_counseling_aria_10_12,Aria shares with me the feelings she experiences while on stage.
d_counseling_aria_11_1,Opera is a genre of great antiquity.
d_counseling_aria_11_2,Songs conducted centuries ago are still being sung today.
d_counseling_aria_11_3,What do you think its secret is?
d_counseling_aria_11_4,What was once old always becomes new again.
d_counseling_aria_11_5,Opera is eternal.
d_counseling_aria_11_6,...
d_counseling_aria_11_7,Actually... I was thinking just the opposite.
d_counseling_aria_11_8,Opera has never changed to fit with any trend. It's always stood alone.
d_counseling_aria_11_9,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_aria_11_10,Not everything changes with the passage of time.
d_counseling_aria_11_11,"Beautiful melodies, love, and so on..."
d_counseling_aria_11_12,Aria and I continued talking about opera.
d_counseling_aria_12_1,I had a debate with my director not long ago.
d_counseling_aria_12_2,He and I have a difference of opinion regarding my music.
d_counseling_aria_12_3,"If it were you, what would you do?"
d_counseling_aria_12_4,I'd give in to the director.
d_counseling_aria_12_5,I'd try to convince him that I was right.
d_counseling_aria_12_6,"Yes, that would certainly resolve the argument."
d_counseling_aria_12_7,"After all, there's no such thing as a perfect performance."
d_counseling_aria_12_8,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_aria_12_9,It's okay for the director to have his own opinion.
d_counseling_aria_12_10,"If he can't convince me, however, I'm convinced that my performance will suffer."
d_counseling_aria_12_11,Aria and I thought about ways to resolve this disagreement within the troupe.
d_counseling_aria_13_1,Love is an indispensable topic in opera.
d_counseling_aria_13_2,"But as you know, romantic scenes are not my strong suit."
d_counseling_aria_13_3,Someone even said once that I didn't look human during an emotional scene.
d_counseling_aria_13_4,What can I do to improve?
d_counseling_aria_13_5,Try to open your heart to someone.
d_counseling_aria_13_6,Just focus on the music.
d_counseling_aria_13_7,Well...
d_counseling_aria_13_8,"Even if I was in a relationship with someone,"
d_counseling_aria_13_9,I'm sure it wouldn't live up to everyone's expectations.
d_counseling_aria_13_10,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_aria_13_11,I can use music to evoke emotions within me.
d_counseling_aria_13_12,I'll try that next time. Thank you!
d_counseling_aria_13_13,Aria and I discuss how love can be expressed.
d_counseling_aria_14_1,There's a tenor who was practicing a duet with me.
d_counseling_aria_14_2,He kept fumbling his lines.
d_counseling_aria_14_3,"And because he was so hard on himself, he only ended up making more mistakes..."
d_counseling_aria_14_4,What should I do to help him?
d_counseling_aria_14_5,Let him handle it on his own.
d_counseling_aria_14_6,How about you make flub some notes to make him feel less awkward?
d_counseling_aria_14_7,I think that's about the only thing I can do.
d_counseling_aria_14_8,"Besides, I am not comfortable dealing with other people's feelings."
d_counseling_aria_14_9,No. I never make mistakes.
d_counseling_aria_14_10,I'm incapable of it.
d_counseling_aria_14_11,Aria and I continued thinking up different ways to help other people.
d_counseling_aria_15_1,Do you prefer
d_counseling_aria_15_2,comedies or tragedies?
d_counseling_aria_15_3,Comedy.
d_counseling_aria_15_4,Tragedy.
d_counseling_aria_15_5,"I like comedy more, as well."
d_counseling_aria_15_6,"However, my favorite opera is not a comedy."
d_counseling_aria_15_7,Every writer has their magnum opus.
d_counseling_aria_15_8,"In my opinion, most of those tend to be tragedies."
d_counseling_aria_15_9,"If the writing is up to par, tragic stories appeal to me more"
d_counseling_aria_15_10,Aria and I discussed what kind of operas we prefer.
d_counseling_aria_16_1,Protagonists in opera series tend to end up at their final destinations.
d_counseling_aria_16_2,Their death is what completes the show.
d_counseling_aria_16_3,Have you ever considered what the perfect death would be?
d_counseling_aria_16_4,Sacrificing yourself for a noble cause.
d_counseling_aria_16_5,"There's no such thing as a ""perfect death""."
d_counseling_aria_16_6,... I agree.
d_counseling_aria_16_7,"If a protagonist is willing to give their lives to protect something,"
d_counseling_aria_16_8,"they must have found a greater purpose in life, something more valuable than their own life."
d_counseling_aria_16_9,Dying a heroic death is more admirable than living in shame.
d_counseling_aria_16_10,...
d_counseling_aria_16_11,"Are you saying that death is meaningless, no matter what?"
d_counseling_aria_16_12,"You're not exactly a romantic, I'll say that much."
d_counseling_aria_16_13,I discussed philosophy with Aria for a while.
d_counseling_aria_17_1,"Maestro, you're constantly surrounded by women."
d_counseling_aria_17_2,Are any of them your type?
d_counseling_aria_17_3,"You are, Aria."
d_counseling_aria_17_4,I don't know.
d_counseling_aria_17_5,I would be honored
d_counseling_aria_17_6,to be your muse.
d_counseling_aria_17_7,"You're so indecisive, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_counseling_aria_17_8,"Men and women who excel in the realm of seduction are said to be very charming,"
d_counseling_aria_17_9,"but when it's all said and done, all they end up with are regrets"
d_counseling_aria_17_10,Aria and I continued to discuss similarly profound topics.
d_counseling_aria_18_1,Sometimes I feel like taking a sabbatical from opera.
d_counseling_aria_18_2,What are some recreational activities I could have fun with?
d_counseling_aria_18_3,Rock climbing.
d_counseling_aria_18_4,Go sing some karaoke.
d_counseling_aria_18_5,An opera singer that likes rock climbing.
d_counseling_aria_18_6,I'd become a laughingstock if the media caught wind of it.
d_counseling_aria_18_7,... Hmm.
d_counseling_aria_18_8,It would be nice to sing something that's not my typical style.
d_counseling_aria_18_9,"All right, let's go sing some karaoke!"
d_counseling_aria_18_10,I recommended even more activities to Aria.
d_counseling_aria_19_1,"Maestro, have you ever hit a snag before?"
d_counseling_aria_19_2,"Of course, it's common."
d_counseling_aria_19_3,I don't think I have.
d_counseling_aria_19_4,Hitting a bottleneck prevents you from progressing any further.
d_counseling_aria_19_5,"However, once you manage to get past them, you're better off for it."
d_counseling_aria_19_6,"When you think about it, they're actually a great learning opportunity."
d_counseling_aria_19_7,... Really?
d_counseling_aria_19_8,Maybe it's because you always try to avoid them.
d_counseling_aria_19_9,"By going around them though, you may be missing a chance to become better at what you do."
d_counseling_aria_19_10,Aria and I discussed different methods of self-improvement.
d_counseling_aria_20_1,"Let's say you're an opera composer,"
d_counseling_aria_20_2,and your tastes are directly opposed to what the public wants to see.
d_counseling_aria_20_3,"In the end, who would you compose for?"
d_counseling_aria_20_4,For myself.
d_counseling_aria_20_5,For the public.
d_counseling_aria_20_6,... I agree.
d_counseling_aria_20_7,"If you work at it hard enough, you'll eventually reach the top of your respective field."
d_counseling_aria_20_8,"The question is, when you reach the top, did you get there by being true to yourself or by appealing to the masses?"
d_counseling_aria_20_9,... That's an old-fashioned answer.
d_counseling_aria_20_10,That's a treacherous path as well.
d_counseling_aria_20_11,Even the most talented of artists struggle trying to capture what audiences want.
d_counseling_aria_20_12,I continued to discuss the arduous life of an artist with Aria.
d_counseling_helm_01_1,"When you're out on the battlefield,"
d_counseling_helm_01_2,"which do you think is more important, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_01_3,Tried-and-true tactics or improvisation?
d_counseling_helm_01_4,Tried-and-true tactics.
d_counseling_helm_01_5,Improvisation.
d_counseling_helm_01_6,That's one thing you and I agree on.
d_counseling_helm_01_7,I think it's vital to stick to the techniques that have been practiced beforehand.
d_counseling_helm_01_8,Only then will the ship not veer too far off course.
d_counseling_helm_01_9,I'm the opposite.
d_counseling_helm_01_10,I put all my faith in tactics that have already proven effective in the past.
d_counseling_helm_01_11,"Sure, improvising may be better for handling unexpected events, but..."
d_counseling_helm_01_12,flying by the seat of your pants may bring about some dire consequences down the line.
d_counseling_helm_01_13,Helm and I talk more in-depth about various ways of commanding on a battlefield.
d_counseling_helm_02_1,"Do you like seafood-flavored Splendamin, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_02_2,"Octopus-flavored Splendamin. Halibut-flavored Splendamin. 
Things like that..."
d_counseling_helm_02_3,I like it.
d_counseling_helm_02_4,Not really.
d_counseling_helm_02_5,!!
d_counseling_helm_02_6,"You like it too, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_02_7,That's an outrage! Everyone around me seems to be crazy about that fishy and salty... Blech! They must think I'm weird for hating it.
d_counseling_helm_02_8,"If you ask me, they're the ones who are weird."
d_counseling_helm_02_9,Whew... That's a relief.
d_counseling_helm_02_10,"If you ended up liking that nasty stuff,"
d_counseling_helm_02_11,I'd be the only one who isn't obsessing over it.
d_counseling_helm_02_12,It would have been horrible.
d_counseling_helm_02_13,Helm continues to list the various reasons why she detests seafood-flavored Splendamin.
d_counseling_helm_03_1,"Which flavor do you prefer most? Spicy, salty or sour?"
d_counseling_helm_03_2,"Just so you know, I'm not a massive fan of any of them."
d_counseling_helm_03_3,Spicy.
d_counseling_helm_03_4,Salty.
d_counseling_helm_03_5,"Yeah, I'm the same as well. At the very least, it gives an umami flavor to it, which is nice."
d_counseling_helm_03_6,"Every time I eat something salty, it just feels like it's sticking to my tongue."
d_counseling_helm_03_7,"No matter how much water I drink afterward, that feeling doesn't go away. I simply detest it."
d_counseling_helm_03_8,You really think so?
d_counseling_helm_03_9,I can't say I agree.
d_counseling_helm_03_10,I just can't stand salty stuff. It always feels like it's sticking to my tongue.
d_counseling_helm_03_11,"No matter how much water I drink afterward, that feeling doesn't go away. I simply detest it."
d_counseling_helm_03_12,Helm and I continue to talk more about the flavors we prefer.
d_counseling_helm_04_1,"Subordinate, do you think..."
d_counseling_helm_04_2,the surface will be reclaimed one day?
d_counseling_helm_04_3,"Yes, I believe it will happen."
d_counseling_helm_04_4,... I'm not sure.
d_counseling_helm_04_5,"I, too, believe that day will come."
d_counseling_helm_04_6,"And when it does,"
d_counseling_helm_04_7,the Admire will protect every last inch of the ocean on the surface.
d_counseling_helm_04_8,"... Yes, you may be right."
d_counseling_helm_04_9,"But I believe that no matter how hopeless things may appear, you should never give up on your dreams."
d_counseling_helm_04_10,"If you do, then you're just letting your nightmares come true."
d_counseling_helm_04_11,Helm and I have a conversation about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_helm_05_1,"Hypothetically speaking,"
d_counseling_helm_05_2,"IF you were to receive a large sum of money,"
d_counseling_helm_05_3,how do you intend to spend it?
d_counseling_helm_05_4,Did you receive more donations than usual?
d_counseling_helm_05_5,I'll invest in the Admire.
d_counseling_helm_05_6,!!
d_counseling_helm_05_7,How can you...
d_counseling_helm_05_8,"Well, what would you do? I want a serious answer."
d_counseling_helm_05_9,Not exactly the answer I was looking for...
d_counseling_helm_05_10,I was hoping you'd tell me about some dream you would invest it in.
d_counseling_helm_05_11,...
d_counseling_helm_05_12,Still... Thanks for saying that.
d_counseling_helm_05_13,Helm and I cannot help but fantasize about hitting it big.
d_counseling_helm_06_1,Do you know Ludmilla from Unlimited?
d_counseling_helm_06_2,"Not only are we descended from royalty, but I've also received her help once before."
d_counseling_helm_06_3,"It's been ages since I last got in touch with her, so I'd like to give her a gift. So what do you think I should give her?"
d_counseling_helm_06_4,A fancy tea set.
d_counseling_helm_06_5,A fancy handkerchief.
d_counseling_helm_06_6,Hm... That's not a bad idea.
d_counseling_helm_06_7,I think she'd like that.
d_counseling_helm_06_8,"Hm... A bit ordinary, don't you think?"
d_counseling_helm_06_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_helm_06_10,"Oh well... If nothing else comes to mind, then I'll just go with that."
d_counseling_helm_06_11,Can you afford it?
d_counseling_helm_06_12,!!
d_counseling_helm_06_13,... No.
d_counseling_helm_06_14,"I'll just... get her a gift later on, I guess."
d_counseling_helm_06_15,...
d_counseling_helm_06_16,... I purchase the gift and send it to Ludmilla on Helm's behalf.
d_counseling_helm_07_1,Anchor has a bad habit of tossing starfish around whenever she's in a tough spot.
d_counseling_helm_07_2,"I'm trying to get her to kick the habit, but I'm not sure how to go about it."
d_counseling_helm_07_3,I'll toss out all the starfish in Anchor's locker.
d_counseling_helm_07_4,You can try tossing out all the starfish in Anchor's locker.
d_counseling_helm_07_5,!!
d_counseling_helm_07_6,You're gonna throw them all out?
d_counseling_helm_07_7,That's diabolical!
d_counseling_helm_07_8,... Thank you so much.
d_counseling_helm_07_9,Wait... you can't be serious?
d_counseling_helm_07_10,You actually want me to rummage through her locker for those disgusting starfish?
d_counseling_helm_07_11,No way. Ain't gonna happen!
d_counseling_helm_07_12,Helm and I continue to talk about Anchor and her starfish.
d_counseling_helm_08_1,The Admire features the latest cutting-edge technology...
d_counseling_helm_08_2,"designed to provide our distinguished guests with the safest and most peaceful journey possible. In the past, countless ships..."
d_counseling_helm_08_3,"Argh, I can't memorize all this!"
d_counseling_helm_08_4,Would it help if we recite the speech together?
d_counseling_helm_08_5,Would it help if I listened to you reciting the speech?
d_counseling_helm_08_6,"No, it's okay."
d_counseling_helm_08_7,"When the time comes, I'll be the only one reciting it anyway."
d_counseling_helm_08_8,I'll just keep at it.
d_counseling_helm_08_9,"You want to be my audience, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_08_10,... That's a swell idea actually. I'll be able to memorize it more easily if it feels like the actual thing.
d_counseling_helm_08_11,I appreciate it.
d_counseling_helm_08_12,Time flies by as I watch Helm memorize her speech.
d_counseling_helm_09_1,"It is finally time for Helm and me to have a session,"
d_counseling_helm_09_2,but she is nowhere to be found.
d_counseling_helm_09_3,All I could find was a lone glass box left on the floor.
d_counseling_helm_09_4,Place a card containing small amounts of credit in the box.
d_counseling_helm_09_5,Place one of Anchor's starfish in the box.
d_counseling_helm_09_6,*Beep*
d_counseling_helm_09_7,"Sorry, I'm late..."
d_counseling_helm_09_8,Helm sees the glass box.
d_counseling_helm_09_9,!!!
d_counseling_helm_09_10,"... I've only left for a moment, Subordinate. I can't believe you actually placed that in there..."
d_counseling_helm_09_11,"Usually, it's not ethical for me to receive credits,"
d_counseling_helm_09_12,"but for you, I'll make an exception."
d_counseling_helm_09_13,Thanks.
d_counseling_helm_09_14,*Beep*
d_counseling_helm_09_15,"Sorry, I'm late..."
d_counseling_helm_09_16,Helm sees the glass box.
d_counseling_helm_09_17,!!!
d_counseling_helm_09_18,What... is that?
d_counseling_helm_09_19,Subordinate... what exactly did you put in there?!
d_counseling_helm_09_20,Eek! Take that horrendous thing out this instant!
d_counseling_helm_09_21,I talk with Helm about what constitutes a proper donation.
d_counseling_helm_10_1,"By the way, are you good at swimming?"
d_counseling_helm_10_2,"I'm only asking, just in case."
d_counseling_helm_10_3,I'm extremely good at it.
d_counseling_helm_10_4,I sink like a stone.
d_counseling_helm_10_5,That's great.
d_counseling_helm_10_6,I'd be worried if you didn't know how.
d_counseling_helm_10_7,"In that case, let's head to the swimming pool."
d_counseling_helm_10_8,I wanna see what you're made of.
d_counseling_helm_10_9,What?
d_counseling_helm_10_10,How can you not know how to swim when you're with Aegis?!
d_counseling_helm_10_11,That just won't do!
d_counseling_helm_10_12,"From now on, you're undergoing special training."
d_counseling_helm_10_13,Let's go to the swimming pool.
d_counseling_helm_10_14,Helm and I make our way to the swimming pool.
d_counseling_helm_11_1,"Whenever I'm about to give an important speech, my mind will more often than not go blank."
d_counseling_helm_11_2,"It doesn't happen often. Just occasionally, whenever it's a particularly big or significant event."
d_counseling_helm_11_3,"I haven't made any major blunders yet, but I'm worried it'll happen one of these days."
d_counseling_helm_11_4,It's normal to flub a line or two.
d_counseling_helm_11_5,Don't forget who you're representing.
d_counseling_helm_11_6,"For most, one misstep may not be the end of the world."
d_counseling_helm_11_7,"However, it is for us."
d_counseling_helm_11_8,"With how much we're struggling, one mistake may ruin us."
d_counseling_helm_11_9,So I need to hold it together.
d_counseling_helm_11_10,"Thanks. We may have taken a long way around, but it helped."
d_counseling_helm_11_11,...
d_counseling_helm_11_12,You're right.
d_counseling_helm_11_13,My mistakes are not just my own
d_counseling_helm_11_14,since they'll reflect poorly on the entire Aegis.
d_counseling_helm_11_15,Thanks for opening my eyes.
d_counseling_helm_11_16,Helm and I research different breathing techniques for relieving anxiety.
d_counseling_helm_12_1,I want to test your knowledge of emergency procedures today.
d_counseling_helm_12_2,"Let's say I fell into the water. Even after you've pulled me out, I remain unconscious."
d_counseling_helm_12_3,"So the question now is, what is the first thing you should do?"
d_counseling_helm_12_4,There's no way you'd ever fall into the water.
d_counseling_helm_12_5,I'd give you a kiss first.
d_counseling_helm_12_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_helm_12_7,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_helm_12_8,"It's not an answer I was expecting to hear, but I'll accept it."
d_counseling_helm_12_9,... Subordinate.
d_counseling_helm_12_10,"It's not a kiss, but CPR."
d_counseling_helm_12_11,And that's not the first thing you should do.
d_counseling_helm_12_12,Honestly...
d_counseling_helm_12_13,"With that, Helm begins to give me first-aid training."
d_counseling_helm_13_1,The Admire is always so filthy.
d_counseling_helm_13_2,All this dirt and grime that builds up every day.
d_counseling_helm_13_3,"Don't ask me why, but all it ever does is float in a swimming pool."
d_counseling_helm_13_4,"Perhaps, that's the reason?"
d_counseling_helm_13_5,"I mean, people become dirty too if they don't clean themselves up."
d_counseling_helm_13_6,You've got a point...
d_counseling_helm_13_7,"If it could sail the ocean, I'm sure it'd help with the cleanliness problem."
d_counseling_helm_13_8,It's a shame that it's not possible right now.
d_counseling_helm_13_9,!!
d_counseling_helm_13_10,Good point.
d_counseling_helm_13_11,"After all, the Admire is no ordinary ship."
d_counseling_helm_13_12,It's also a member of Aegis.
d_counseling_helm_13_13,Helm and I begin to talk about how to clean the swimming pool.
d_counseling_helm_14_1,Su-Subordinate...
d_counseling_helm_14_2,"Jeez, Anchor threw... this right in my face."
d_counseling_helm_14_3,"It's not a st-starfish, is it?"
d_counseling_helm_14_4,"That's a living, breathing starfish, all right."
d_counseling_helm_14_5,Calm down. It's only a toy.
d_counseling_helm_14_6,!!
d_counseling_helm_14_7,!!!!
d_counseling_helm_14_8,Th-thank you for telling me the truth.
d_counseling_helm_14_9,"Can you do me a favor, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_14_10,Take. This. Thing. Off. Of. Me!
d_counseling_helm_14_11,A-are you sure?
d_counseling_helm_14_12,*Wiggle*
d_counseling_helm_14_13,!!!!
d_counseling_helm_14_14,...!!!!!
d_counseling_helm_14_15,I begin to examine the starfish that is stuck on Helm.
d_counseling_helm_15_1,"Subordinate, do you prefer a lightweight but fast ship"
d_counseling_helm_15_2,or a strong but slow ship?
d_counseling_helm_15_3,A lightweight but fast ship.
d_counseling_helm_15_4,A strong but slow ship.
d_counseling_helm_15_5,Hm... Really?
d_counseling_helm_15_6,"It's rather different from the Admire,"
d_counseling_helm_15_7,but it's a perfectly valid choice.
d_counseling_helm_15_8,I knew you'd say that.
d_counseling_helm_15_9,"That's just how the Admire is. It may not be the fastest ship, but it certainly has a charm to it."
d_counseling_helm_15_10,Yes... Just the way I like it.
d_counseling_helm_15_11,I spend time folding paper boats with Helm.
d_counseling_helm_16_1,Suppose someone decides to sponsor you all of a sudden.
d_counseling_helm_16_2,Say they give you enough money that you can lead the life you want.
d_counseling_helm_16_3,"What will you do, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_16_4,I'd accept it with pleasure.
d_counseling_helm_16_5,It'd be meaningless if I didn't accomplish it myself.
d_counseling_helm_16_6,"Exactly, why turn down a good thing?"
d_counseling_helm_16_7,I can't help thinking...
d_counseling_helm_16_8,"If that's how I end up making it, will any of those achievements be truly mine?"
d_counseling_helm_16_9,"If I didn't accomplish something myself, have I actually done at the end of the day?"
d_counseling_helm_16_10,"That sounds far too extreme,"
d_counseling_helm_16_11,but I agree.
d_counseling_helm_16_12,All that I've not achieved myself isn't truly mine.
d_counseling_helm_16_13,At least that's what I think.
d_counseling_helm_16_14,Helm and I continue to chat more about benefactors.
d_counseling_helm_17_1,How do you deal with disobedient subordinates?
d_counseling_helm_17_2,"For example, let's say... drinking on the job or throwing starfish."
d_counseling_helm_17_3,"I don't have any subordinates like that, so I can't say."
d_counseling_helm_17_4,I'd join them.
d_counseling_helm_17_5,Oh...
d_counseling_helm_17_6,Right.
d_counseling_helm_17_7,I don't think many would...
d_counseling_helm_17_8,"Ya know, just go along with it?"
d_counseling_helm_17_9,"Well, I guess I'd be able to understand why they find it so enthralling."
d_counseling_helm_17_10,... But I don't drink and can't touch starfish.
d_counseling_helm_17_11,Helm and I discuss proper attitudes in the workplace.
d_counseling_helm_18_1,"Apparently, this sword I carry around bothers people, so there have been some complaints."
d_counseling_helm_18_2,"It's not even real and is completely harmless. Nevertheless, people keep mistaking it for an actual weapon."
d_counseling_helm_18_3,"I can't just leave it behind, though. So I don't know what to do."
d_counseling_helm_18_4,It's not like you can explain the situation to each and every single person you meet.
d_counseling_helm_18_5,How about stabbing all passers-by?
d_counseling_helm_18_6,True that...
d_counseling_helm_18_7,"I can't exactly write, ""Don't be scared. Not a real sword."" on my back and traipse about."
d_counseling_helm_18_8,You're right. I shouldn't let it bother me so much.
d_counseling_helm_18_9,"Hey, that's a good idea!"
d_counseling_helm_18_10,That'll prove it can't possibly harm anyone instantly.
d_counseling_helm_18_11,It's the perfect solution... but it involves assault.
d_counseling_helm_18_12,Helm and I spend time looking into different swords.
d_counseling_helm_19_1,It seems that someone used the swimming pool last night.
d_counseling_helm_19_2,Water had been splashed everywhere.
d_counseling_helm_19_3,"I don't mind people using the pool, but they should clean up after themselves."
d_counseling_helm_19_4,... Wasn't everyone out on an mission last night?
d_counseling_helm_19_5,I'll make sure it's cleaned from here on out.
d_counseling_helm_19_6,...
d_counseling_helm_19_7,"If you're trying to scare me with a lame spooky story, you can give up now."
d_counseling_helm_19_8,I don't believe in ghosts.
d_counseling_helm_19_9,I didn't expect you to say that.
d_counseling_helm_19_10,But I certainly won't turn down an offer like that.
d_counseling_helm_19_11,"I'll help out too, of course."
d_counseling_helm_19_12,Helm and I talk about which chemicals we should use to clean the pool.
d_counseling_helm_20_1,What do you think about noble causes that are doomed to fail?
d_counseling_helm_20_2,Is it a meaningless feat
d_counseling_helm_20_3,"or something we should beseech everyone to do, regardless?"
d_counseling_helm_20_4,"Fighting for a just cause should be respected, no matter what form it takes."
d_counseling_helm_20_5,"If a cause is bound to fail, then it is meaningless."
d_counseling_helm_20_6,That's how I feel as well.
d_counseling_helm_20_7,"Power comes in all forms, not just material or physical."
d_counseling_helm_20_8,"Depending on what you're fighting for, justice itself can become a form of power."
d_counseling_helm_20_9,I suppose that has an element of truth to it.
d_counseling_helm_20_10,"But if that's the case,"
d_counseling_helm_20_11,justice will become something reserved solely for those with power.
d_counseling_helm_20_12,"Meanwhile, there won't be any justice for the powerless."
d_counseling_helm_20_13,Helm and I have a heated discussion about justice.
d_counseling_laplace_01_1,Birdie!
d_counseling_laplace_01_2,What do you think is the most important when it comes to being a hero?
d_counseling_laplace_01_3,"Your mind, and your physical strength."
d_counseling_laplace_01_4,Your popularity.
d_counseling_laplace_01_5,!!
d_counseling_laplace_01_6,I see you already understand what it takes to be a hero!
d_counseling_laplace_01_7,"Well done, Birdie."
d_counseling_laplace_01_8,"No, no, no!"
d_counseling_laplace_01_9,A hero can't let themselves get caught up in trivial things like popularity.
d_counseling_laplace_01_10,"Besides, becoming a public sensation comes naturally when you vanquish enough villains."
d_counseling_laplace_01_11,I listen to Laplace go into excruciating detail about what's important to becoming a hero.
d_counseling_laplace_02_1,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages, and there's still no sign of Laplace."
d_counseling_laplace_02_2,...
d_counseling_laplace_02_3,Should I go back?
d_counseling_laplace_02_4,*Creak*
d_counseling_laplace_02_5,Tah-dah! Here I am!
d_counseling_laplace_02_6,... Sit down.
d_counseling_laplace_02_7,You're late.
d_counseling_laplace_02_8,...
d_counseling_laplace_02_9,"Sorry, I'm late."
d_counseling_laplace_02_10,"Hahaha! Sorry I'm late, Birdie!"
d_counseling_laplace_02_11,I was out fighting crime. A hero's work is never done!
d_counseling_laplace_02_12,"Well, try and be on time in the future, hero."
d_counseling_laplace_02_13,You got it!
d_counseling_laplace_02_14,I tell Laplace about other heroes who are more punctual.
d_counseling_laplace_03_1,"If you're walking down the street,"
d_counseling_laplace_03_2,"and you hear someone yell, ""Help me! I need a hero!"""
d_counseling_laplace_03_3,What would you do?
d_counseling_laplace_03_4,"Since I'm not a hero, I'd continue along my merry way."
d_counseling_laplace_03_5,I'd call you immediately.
d_counseling_laplace_03_6,!!
d_counseling_laplace_03_7,You'd ignore someone in distress?
d_counseling_laplace_03_8,You can't do that!
d_counseling_laplace_03_9,"If you do that, you're straying from the righteous path."
d_counseling_laplace_03_10,"Brilliant, Birdie!"
d_counseling_laplace_03_11,"If you're not a hero yourself,"
d_counseling_laplace_03_12,then call in someone who is.
d_counseling_laplace_03_13,That's almost certainly the best course of action.
d_counseling_laplace_03_14,Laplace and I pontificate about different ways to send a distress signal during an emergency.
d_counseling_laplace_04_1,...
d_counseling_laplace_04_2,...
d_counseling_laplace_04_3,Did you get in trouble with Maxwell?
d_counseling_laplace_04_4,Have you not eaten?
d_counseling_laplace_04_5,??
d_counseling_laplace_04_6,I refused to be lectured by Maxwell!
d_counseling_laplace_04_7,Just some friendly advice...
d_counseling_laplace_04_8,All right... I'll listen to some advice...
d_counseling_laplace_04_9,"Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?"
d_counseling_laplace_04_10,!!
d_counseling_laplace_04_11,How did you know?
d_counseling_laplace_04_12,I forgot to eat breakfast this morning.
d_counseling_laplace_04_13,A hero should know better than this. I need to take care of myself.
d_counseling_laplace_04_14,Time for some grub.
d_counseling_laplace_04_15,I spend some time having a discussion with Laplace.
d_counseling_laplace_05_1,Drake is really gung-ho about wanting to be a villain lately.
d_counseling_laplace_05_2,Why do you think that is? We're heroes after all...
d_counseling_laplace_05_3,She doesn't want to be an ordinary hero.
d_counseling_laplace_05_4,Being a villain is more interesting than being a hero.
d_counseling_laplace_05_5,Okay.
d_counseling_laplace_05_6,I think I get it now.
d_counseling_laplace_05_7,Thanks for clearing that up!
d_counseling_laplace_05_8,What?!
d_counseling_laplace_05_9,No way! That doesn't make any sense!
d_counseling_laplace_05_10,There must be another reason.
d_counseling_laplace_05_11,I talk a little more about Drake with Laplace.
d_counseling_laplace_06_1,Is there anything you think...
d_counseling_laplace_06_2,a hero can't overcome?
d_counseling_laplace_06_3,The Central Government?
d_counseling_laplace_06_4,Nothing whatsoever.
d_counseling_laplace_06_5,You think so?
d_counseling_laplace_06_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_laplace_06_7,...
d_counseling_laplace_06_8,Wait a sec!
d_counseling_laplace_06_9,"The Central Government isn't evil, so it's okay if we can't defeat them."
d_counseling_laplace_06_10,Bingo!
d_counseling_laplace_06_11,There's nothing that a hero can't overcome.
d_counseling_laplace_06_12,"That's why I need to spread the hero's gospel, right now!"
d_counseling_laplace_06_13,I calm Laplace down. She's chomping at the bit to run outside.
d_counseling_laplace_07_1,I just don't know what to do.
d_counseling_laplace_07_2,Maxwell says I should pipe down and try and be a hero without yelling.
d_counseling_laplace_07_3,"But if I don't yell, I can't unleash my full power..."
d_counseling_laplace_07_4,Use more body language and do all your yelling internally.
d_counseling_laplace_07_5,Don't let Maxwell browbeat you. Just keep shouting.
d_counseling_laplace_07_6,That's a solid idea!
d_counseling_laplace_07_7,The real power comes from the heart anyway.
d_counseling_laplace_07_8,"Body language... I'm not exactly well-versed in that,"
d_counseling_laplace_07_9,but I'll give it a try. Thanks for the advice!
d_counseling_laplace_07_10,I don't think so.
d_counseling_laplace_07_11,"I tried that a couple of times, and she said she wouldn't make me any more weapons."
d_counseling_laplace_07_12,I've got to figure something else out.
d_counseling_laplace_07_13,Laplace and I practice ways for her to unleash her heroic powers without making too much noise.
d_counseling_laplace_08_1,"If you could make one wish and have it come true,"
d_counseling_laplace_08_2,what would it be?
d_counseling_laplace_08_3,To be rich.
d_counseling_laplace_08_4,World peace.
d_counseling_laplace_08_5,So materialistic!
d_counseling_laplace_08_6,You're officially disqualified as a hero.
d_counseling_laplace_08_7,!!
d_counseling_laplace_08_8,... Incredible.
d_counseling_laplace_08_9,A truly heroic wish if there ever was one.
d_counseling_laplace_08_10,"You've come a long way, Birdie. You're a bona fide hero!"
d_counseling_laplace_08_11,Laplace and I keep thinking about ways that we could make our wishes come true.
d_counseling_laplace_09_1,Let me tell you something.
d_counseling_laplace_09_2,"The surface will be reclaimed one day, and we'll be the ones who do it."
d_counseling_laplace_09_3,"That's what Nikkes were made to do, and it's what heroes were meant to do."
d_counseling_laplace_09_4,I'm with you all the way.
d_counseling_laplace_09_5,Don't overdo it.
d_counseling_laplace_09_6,"As long as we've got you in our corner,"
d_counseling_laplace_09_7,that's the best encouragement we could ever hope for.
d_counseling_laplace_09_8,I'm not overdoing it.
d_counseling_laplace_09_9,I just said I would do what I'm meant to do.
d_counseling_laplace_09_10,"Have a little more faith in me, Birdie."
d_counseling_laplace_09_11,I speak with Laplace about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_laplace_10_1,"Hero power, charging..."
d_counseling_laplace_10_2,Go.
d_counseling_laplace_10_3,GO!!!!
d_counseling_laplace_10_4,Hmm...
d_counseling_laplace_10_5,"That's the right word, but it needs more punch."
d_counseling_laplace_10_6,You can't unleash your full heroic power unless it's got some oomph to it.
d_counseling_laplace_10_7,Put some effort into it!
d_counseling_laplace_10_8,Nicely done!
d_counseling_laplace_10_9,It's got a real punch to it. That'll unleash your heroic power for sure.
d_counseling_laplace_10_10,I'll shout like that each time I use my powers!
d_counseling_laplace_10_11,"Together with Laplace, I experiment with different sounds."
d_counseling_laplace_11_1,"Let's say there's a researcher trapped inside a burning power plant,"
d_counseling_laplace_11_2,and there's a giant water tank adjacent to the building.
d_counseling_laplace_11_3,What would you do?
d_counseling_laplace_11_4,I'd get a drink of water to calm my nerves.
d_counseling_laplace_11_5,I'd soak myself in the water and charge into the blazing inferno like a hero should.
d_counseling_laplace_11_6,Well said.
d_counseling_laplace_11_7,"Buildings are unpredictable when they're on fire, particularly a power plant."
d_counseling_laplace_11_8,Your best option is to keep calm and wait until the proper authorities arrive.
d_counseling_laplace_11_9,"I'm afraid you're wrong, Birdie."
d_counseling_laplace_11_10,You can't just go charging into any old building unless you're the right person for the job.
d_counseling_laplace_11_11,"Which, of course, would be me."
d_counseling_laplace_11_12,Laplace teaches me how to drink water without choking.
d_counseling_laplace_12_1,"Tell me, what do you think is a shortcoming of mine?"
d_counseling_laplace_12_2,Don't hold back. I won't get offended.
d_counseling_laplace_12_3,You're a bit... stentorian.
d_counseling_laplace_12_4,The fact that you have no shortcomings is your shortcoming.
d_counseling_laplace_12_5,That's because I'm filled to the brim with power.
d_counseling_laplace_12_6,That's hardly what I'd call a shortcoming.
d_counseling_laplace_12_7,It's just a matter of preference.
d_counseling_laplace_12_8,Interesting...
d_counseling_laplace_12_9,The fact I don't have any shortcomings almost makes me a supernatural force.
d_counseling_laplace_12_10,... Oh well! Nothing I can do about that.
d_counseling_laplace_12_11,I suggest ways Laplace can overcome her shortcomings while trying not to hurt her feelings.
d_counseling_laplace_13_1,"Once in a blue moon,"
d_counseling_laplace_13_2,I think about those I couldn't save.
d_counseling_laplace_13_3,I can't help feeling regretful... What if I had more power then?
d_counseling_laplace_13_4,What difference would that make?
d_counseling_laplace_13_5,All you can do is keep moving forward.
d_counseling_laplace_13_6,... You're right.
d_counseling_laplace_13_7,Feeling sorry for myself won't change anything.
d_counseling_laplace_13_8,I won't make that mistake again.
d_counseling_laplace_13_9,I do.
d_counseling_laplace_13_10,But nothing changes.
d_counseling_laplace_13_11,I can't shake this feeling of regret.
d_counseling_laplace_13_12,I spend time talking about the past with Laplace.
d_counseling_laplace_14_1,I can't take any more of Maxwell's nagging!
d_counseling_laplace_14_2,"I used water to wash a battery, and she chewed me out"
d_counseling_laplace_14_3,for an entire hour.
d_counseling_laplace_14_4,That's a bit overkill.
d_counseling_laplace_14_5,"Well, you did screw up."
d_counseling_laplace_14_6,Right?! It's too much!
d_counseling_laplace_14_7,"Sure, there was an iiiitty-bitty explosion, but it's not like anyone got hurt."
d_counseling_laplace_14_8,Only one room was destroyed.
d_counseling_laplace_14_9,"... Okay, Maxwell may be in the right."
d_counseling_laplace_14_10,I realize that!
d_counseling_laplace_14_11,But a whole hour?
d_counseling_laplace_14_12,It's too much... Too much...
d_counseling_laplace_14_13,I teach Laplace ways to let nagging wash over her like water off a duck's back.
d_counseling_laplace_15_1,"A while ago, a package was delivered in front of our building."
d_counseling_laplace_15_2,"When I opened it, there was a knife, and a small note with the word ""Kill!"" on it."
d_counseling_laplace_15_3,What do you think that's all about?
d_counseling_laplace_15_4,It means someone is accusing you of being a killer.
d_counseling_laplace_15_5,I think it may be a threat.
d_counseling_laplace_15_6,"Well, they're not wrong. I do kill."
d_counseling_laplace_15_7,"Killing it as a hero, that is!"
d_counseling_laplace_15_8,But why? Was it something I did?
d_counseling_laplace_15_9,No way. I haven't done anything wrong.
d_counseling_laplace_15_10,"Besides, threats don't scare me. I'm a hero! I'm invincible!"
d_counseling_laplace_15_11,Laplace teaches me how to properly gift-wrap a box.
d_counseling_laplace_16_1,Do you prefer beam-based weapons or ones that use live ammunition?
d_counseling_laplace_16_2,"Personally, I'm partial to beam-based weapons."
d_counseling_laplace_16_3,You can't beat live ammunition.
d_counseling_laplace_16_4,No contest. A beam weapon comes out on top.
d_counseling_laplace_16_5,Wha... how could you!
d_counseling_laplace_16_6,"I'm disappointed in you, Birdie."
d_counseling_laplace_16_7,Everyone knows beam weapons are where it's at.
d_counseling_laplace_16_8,I knew you'd agree with me!
d_counseling_laplace_16_9,"There are plenty of reasons why they're the best, but the biggest of all"
d_counseling_laplace_16_10,is that they're like a beam of light that repels evil.
d_counseling_laplace_16_11,Laplace and I go over the latest trends and tropes in mecha anime.
d_counseling_laplace_17_1,"I'm sure you're already aware of this, but I transform when I go into battle mode."
d_counseling_laplace_17_2,"It's only for a moment, but I'm totally defenseless during this transformation."
d_counseling_laplace_17_3,"If you were my enemy, what would you do?"
d_counseling_laplace_17_4,I'd take advantage of the chink in your armor.
d_counseling_laplace_17_5,I'd want a fair fight. I'd wait until you had fully transformed before fighting.
d_counseling_laplace_17_6,But that's so cowardly!
d_counseling_laplace_17_7,"I understand you don't want to let such a great opportunity pass you by,"
d_counseling_laplace_17_8,but... er...
d_counseling_laplace_17_9,you still shouldn't do it!
d_counseling_laplace_17_10,...
d_counseling_laplace_17_11,I knew you wouldn't stoop so low as to attack a defenseless opponent.
d_counseling_laplace_17_12,That's just the kind of person you are.
d_counseling_laplace_17_13,Laplace and I watch videos of different heroes transforming.
d_counseling_laplace_18_1,Today's topic is: can villains be forgiven?
d_counseling_laplace_18_2,Birdie! Tell me what you think!
d_counseling_laplace_18_3,"Yes, they can."
d_counseling_laplace_18_4,"No, they can't."
d_counseling_laplace_18_5,I can't say that I agree with you.
d_counseling_laplace_18_6,"Even if a villain changes their ways, they can never take back all the evil deeds they've committed."
d_counseling_laplace_18_7,"To me, that means they can never be forgiven."
d_counseling_laplace_18_8,"So, we're on the same page."
d_counseling_laplace_18_9,"Broken glass can never be put back together again. Even if they repent, they can't undo the damage they've done."
d_counseling_laplace_18_10,Evil acts have repercussions which last forever. They can never be erased.
d_counseling_laplace_18_11,I spend time with Laplace looking at the encyclopedia of villains.
d_counseling_laplace_19_1,I'm trying to brainstorm some new entrances.
d_counseling_laplace_19_2,"The super hero landing is tried and true, but I feel it's a bit commonplace."
d_counseling_laplace_19_3,I need a unique entrance that's still a good fit for me.
d_counseling_laplace_19_4,Transform as you walk slowly.
d_counseling_laplace_19_5,"If you don't like landing, then soar up into the air."
d_counseling_laplace_19_6,!!
d_counseling_laplace_19_7,...
d_counseling_laplace_19_8,That's... so cool!
d_counseling_laplace_19_9,"So, the opposite of landing... interesting!"
d_counseling_laplace_19_10,"But if I want to do that, I'd have to hide someplace below ahead of time."
d_counseling_laplace_19_11,A hero never hides!
d_counseling_laplace_19_12,Laplace and I look at the top 10 entrances of the Ark Rangers.
d_counseling_laplace_20_1,Birdie.
d_counseling_laplace_20_2,What do you think it means to be a hero?
d_counseling_laplace_20_3,Spending your life warding off evil and bringing light everywhere you go.
d_counseling_laplace_20_4,Running towards what everyone else runs away from.
d_counseling_laplace_20_5,Haha. That's correct.
d_counseling_laplace_20_6,But it's not so simple as just fending off evil.
d_counseling_laplace_20_7,You need to hold onto something more valuable.
d_counseling_laplace_20_8,That's right.
d_counseling_laplace_20_9,"That perfectly encapsulates what a hero should be. Someone who strives to protect others, even if it means putting themselves in danger."
d_counseling_laplace_20_10,True heroes are willing to give up their lives in defense of those who cannot protect themselves.
d_counseling_laplace_20_11,Laplace and I watch some classic superhero flicks.
d_counseling_neve_01_1,*Yawn*
d_counseling_neve_01_2,Is there any way I can keep myself from sleeping so much?
d_counseling_neve_01_3,You should sleep if you're tired.
d_counseling_neve_01_4,Try drinking coffee.
d_counseling_neve_01_5,"Haha, that's great."
d_counseling_neve_01_6,I knew you'd feel the same way.
d_counseling_neve_01_7,"Well, I'm off to bed then!"
d_counseling_neve_01_8,"I've already tried that, remember?"
d_counseling_neve_01_9,It didn't do a thing.
d_counseling_neve_01_10,I talk about sleep with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_02_1,What's your favorite kind of bear?
d_counseling_neve_02_2,"Polar bears, grizzly bears, or brown bears?"
d_counseling_neve_02_3,Polar bears.
d_counseling_neve_02_4,Grizzly bears.
d_counseling_neve_02_5,Same here.
d_counseling_neve_02_6,Isn't their fur just so cute and cuddly?
d_counseling_neve_02_7,Polar bears are the best.
d_counseling_neve_02_8,Grizzly bears?
d_counseling_neve_02_9,I thought you'd say polar bears...
d_counseling_neve_02_10,I talk about bears with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_03_1,"Burly Bear,"
d_counseling_neve_03_2,what do you think is the softest thing in the world?
d_counseling_neve_03_3,A cloud?
d_counseling_neve_03_4,The space in between my arms.
d_counseling_neve_03_5,"Hmm, I didn't think of that."
d_counseling_neve_03_6,"But now that you mention it, I suppose they would be pretty soft."
d_counseling_neve_03_7,Hehe...
d_counseling_neve_03_8,Then can you hold me for a moment?
d_counseling_neve_03_9,I was feeling sleepy anyway.
d_counseling_neve_03_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_04_1,Zzzzzz...
d_counseling_neve_04_2,Don't do anything.
d_counseling_neve_04_3,Wake Neve up.
d_counseling_neve_04_4,Zzzz...
d_counseling_neve_04_5,ZZZZZZzzzzz...
d_counseling_neve_04_6,Hey!
d_counseling_neve_04_7,What'd you wake me up for?
d_counseling_neve_04_8,I was having a great dream.
d_counseling_neve_04_9,I watch Neve go back to sleep.
d_counseling_neve_05_1,Winter is my favorite season.
d_counseling_neve_05_2,I get to wear heavy layers and get some great sleep.
d_counseling_neve_05_3,Do you like winter too?
d_counseling_neve_05_4,"I do, but I like you even more."
d_counseling_neve_05_5,Winter is too cold for me.
d_counseling_neve_05_6,"A little off-topic,"
d_counseling_neve_05_7,"but a lovely answer nonetheless, hehe! You get a pass."
d_counseling_neve_05_8,"You get cold easily, huh?"
d_counseling_neve_05_9,I don't really like summer.
d_counseling_neve_05_10,Neve and I talk about our favorite seasons.
d_counseling_neve_06_1,"I know there are a few other Nikkes who sleep,"
d_counseling_neve_06_2,but I must be the only one that sleeps this much.
d_counseling_neve_06_3,There's a possible contender called Frima.
d_counseling_neve_06_4,Most likely.
d_counseling_neve_06_5,She sleeps as much as me?
d_counseling_neve_06_6,I can't let anyone dethrone me!
d_counseling_neve_06_7,I've gotta work hard and sleep more than ever.
d_counseling_neve_06_8,"I don't know why,"
d_counseling_neve_06_9,but I feel a strange sense of pride about that.
d_counseling_neve_06_10,I talk about sleep with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_07_1,Alice is so adorable.
d_counseling_neve_07_2,Doesn't she remind you of a baby bunny?
d_counseling_neve_07_3,She's not as cute as you are.
d_counseling_neve_07_4,I'm cuter.
d_counseling_neve_07_5,"Oh my, well... thank you."
d_counseling_neve_07_6,You just made my day. I'm not even tired anymore!
d_counseling_neve_07_7,"I mean, you're not wrong!"
d_counseling_neve_07_8,"You're super cute, Burly Bear."
d_counseling_neve_07_9,I talk about cute things with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_08_1,"Every time I drink tea with Ludmilla,"
d_counseling_neve_08_2,I get so sleepy.
d_counseling_neve_08_3,Ask her for some cold tea.
d_counseling_neve_08_4,Try to sleep with your eyes open.
d_counseling_neve_08_5,Smart! I'll try it next time.
d_counseling_neve_08_6,I shouldn't be as sleepy if I drink something cold.
d_counseling_neve_08_7,"Hmm... I'm not entirely sure if that's even possible,"
d_counseling_neve_08_8,but I'll keep it in mind.
d_counseling_neve_08_9,I have a meaningful conversation with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_09_1,*Yawn*
d_counseling_neve_09_2,*Yaaaawwwn*
d_counseling_neve_09_3,*Ya*
d_counseling_neve_09_4,Boo!
d_counseling_neve_09_5,*Yaaaawwwn*
d_counseling_neve_09_6,"Wow, you finished my yawn for me!"
d_counseling_neve_09_7,*Yaaaawwwn*
d_counseling_neve_09_8,Gah!
d_counseling_neve_09_9,You scared me.
d_counseling_neve_09_10,I have a yawning competition with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_10_1,Alice and I were talking about which animal is the cutest.
d_counseling_neve_10_2,"I say polar bears are the cutest, but Alice feels rabbits are cuter."
d_counseling_neve_10_3,"What do you think, Burly Bear?"
d_counseling_neve_10_4,Polar bears are cuter.
d_counseling_neve_10_5,Rabbits are cuter.
d_counseling_neve_10_6,I knew it. Nothing tops polar bears.
d_counseling_neve_10_7,Who can resist all that cuddly cuteness?
d_counseling_neve_10_8,I suppose rabbits are pretty cute too.
d_counseling_neve_10_9,Alice will be happy to hear you say that.
d_counseling_neve_10_10,Neve and I talk about our favorite animals.
d_counseling_neve_11_1,Do you ever feel lonely?
d_counseling_neve_11_2,"Sometimes when I'm out searching for polar bears,"
d_counseling_neve_11_3,I get a little lonesome.
d_counseling_neve_11_4,Why don't you have Alice and Ludmilla join you?
d_counseling_neve_11_5,I can always join you.
d_counseling_neve_11_6,They're both busy with their own jobs.
d_counseling_neve_11_7,Although it would be fun if we searched together.
d_counseling_neve_11_8,You will?
d_counseling_neve_11_9,That's great! When can you come up?
d_counseling_neve_11_10,I'll come and pick you up.
d_counseling_neve_11_11,I have a meaningful conversation with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_12_1,"If you could give me a nickname,"
d_counseling_neve_12_2,what would it be?
d_counseling_neve_12_3,The Sleep Queen.
d_counseling_neve_12_4,Sleepyhead.
d_counseling_neve_12_5,"Oooh, that has a nice ring to it"
d_counseling_neve_12_6,"Ludmilla is the Snow Queen,"
d_counseling_neve_12_7,so it's only fitting that I'm the Sleep Queen.
d_counseling_neve_12_8,Sleepyhead?
d_counseling_neve_12_9,I thought you'd come up with something a bit more... elegant?
d_counseling_neve_12_10,I have a conversation about nicknames with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_13_1,"If you had to name one positive quality about me,"
d_counseling_neve_13_2,what would it be?
d_counseling_neve_13_3,Umm... well... let me think...
d_counseling_neve_13_4,There are so many. I can't possibly choose just one.
d_counseling_neve_13_5,"If it's taking you that long to come up with something,"
d_counseling_neve_13_6,I'll take it that means I don't have any positive qualities at all.
d_counseling_neve_13_7,You're too kind.
d_counseling_neve_13_8,I was going to say the same thing about you.
d_counseling_neve_13_9,I have a meaningful conversation with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_14_1,"I've always wondered,"
d_counseling_neve_14_2,why do people get so scared when they see a polar bear up close?
d_counseling_neve_14_3,Because they're known for eating people.
d_counseling_neve_14_4,Beats me. I think they're cute.
d_counseling_neve_14_5,"Hmm... I suppose if you thought about them that way,"
d_counseling_neve_14_6,then they would seem pretty scary.
d_counseling_neve_14_7,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_neve_14_8,Great minds think alike.
d_counseling_neve_14_9,They're just so round and fluffy!
d_counseling_neve_14_10,I have a conversation about polar bears with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_15_1,What is it about sleep that makes it so great?
d_counseling_neve_15_2,Is there anything in the world sweeter than sleep?
d_counseling_neve_15_3,A kiss from me.
d_counseling_neve_15_4,Chocolate.
d_counseling_neve_15_5,"Oooh, it is?"
d_counseling_neve_15_6,Any chance I can see for myself?
d_counseling_neve_15_7,It was only a figure of speech.
d_counseling_neve_15_8,You don't have to take everything so literally.
d_counseling_neve_15_9,I have a conversation about sweet things with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_16_1,"Burly Bear,"
d_counseling_neve_16_2,"I don't snore when I sleep, do I?"
d_counseling_neve_16_3,Louder than anyone I've ever heard.
d_counseling_neve_16_4,I've never heard you snore.
d_counseling_neve_16_5,... Really?
d_counseling_neve_16_6,I thought I didn't...
d_counseling_neve_16_7,"Phew, that's a relief."
d_counseling_neve_16_8,I was worried that
d_counseling_neve_16_9,what if you had heard me snore.
d_counseling_neve_16_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_17_1,How are you not tired right now?
d_counseling_neve_17_2,I'm even sleepier than usual...
d_counseling_neve_17_3,Then get some sleep.
d_counseling_neve_17_4,Can't you fight the urge to sleep?
d_counseling_neve_17_5,If you say so.
d_counseling_neve_17_6,"You know me, I never turn down a chance to sleep."
d_counseling_neve_17_7,Make sure to wake me up later.
d_counseling_neve_17_8,"I tried, but it doesn't work."
d_counseling_neve_17_9,Actually... I feel like I... I'm gonna fall asleep now...
d_counseling_neve_17_10,Zzzz...
d_counseling_neve_17_11,I keep quiet so as not to wake up Neve.
d_counseling_neve_18_1,People say that polar bears are fond of that dark brown carbonated drink.
d_counseling_neve_18_2,"What about you, Burly Bear? Which soft drink do you prefer?"
d_counseling_neve_18_3,Green carbonated drink.
d_counseling_neve_18_4,Brown carbonated drink.
d_counseling_neve_18_5,"The only thing about that is,"
d_counseling_neve_18_6,it doesn't give you so much sweetness that brown drink does.
d_counseling_neve_18_7,You can't go wrong with that!
d_counseling_neve_18_8,I prefer brown carbonated drink as well.
d_counseling_neve_18_9,I have a conversation about drinks we like with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_19_1,"Whenever you're asleep,"
d_counseling_neve_19_2,what do you dream about?
d_counseling_neve_19_3,Of being around you.
d_counseling_neve_19_4,I don't dream.
d_counseling_neve_19_5,No kidding!
d_counseling_neve_19_6,"Sometimes, I dream of being with you too."
d_counseling_neve_19_7,"Although usually, I'm dreaming about frolicking with polar bears."
d_counseling_neve_19_8,You don't?
d_counseling_neve_19_9,Sleeping must be super relaxing for you then.
d_counseling_neve_19_10,I have a conversation about dreams with Neve.
d_counseling_neve_20_1,"Even though polar bears are what I'm after,"
d_counseling_neve_20_2,I've run into all sorts of wildlife in my search.
d_counseling_neve_20_3,Are there any other animals you want to see besides polar bears?
d_counseling_neve_20_4,An arctic hare.
d_counseling_neve_20_5,A killer whale.
d_counseling_neve_20_6,"An arctic hare, huh?"
d_counseling_neve_20_7,"I bet they'd be super cute, just like a polar bear."
d_counseling_neve_20_8,Let's try and find one on our next search!
d_counseling_neve_20_9,A killer whale?
d_counseling_neve_20_10,They seem a little scary to me.
d_counseling_neve_20_11,Neve and I talk about which animals we'd most like to see.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_1,Winter is such a beautiful season.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_2,"At nighttime, the Christmas lights sparkle,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_3,and every store has a Christmas tree in their front display.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_4,I'm thinking of putting one in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_5,It's the most beautiful season of the year.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_6,*Gasp*
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_7,"Really? If you do, can I come see it?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_8,I promise to keep quiet.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_9,Absolutely!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_10,Other seasons are...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_11,Actually... I don't know much about other seasons.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_01_12,I have a conversation about the specialties of winter with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_1,Rupee was telling me there's a dessert on Royal Road that's only sold during the winter.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_2,The line is apparently really long though.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_3,Let's go together and wait in line.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_4,I can go and get some for you if you like.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_5,You'd be willing to do that with me?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_6,"As long as I'm with you, the line won't seem so long since time passes so quickly."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_7,But... then you'd have to wait by yourself.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_8,I don't want that.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_02_9,Anne and I talk more about seasonal desserts.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_1,"Teacher, have you ever used frosting when making cookies?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_2,"Emma said it can be fun, but that you need to have decent drawing skills as well."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_3,"How the cookies taste is what's important, not how they look."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_4,"If you're good at drawing, that's great, but it's not mandatory."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_5,...!!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_6,Emma is always so creative with her cooking. And it's always super tasty.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_7,"I guess there's no reason to be nervous. Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_8,... I don't get it.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_9,Do I need to be good at drawing or don't I?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_03_10,I look up more information on cookie frosting with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_1,It feels to me that the Ark is filled with people who like video games.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_2,"Exia is always carrying around her GameKid,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_3,and Maiden does cosplay... although I'm not entirely sure what that's all about.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_4,"Nothing wrong with video games, but those two take it to the extreme."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_5,It's good to have hobbies.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_6,You think so?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_7,"Even so, they both look so happy."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_8,I'd like to have a hobby like that one day.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_9,"That's what I think, too."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_10,"I always enjoy visiting downtown with you, Teacher. Hehe."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_04_11,I recommend a game for beginners to Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_1,Teacher! I just found out the coolest thing.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_2,There's a place on the surface where the snow is piled up as high as your head!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_3,"In those kinds of places, you have to watch out for avalanches."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_4,"The next time I go to the Northern Base, do you want to come along?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_5,An ava-what?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_6,"I don't know what that is, but it sounds dangerous."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_7,"In that case, I'll steer clear of those areas."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_8,I'd love to!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_9,This is my first time hearing about this place. It sounds like there's an incredible amount of snow there though.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_10,You think there will be enough there to make a snowman?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_05_11,I have a conversation about the northern base with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_1,Teacher...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_2,Do you have a family?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_3,"To be honest, I can't remember."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_4,You all are my family.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_5,...!!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_6,I'm sorry.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_7,"I'm sure they were nice people, just like you."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_8,"Sorry for asking, I'll be more careful next time."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_9,We... we are?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_10,There's nothing in my notebook that mentions that...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_11,...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_12,Is that why Rupee always calls you Sweetie?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_06_13,I have a conversation about families with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_1,Rupee is so pretty.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_2,Maybe that's why she has as many friends as she does.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_3,Do you think I'll have that many friends one day?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_4,Everyone is uniquely charming in their own way.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_5,You can achieve anything you put your mind to.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_7,"I'm not sure exactly where my charms lie,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_8,"but if you say so, then I'll believe you."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_9,Wow...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_10,I really hope so.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_11,Then one day I'll have my own group of friends!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_07_12,Anne and I discuss what kind of person we want to be in the future.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_1,Teacher!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_2,I've decided. I'm going to be a mail carrier.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_3,How'd you come to this decision?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_4,Is it just because you want to ride a motorcycle?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_5,"Every time I see Sugar riding her motorcycle, I want to take it for a spin."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_6,But I think she may not let me.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_7,Do you know how to become a mail carrier anyway?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_8,Yeah!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_9,"Every time I see Sugar riding her motorcycle, I want to take it for a spin."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_10,Then let's ask her for a ride.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_11,Do you think she'd be okay with that?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_08_12,"After our session, I decide to take Anne over to see Sugar."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_1,"Teacher, I have a bit of a weird question."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_2,"Is it really true that if you hang a sock on the wall during the holidays, it'll be stuffed with gifts the next morning?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_3,That's right. Just let me know if you decide to hang one.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_4,"It's true, but only for children who have been nice."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_5,"Okay,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_6,be sure to put in a good word for me with the fairy!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_7,"Wow, is there anyone you don't know?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_8,Oh... then I might not get anything.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_9,Something tells me that won't be the case.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_10,!!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_11,"If you think so, then I'll try it out tonight!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_09_12,I start to think about what to put inside the sock.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_1,"Teacher, have you ever had a snowball fight?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_2,"Neon says that if you scrunch up some snow and throw it, it makes a big explosion."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_3,Snow isn't explosive.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_4,It only did that because Neon tampered with it.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_5,!!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_6,True... the snow that fell in the Ark felt a lot like cotton candy.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_7,I think Neon was just messing with me.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_8,Wow! That's incredible!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_9,Could you use a snowball to take down a Rapture?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_10_10,Anne and I discuss the finer points of snowball fight techniques.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_1,Emma and I are going to bake a cake today. What shape should I make it into?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_2,You decide for me.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_3,A snowman.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_4,Why don't you just buy a cake instead?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_5,"Oooh, that'll look great!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_6,I've gotta hurry and tell Emma.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_7,Huh? Why would I do that?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_8,"I've never made a cake before, so I was really looking forward to trying it out."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_11_9,I have a conversation about cake with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_1,Lalala♬
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_2,Do you often sing Christmas carols?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_3,"When it's going to be Christmas, sure."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_4,Singing really isn't my cup of tea.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_5,What's your favorite?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_6,I love the ones that mention Santa.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_7,That's too bad...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_8,I was really excited to sing some Christmas songs with you.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_12_9,I spend time with Anne singing Christmas songs.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_1,Teacher!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_2,I've had a lot of people tell me that marshmallows and some kind of hot drink are the ultimate combo.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_3,What was the drink called again...?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_4,Hot chocolate?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_5,Coffee?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_6,"Yes, that was it!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_7,I've never tried it before. I wonder how it tastes?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_8,"No, it wasn't coffee."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_9,Isn't coffee supposed to be bitter?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_10,"Rupee says I'm too young to drink coffee, but that I'll probably drink lots of it when I'm older."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_13_11,Anne and I talk more about drinks that warm you up.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_1,"If there was one person you could write a letter to wish them season's greetings,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_2,who would it be?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_3,"You, of course."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_4,Santa Claus.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_5,To me? Then I'll write back to you!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_6,Can we start now?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_7,What would you tell him?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_8,"As for me, I'd write a letter to you."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_14_9,I spend time writing letters with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_1,"Even though nothing out of the ordinary happened today,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_2,I feel so content.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_3,"If you're happy, then I'm happy."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_4,Those are the best days.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_5,"Well, I'm happy that you're happy that I'm happy, haha!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_6,"Wow, it's kinda like a happiness spiral."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_7,"... Teacher, did something bad happen?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_8,You look a little down.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_15_9,I have a conversation about feelings with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_1,I got invited to a party today.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_2,Should I bring a gift or something like that?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_3,I don't know anything since it's my first time.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_4,You don't have to do that.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_5,Bring a snack or some kind of party favor.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_6,Is it really okay to come empty-handed?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_7,I feel like I should bring something...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_8,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_9,What kind of snack should I bring?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_16_10,I have a conversation about parties with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_1,Everyone's been talking a lot about Christmas miracles lately.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_2,Do you believe in miracles?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_3,Yes. I believe in miracles.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_4,No. There's no such thing as miracles.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_5,Me too.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_6,"I feel like a miracle is going to happen soon, don't you? I don't know what it'll be though."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_7,How come?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_8,"Personally, I believe that miracles do exist."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_17_9,I have a conversation about miracles with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_1,Teacher!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_2,Merry Christmas!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_3,"Merry Christmas, Anne."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_4,Today isn't Christmas...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_5,Apparently everyone greets each other like this during the holidays.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_6,"It feels nice, especially coming from you!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_7,Whoops.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_8,"I thought you could say it as a normal greeting, like ""Hello."""
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_9,I guess I had it wrong...
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_18_10,I have a conversation about Christmas greetings with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_1,"Teacher, have you ever been on a sleigh before?"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_2,Apparently you can only ride them in the snow.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_3,Would you like to ride one now?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_4,I can't say I have.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_5,!!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_6,Can we really? Then let's go!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_7,"Oh, I thought you had..."
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_8,"In that case, let's go for a sleigh ride together!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_19_9,I have a conversation about sleighs with Anne.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_1,"If you only had one wish,"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_2,what would you wish for?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_3,For you to be happy.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_4,Nothing. I'm perfectly happy right now.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_5,You'd use your only wish on me?
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_6,Hmm... then I'd wish for you to be happy too!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_7,Then I'll make a wish for you!
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_8,I'd wish for you to stay happy forever.
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_9,"Oh, and Rupee too! Oh, and Emma, and... agh, too many!"
d_counseling_anne_miraclefairy_20_10,I have a conversation about wishes with Anne.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_1,"Hey, Sweetie."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_2,The last day of the year is the most special day of the year.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_3,What's a good way to ring in the New Year?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_4,Going on a date with your loved one.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_5,Participating in a massive gaming event.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_6,That does sound nice.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_7,Then... check out this!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_8,"""Top 10 Dating Hotspots to Ring in the New Year"". You can choose one from this list... but two would be even better!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_9,Interesting...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_10,Any chance I could join?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_01_11,I have a conversation about end-of-the-year plans with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_1,"Sweetie, come over here. Let's take a photo together."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_2,"One, two..."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_3,Nikke!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_4,Shut eyes.

d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_6,Let's see how it turned out.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_7,"*Gasp* You're not gonna believe this Sweetie, but..."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_8,I think I just took an all-time greatest photo of us!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_9,*Click*
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_10,Let's see how it turned out.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_11,...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_12,Do you not like taking photos with me or something?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_02_13,I spend time editing photos with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_1,REC.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_2,Helloooo! My lovely Lupins.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_3,"A lot of people have been curious about what Commander Sweetie and I do on an average day,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_4,"so for this video,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_5,I'll be preparing a special vlog recording our advising session.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_6,I'll hand it over to Sweetie to explain the rest.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_7,Talk about the importance of Nikkes and their mental health.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_8,"Explain how this is mainly where you give Nikkes their salary, and not much else."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_9,"So professional, am I right everyone?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_10,"If it weren't for these sessions, we Nikkes might not have the courage to keep fighting."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_11,Sweetie! We're live right now!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_12,What are your superiors going to think when they see this?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_03_13,I help Rupee make a vlog about our advising session.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_1,"Anne looks just like a fairy, doesn't she?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_2,Sometimes I think about how nice it'd be if I were like that.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_3,Everyone is uniquely charming in their own way.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_4,I like you just the way you are.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_5,I know...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_6,"It was just a random thought, that's all. Hehe."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_7,...!!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_8,You're making me emotional...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_9,You're... you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_04_10,I discuss with Rupee about Anne's cuteness.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_1,I'm a little concerned our new winter accessories are underperforming.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_2,Is there any way we can promote them better?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_3,Wear them in your next video.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_4,Increase the marketing budget.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_5,*Gasp*
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_6,I'm such an idiot! Why didn't I think of that?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_7,Here I was considering spending money to hire a model.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_9,"To tell you the truth, I've been putting a bigger focus on clothing this winter than accessories."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_10,I don't have much money to spare on the marketing side of things.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_05_11,Both of us think hard about ways to promote the new winter accessories.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_1,"'Tis the season, and you know what that means? Shopping!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_2,How about we go shopping when we're done talking?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_3,"On a cold day like this, you ought to stay indoors."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_4,"Sure, we can buy some winter clothes."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_5,Good point.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_6,So what you're saying is...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_7,we should stay inside and shop online?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_8,You'd look great in the newest fashions!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_9,I can see it now... you covered head to toe in the latest winter fashions.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_10,You'll look so cool!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_06_11,Rupee and I discuss our winter shopping plans.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_1,"I want to buy some Christmas ornaments,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_2,but I already bought so many. There's barely enough room left on the tree.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_3,Sounds like you have to swap out some of the ornaments.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_4,Then let's buy another tree.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_5,I can't do that!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_6,I love each and every last one of my decorations!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_7,I don't know. I'll keep thinking and see if I come up with something.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_8,That's genius!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_9,Your IQ must be like... 500 or something.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_07_10,I look around for Christmas ornaments with Rupee in the online shopping mall.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_1,"Whenever I'm outside and hear people singing Christmas songs,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_2,I always end up thinking of a special someone.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_3,Who's that?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_4,I'm the same way.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_5,...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_6,"You're awfully slow sometimes, Sweetie."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_7,"Oh, really? Who do you think of?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_8,"It's not... me, by any chance, is it?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_08_9,I have a conversation with Rupee about Christmas songs.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_1,Hehe!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_2,I'm in a good mood today.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_3,I'm enjoying spending time with you too.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_4,Did you get the coupons?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_5,You really mean it?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_6,It's like you can read my mind!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_7,Sometimes...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_8,It feels like you think all I do is shopping.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_9,"Which, of course, is totally right."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_09_10,I enjoy a fun time with the tension high Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_1,"Sweetie, which do I look better in?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_2,White or black?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_3,"White, obviously."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_4,I prefer black. It's sexier.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_5,I think so too.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_6,"I was buying my winter clothes, and I think I pull off white much better."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_7,"Of course, I'm always open to trying black someday."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_8,Really?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_9,"I mean, of course I'm all for sex appeal,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_10,but I don't think black is the way to go this winter.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_10_11,Rupee and I talk about what colors suit her best.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_1,"Sweetie, Sweetie!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_2,How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_3,I never stopped believing in Santa.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_4,Santa... doesn't exist?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_5,You're kidding.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_6,I always thought he wasn't real.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_7,"Well, since you're such a believer, I may have to reconsider."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_8,Let's think about what presents we should ask him for this year.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_9,?!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_10,I'm sorry! I didn't know you actually believed in him...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_11_11,I have a debate with Rupee about Santa Claus' existence.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_1,The year is nearly over.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_2,Do you have any vacation plans?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_3,I'm going to kick back and relax on my own.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_4,None. Help me plan something.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_5,Right... it's nice to have some time alone every once in a while.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_6,I'll do the same.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_7,Does that mean you could spend time with me?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_8,Sure.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_9,"You better be serious, because I am."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_10,I'll make this a vacation that you'll never forget.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_12_11,I spend time with Rupee while vacation planning.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_1,The temperature has really gone down.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_2,"I'm fine with it, but what about you? Aren't you freezing?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_3,"I could use a few more layers, yeah."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_4,It's okay. You can hold my hand.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_5,"Hehe, I knew this would happen, so I brought a coat just for you."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_6,Try it on.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_7,Do you really think that would work?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_8,Rupee gently takes my hand.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_9,"Actually, my hand feels a bit warmer now too."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_13_10,I spend a warm moment with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_1,It's really cold tonight. How about we go eat something that'll warm us up?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_2,I'm sure we'll be able to find something in the Ark.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_3,Let's just have some Ramen Splendamin.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_4,I think a place just opened up that sells truffle soup.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_5,You mean the stuff they sell at Talentum Mall?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_6,I've never tried it... but I'm willing to try if you come along.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_7,I've been wanting to go there for ages now!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_8,Apparently it's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_9,Let's go right now!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_14_10,Rupee and I warm ourselves up with some tasty treats.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_1,I may have gone overboard with the shopping lately. I'm a bit tired.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_2,*Yawn*
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_3,How can shopping make you tired?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_4,You can lean on my shoulder if you want.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_5,"Hehe, you saw right through me."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_6,"To be honest, I just wanted to put my head on your shoulder."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_7,Rupee grabs my arm and pulls herself closer.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_8,Ah... this is the stuff.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_9,Can I?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_10,Well... don't mind if I do!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_15_11,I spend some nice quiet time with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_1,Pop quiz!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_2,When do you find me most appealing?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_3,When you've just stepped out of the shower.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_4,When you're out on a date.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_5,"Eww, you're creepy."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_6,"But then again, that means you appreciate me in my natural state..."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_7,...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_8,"All right, from now on I'll show that ""side"" of me more often."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_9,"That's because I'm over the moon whenever I'm out with you, Sweetie!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_10,So that's when I'm at my best.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_11,I'm glad you noticed how happy you make me!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_16_12,I listen to Rupee as she tell me about how makeup can create different moods.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_1,"The last time it snowed in the Outpost,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_2,30 couples got married.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_3,A wedding on a snowy day... Isn't it romantic?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_4,Would you like to rehearse?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_5,"Someday, we'll be able to see snow on the surface."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_6,Rehearse? With who?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_7,With me.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_8,I just imagined it...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_9,what a wonderful image.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_10,"If anyone can do it, it's you, Sweetie."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_11,And I'll be there to help!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_17_12,I have a conversation with Rupee about our dream wedding.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_1,"I'm trying to have a New Year's party,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_2,but I'm not sure what kind of party it should be.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_3,A black tie event for celebrities and your clients.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_4,A casual get-together with your fans and other livestreamers.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_5,Are you sure?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_6,"They are valuable clients, and it would help with future sales,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_7,but it'd also be so boring...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_8,I was thinking of something similar.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_9,"The year is nearly over, so we should end it in style. I can have other streamers join my livestream."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_10,"Of course, you and I will be the main highlight. Maybe we should do something like a couple's dance?"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_18_11,I plan a New Year's party with Rupee.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_1,I'm going through some rough times right now.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_2,"It's the end of the year, and I have so many purchases to make, and all these documents to process..."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_3,It's been days since my last livestream...
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_4,It's tough being the one in charge.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_5,I know it's hard. Let me give you a massage.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_6,I never envisioned myself in this line of work.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_7,Wouldn't it be nice if we could just do the things that we enjoy?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_8,"Hehe, thanks!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_9,It'll be nice to take a load off.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_19_10,"I console Rupee, who has been swamped with paperwork."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_1,Our mall is preparing a year-end sale.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_2,What catchphrase should we use to hook people in?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_3,May your Christmas be a luxurious one. All high-end products are on sale.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_4,Get the latest holiday fashions for you and your loved ones.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_5,"Not bad, but it's a little wordy."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_6,"I'll think it over. If I can't come up with anything else, I'll go with your suggestion."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_7,"Thanks, Sweetie."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_8,!!!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_9,"A lot of people who watch my channel have significant others, so that could really appeal to them!"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_10,"Oooh! You could also dress up for a photo shoot,"
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_11,and I could use it for advertising!
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_12,Me?
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_13,Of course! I wouldn't want anybody else.
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_14,"It'd also be my way of showing you off, hehe."
d_counseling_rupee_wintershopper_20_15,Rupee and I continue to brainstorm ideas.
d_counseling_viper_01_1,Honey!
d_counseling_viper_01_2,"If you had to choose between simple and fancy, what would it be?"
d_counseling_viper_01_3,Simple.
d_counseling_viper_01_4,Fancy.
d_counseling_viper_01_5,I knew I could count on you!
d_counseling_viper_01_6,I wanted to do a little something different with my nails this time around. You must have sensed it!
d_counseling_viper_01_7,"Hmm, I was thinking of doing something a little different with my nails this time around..."
d_counseling_viper_01_8,"but if you prefer a fancy look, then I'll go with that."
d_counseling_viper_01_9,I spend time watching Viper paint her nails.
d_counseling_viper_02_1,A or B? Choose one.
d_counseling_viper_02_2,No questions.
d_counseling_viper_02_3,A.
d_counseling_viper_02_4,B.
d_counseling_viper_02_5,Darn.
d_counseling_viper_02_6,Viper grabs my hand and lifts it up to her mouth.
d_counseling_viper_02_7,*Smooch*
d_counseling_viper_02_8,"If you get it right next time, I'll kiss you somewhere else!"
d_counseling_viper_02_9,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_viper_02_10,Viper grabs my shoulder and pulls me close.
d_counseling_viper_02_11,*Smooch*
d_counseling_viper_02_12,Well? Happy with your choice?
d_counseling_viper_02_13,Hmm... you don't seem too happy...
d_counseling_viper_02_14,Should I have prepared something more substantial?
d_counseling_viper_02_15,Viper smiles mischievously.
d_counseling_viper_03_1,"When you're drinking a milkshake,"
d_counseling_viper_03_2,"do you eat the cherry right away, or save it for last?"
d_counseling_viper_03_3,I usually eat it first.
d_counseling_viper_03_4,I save it for last.
d_counseling_viper_03_5,Same here.
d_counseling_viper_03_6,That way no one else can eat it before you do.
d_counseling_viper_03_7,Hehe!
d_counseling_viper_03_8,Really? I like to eat it straight away.
d_counseling_viper_03_9,"If you try and save it for later,"
d_counseling_viper_03_10,someone greedy like me could come along and snatch it up!
d_counseling_viper_03_11,I go with Viper to get a milkshake.
d_counseling_viper_04_1,"Tell me, Honey."
d_counseling_viper_04_2,"Do you prefer the Ark, or the surface?"
d_counseling_viper_04_3,The surface.
d_counseling_viper_04_4,The Ark.
d_counseling_viper_04_5,There aren't enough people up there for me.
d_counseling_viper_04_6,"I need to be somewhere where there are a lot of people, and lots of fun things to do."
d_counseling_viper_04_7,You can't do that up on the surface.
d_counseling_viper_04_8,Haha!
d_counseling_viper_04_9,Me too!
d_counseling_viper_04_10,"Since the Ark has a lot of people,"
d_counseling_viper_04_11,you can do all sorts of fun things!
d_counseling_viper_04_12,Viper and I talk more about how fun it is living in the Ark.
d_counseling_viper_05_1,Ahem...
d_counseling_viper_05_2,Viper taps my toes lightly with hers.
d_counseling_viper_05_3,Ahem...
d_counseling_viper_05_4,Her toes creep up past my foot and towards my ankle.
d_counseling_viper_05_5,Ahem!
d_counseling_viper_05_6,Her toes move up towards the inside of my calf.
d_counseling_viper_05_7,Grab Viper by the ankle.
d_counseling_viper_05_8,Run away from Viper.
d_counseling_viper_05_9,!!
d_counseling_viper_05_10,"Ow, not so rough!"
d_counseling_viper_05_11,"That hurts, you know!"
d_counseling_viper_05_12,"Rather than manhandle me, you could just run away..."
d_counseling_viper_05_13,"Hehe, sorry Honey."
d_counseling_viper_05_14,Did I surprise you?
d_counseling_viper_05_15,Aren't you just the cutest thing?
d_counseling_viper_05_16,I spend time flirting with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_06_1,Do you prefer crows or snakes?
d_counseling_viper_06_2,Crows.
d_counseling_viper_06_3,Snakes.
d_counseling_viper_06_4,Really?
d_counseling_viper_06_5,But crows are so dark and forbidding...
d_counseling_viper_06_6,I didn't expect you to be into that kind of thing.
d_counseling_viper_06_7,I knew we'd agree.
d_counseling_viper_06_8,Snakes are way better than crows.
d_counseling_viper_06_9,They're so cute and cuddly!
d_counseling_viper_06_10,Viper and I talk more about our favorite animals.
d_counseling_viper_07_1,"I wonder,"
d_counseling_viper_07_2,should I tell you about a secret I've been hiding?
d_counseling_viper_07_3,"If you tell me, what will you want in return?"
d_counseling_viper_07_4,You don't need to tell me.
d_counseling_viper_07_5,"My Honey is one step ahead, as always."
d_counseling_viper_07_6,Don't think of it as me wanting something in return.
d_counseling_viper_07_7,"It's just that if we exchange our deepest and darkest secrets, you and I..."
d_counseling_viper_07_8,Might become closer than we were before.
d_counseling_viper_07_9,Would you like that?
d_counseling_viper_07_10,You don't have to be so standoffish...
d_counseling_viper_07_11,I was trying to get a little closer to you.
d_counseling_viper_07_12,Don't you want that?
d_counseling_viper_07_13,Viper and I share some of our secrets with one another.
d_counseling_viper_08_1,The weather is so nice today!
d_counseling_viper_08_2,I want to go somewhere.
d_counseling_viper_08_3,Want to go shopping?
d_counseling_viper_08_4,Want to go on a date?
d_counseling_viper_08_5,"I like shopping as much as the next person, but don't you have any other ideas?"
d_counseling_viper_08_6,"I feel like with shopping, we'd just stare at some items for a while before saying goodbye, and that's it."
d_counseling_viper_08_7,"I want to do a lot of other things with you,
not just shopping..."
d_counseling_viper_08_8,I'd love that!
d_counseling_viper_08_9,What should we do? We could go for a walk in the park...
d_counseling_viper_08_10,That way we could be alone...
d_counseling_viper_08_11,I talk with Viper about what we would do when we go to the Ark.
d_counseling_viper_09_1,Jackal is such a brown-noser.
d_counseling_viper_09_2,It's like she can't even think for herself.
d_counseling_viper_09_3,"If Crow told her to jump off a bridge, she'd probably do it."
d_counseling_viper_09_4,Do you think that's why Crow likes Jackal more than me?
d_counseling_viper_09_5,Are you jealous of Jackal?
d_counseling_viper_09_6,You have plenty of your own positive qualities.
d_counseling_viper_09_7,Absolutely not!
d_counseling_viper_09_8,How could anyone be jealous of a mindless sycophant?
d_counseling_viper_09_9,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_viper_09_10,"I'm me, and no one else. I don't have to be like Jackal."
d_counseling_viper_09_11,I'd hate spending my life as a brainless lackey. How could I ever be jealous of Jackal?
d_counseling_viper_09_12,"Besides, if there's anyone whose affection I'm after,"
d_counseling_viper_09_13,"it's you, not Crow."
d_counseling_viper_09_14,So I was hoping... you could show me some affection...
d_counseling_viper_09_15,I take my hand and caress Viper's face.
d_counseling_viper_10_1,What's the best thing about living in the Outer Rim?
d_counseling_viper_10_2,I don't know.
d_counseling_viper_10_3,I get to see you often.
d_counseling_viper_10_4,"While I appreciate your honesty,"
d_counseling_viper_10_5,you should try a little harder to come up with something.
d_counseling_viper_10_6,"If someone from the Outer Rim heard you say that, they might feel hurt."
d_counseling_viper_10_7,"Pssh, you're really laying it on thick."
d_counseling_viper_10_8,You're only saying that because you couldn't come up with an actual answer.
d_counseling_viper_10_9,Nevertheless... it does make me feel good hearing that.
d_counseling_viper_10_10,*Smooch*
d_counseling_viper_10_11,I talk a little more about the Outer Rim with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_11_1,Honey! One of our squadmates sold out to the Ark in exchange for a place to live there.
d_counseling_viper_11_2,"They've been feeding them information on what the Boss, Jackal, and I have been up to the past few days."
d_counseling_viper_11_3,"They've been on us like white on rice, asking us all sorts of questions."
d_counseling_viper_11_4,It's enough to make your blood boil.
d_counseling_viper_11_5,I managed to catch them in the act yesterday.
d_counseling_viper_11_6,What do you think I should do with them?
d_counseling_viper_11_7,Just don't kill them.
d_counseling_viper_11_8,...
d_counseling_viper_11_9,"Come on, don't you trust me?"
d_counseling_viper_11_10,Nobody's going to kill anybody.
d_counseling_viper_11_11,Why aren't you saying anything?
d_counseling_viper_11_12,Are you nervous?
d_counseling_viper_11_13,"Wait, do you think I'm planning on killing them?"
d_counseling_viper_11_14,Give me some credit.
d_counseling_viper_11_15,Who am I going to kill when I've got this around my neck?
d_counseling_viper_11_16,"Besides, I believe in having ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"". I won't go overboard."
d_counseling_viper_11_17,I never do anything more than it.
d_counseling_viper_11_18,That's just kindness for you.
d_counseling_viper_11_19,I have a sweet but dangerous session with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_12_1,"When you're eating candy,"
d_counseling_viper_12_2,"do you like eating it in one bite, or letting it melt slowly in your mouth?"
d_counseling_viper_12_3,Eating it all in one bite.
d_counseling_viper_12_4,Letting it melt slowly in my mouth.
d_counseling_viper_12_5,No way! Eating it that way is no fun.
d_counseling_viper_12_6,"If you eat it all in one bite,"
d_counseling_viper_12_7,you don't even get to taste it.
d_counseling_viper_12_8,Nice! Isn't it the best?
d_counseling_viper_12_9,It's no fun eating it all in one bite.
d_counseling_viper_12_10,"If you let it melt slowly,"
d_counseling_viper_12_11,you can really appreciate the flavor.
d_counseling_viper_12_12,I share a candy with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_13_1,"Honey, who do you think is in a worse position?"
d_counseling_viper_13_2,"Someone who steals, or someone who gets stolen from?"
d_counseling_viper_13_3,Someone who steals.
d_counseling_viper_13_4,Being stolen from.
d_counseling_viper_13_5,"Hmm, I think the opposite."
d_counseling_viper_13_6,"If something is precious to you, then you should be able to keep it safe."
d_counseling_viper_13_7,"If you can't do that, then you're better off letting someone else have it."
d_counseling_viper_13_8,"How am I the bad guy,"
d_counseling_viper_13_9,when nobody can look after their valuables properly?
d_counseling_viper_13_10,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_viper_13_11,"Everyone else seems to think the person who steals is in the wrong, so I'm always painted as the bad guy."
d_counseling_viper_13_12,"But I always say that if someone really values something, they'd do a better job of protecting it!"
d_counseling_viper_13_13,"If you can't keep something safe, then you're better off letting someone else have it."
d_counseling_viper_13_14,I discuss with Viper how best to protect things precious to us.
d_counseling_viper_14_1,"If I didn't have this choker on my neck,"
d_counseling_viper_14_2,what do you think would be the first thing I'd do?
d_counseling_viper_14_3,... Kill me?
d_counseling_viper_14_4,... Terrorize the Ark?
d_counseling_viper_14_5,What? How can you say that?
d_counseling_viper_14_6,"I'd never kill you! You've been so nice to me. I'm not totally heartless, you know."
d_counseling_viper_14_7,Why would I waste my newfound freedom on killing you?
d_counseling_viper_14_8,"If anything, I guess I'd give you a choker."
d_counseling_viper_14_9,"One the same as mine, so you could wear it around your neck."
d_counseling_viper_14_10,Huh? That sounds more like something Crow would do.
d_counseling_viper_14_11,I'm a bit more low-key.
d_counseling_viper_14_12,Seeing people run about in a panic doesn't do much for me.
d_counseling_viper_14_13,I much prefer latching onto a single person and giving them my undivided attention.
d_counseling_viper_14_14,That's what gives me the most joy.
d_counseling_viper_14_15,I have a somewhat unnerving conversation with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_15_1,I am in a fantastic mood today!
d_counseling_viper_15_2,Wanna guess why?
d_counseling_viper_15_3,Because the weather is nice?
d_counseling_viper_15_4,Because today is our scheduled counseling day?
d_counseling_viper_15_5,Nope!
d_counseling_viper_15_6,I just had a killer deal go through without a hitch.
d_counseling_viper_15_7,"I sold some bombs to these little kids, and they didn't know any better, so I was able to pull a fast one on 'em!"
d_counseling_viper_15_8,"Oh, right! It'd be nice if we kept this whole arms deal thing on the down-low."
d_counseling_viper_15_9,"You won't tell anyone, will you?"
d_counseling_viper_15_10,"Wow, I hadn't even thought about that."
d_counseling_viper_15_11,"I was feeling good because these young kids I sold some bombs to didn't know their butts from a hole in the ground, and I made a killing."
d_counseling_viper_15_12,"But now that I think about it, I guess I am happy that I get to talk to you."
d_counseling_viper_15_13,"Oh, right! It'd be nice if we kept this whole arms deal thing on the down-low."
d_counseling_viper_15_14,"You won't tell anyone, will you?"
d_counseling_viper_15_15,I have a conversation with Viper about the things that make us happy.
d_counseling_viper_16_1,Do you believe that the feelings you have for other people
d_counseling_viper_16_2,are always reciprocated?
d_counseling_viper_16_3,I do.
d_counseling_viper_16_4,What do you think?
d_counseling_viper_16_5,You think so?
d_counseling_viper_16_6,Is that why you're so fond of other Nikkes?
d_counseling_viper_16_7,...
d_counseling_viper_16_8,"Oh, I didn't startle you, did I?"
d_counseling_viper_16_9,"Don't worry, I don't really care all that much."
d_counseling_viper_16_10,"Hey, are you answering my question with another question?"
d_counseling_viper_16_11,Well... I suppose I don't mind it too much.
d_counseling_viper_16_12,Viper throws her arms around my neck.
d_counseling_viper_16_13,"To answer your question, I'm not sure. So..."
d_counseling_viper_16_14,"How about you and I look into it, just the two of us?"
d_counseling_viper_16_15,I spend time with Viper finding out about love.
d_counseling_viper_17_1,Any chance you can end our session a little early today?
d_counseling_viper_17_2,I've got something to do.
d_counseling_viper_17_3,Okay.
d_counseling_viper_17_4,What is it?
d_counseling_viper_17_5,You're not even going to ask me what it is?
d_counseling_viper_17_6,Thanks for trusting me.
d_counseling_viper_17_7,"In that case, since our time together is short today, let's get a little closer."
d_counseling_viper_17_8,"If I told you, you'd stop me from doing it."
d_counseling_viper_17_9,"This is not a personal matter, so don't go all jealous on me."
d_counseling_viper_17_10,I have a short but rewarding session with Viper.
d_counseling_viper_18_1,Have I ever told you
d_counseling_viper_18_2,how innocent you are?
d_counseling_viper_18_3,... Is that a compliment?
d_counseling_viper_18_4,I'm not as innocent as you think I am.
d_counseling_viper_18_5,Of course it's a compliment!
d_counseling_viper_18_6,I love people who are nice and innocent like you.
d_counseling_viper_18_7,Don't ever change.
d_counseling_viper_18_8,"Haha, that's a good one!"
d_counseling_viper_18_9,"If you were a bad apple, then the Captain would really have egg on her face."
d_counseling_viper_18_10,"Having said that, if you ever want to take a walk on the wild side,"
d_counseling_viper_18_11,"feel free to get in touch with me, hehe!"
d_counseling_viper_18_12,I have a conversation with Viper about what makes a partner charming.
d_counseling_viper_19_1,"Honey, do you like alcohol?"
d_counseling_viper_19_2,I do.
d_counseling_viper_19_3,I don't.
d_counseling_viper_19_4,Cool.
d_counseling_viper_19_5,What about you?
d_counseling_viper_19_6,It's not so much that I like alcohol itself. It's just that...
d_counseling_viper_19_7,"If you drink with someone, you speak more freely and say what's on your mind."
d_counseling_viper_19_8,Viper grabs a bottle of alcohol from the refrigerator.
d_counseling_viper_19_9,How about we have a drink together?
d_counseling_viper_19_10,Not even a little bit?
d_counseling_viper_19_11,I'm not a teetotaler.
d_counseling_viper_19_12,"Whew, that's a relief!"
d_counseling_viper_19_13,Viper grabs a bottle of alcohol from the refrigerator.
d_counseling_viper_19_14,"In that case, how about we have a drink together?"
d_counseling_viper_19_15,I have an honest conversation with Viper while drinking.
d_counseling_viper_20_1,I'm not really in a good mood today.
d_counseling_viper_20_2,"My makeup didn't come out right, and my hair is a mess."
d_counseling_viper_20_3,I didn't expect you to care about stuff like that.
d_counseling_viper_20_4,We can always reschedule our session for another time.
d_counseling_viper_20_5,Of course. Physical attributes are useful in many ways.
d_counseling_viper_20_6,Everyone's a sucker for a pretty lady. I have an easier time persuading people.
d_counseling_viper_20_7,I wonder if that applies to you as well?
d_counseling_viper_20_8,"You really don't know how to take a hint, do you?"
d_counseling_viper_20_9,"If I didn't want to talk to you, then I wouldn't have come."
d_counseling_viper_20_10,I always feel a little better when I see you.
d_counseling_viper_20_11,I have a conversation with Viper about the powers of physical attributes.
d_counseling_jackal_01_1,Heya!
d_counseling_jackal_01_2,What do you want for lunch today?
d_counseling_jackal_01_3,I'm in the mood for meat.
d_counseling_jackal_01_4,Let's have beef-flavored Nutrium.
d_counseling_jackal_01_5,Let's have lamb-flavored Nutrium.
d_counseling_jackal_01_6,Be-beef flavored?
d_counseling_jackal_01_7,"You know I'm a fiend for beef,"
d_counseling_jackal_01_8,but I had that for dinner last night.
d_counseling_jackal_01_9,Lamb-flavored?
d_counseling_jackal_01_10,I've never tried it.
d_counseling_jackal_01_11,"As long as it's meat, I'm sure it'll be good."
d_counseling_jackal_01_12,"Let's get a move on, I'm starving!"
d_counseling_jackal_01_13,Jackal and I talk about the current meat flavors that are available.
d_counseling_jackal_02_1,Shooting guns is a blast!
d_counseling_jackal_02_2,When you pull that trigger and then... kablam!
d_counseling_jackal_02_3,Everything shatters into a million pieces! It's the coolest.
d_counseling_jackal_02_4,Just make sure you don't shoot at people.
d_counseling_jackal_02_5,It's rather reckless of you to fire so indiscriminately.
d_counseling_jackal_02_6,"Yeah, yeah, I know. The Captain already told me not to."
d_counseling_jackal_02_7,She explicitly forbade it.
d_counseling_jackal_02_8,"Unless she gives me a signal, that is."
d_counseling_jackal_02_9,"Aw c'mon, it's fun."
d_counseling_jackal_02_10,You don't want me to have fun?
d_counseling_jackal_02_11,I spend time with Jackal perusing through the latest gun catalogue.
d_counseling_jackal_03_1,Commander? My tooth hurts.
d_counseling_jackal_03_2,"This has never happened before, it's weird."
d_counseling_jackal_03_3,What? We better get you to the hospital right away.
d_counseling_jackal_03_4,"You didn't bite down on a stone by any chance, did you?"
d_counseling_jackal_03_5,!!
d_counseling_jackal_03_6,Absolutely not. I detest hospitals.
d_counseling_jackal_03_7,It's haunted by some ghost that walks around with its eyes closed. It freaks me out!
d_counseling_jackal_03_8,!!
d_counseling_jackal_03_9,"How did you know?! I was munching on some stones this morning, but it backfired on me."
d_counseling_jackal_03_10,You must be clairvoyant or something!
d_counseling_jackal_03_11,I lecture Jackal about the importance of proper dental hygiene.
d_counseling_jackal_04_1,"A couple of days ago at the store, I saw a necklace I really liked."
d_counseling_jackal_04_2,"I decided to take it with me, but the A.C.P.U. followed me."
d_counseling_jackal_04_3,What's the big deal? I was so scared I ended up having to run away.
d_counseling_jackal_04_4,They went after you because stealing is illegal.
d_counseling_jackal_04_5,They just wanted to give you a hard time.
d_counseling_jackal_04_6,Stealing? What's that?
d_counseling_jackal_04_7,"... Oh, right."
d_counseling_jackal_04_8,I do seem to remember the Captain telling me not to take things I want from the store.
d_counseling_jackal_04_9,Ugh!
d_counseling_jackal_04_10,Why must those morons always pester me?
d_counseling_jackal_04_11,They're always busting my hump and trying to capture me!
d_counseling_jackal_04_12,I talk with Jackal about necklaces she likes.
d_counseling_jackal_05_1,The A.C.P.U. is the absolute worst!
d_counseling_jackal_05_2,"Whenever I run into them, they always give me a hard time."
d_counseling_jackal_05_3,What did I ever do to them?
d_counseling_jackal_05_4,It's impossible to be liked by everyone.
d_counseling_jackal_05_5,It's not entirely unreasonable for the police to feel the way they do about you.
d_counseling_jackal_05_6,!!
d_counseling_jackal_05_7,"Yeah, you're right. Besides, I don't like them either!"
d_counseling_jackal_05_8,Fine by me. We can just go on hating each other.
d_counseling_jackal_05_9,??
d_counseling_jackal_05_10,What does their being the police have to do with me?
d_counseling_jackal_05_11,I spend time listening to Jackal talk behind A.C.P.U's back.
d_counseling_jackal_06_1,Get this. I gave some dude a thrashing a while back.
d_counseling_jackal_06_2,"Today, I'm relaxing, minding my own business, and suddenly his brother comes up to me all in a huff."
d_counseling_jackal_06_3,Why's he so mad at me?
d_counseling_jackal_06_4,Imagine if Viper got beat up by someone.
d_counseling_jackal_06_5,Imagine if Crow got beat up by someone.
d_counseling_jackal_06_6,If Viper got beat up...
d_counseling_jackal_06_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_jackal_06_8,Then that's just how it is. Why would I get upset over that?
d_counseling_jackal_06_9,If the Captain got beat up...
d_counseling_jackal_06_10,I'd want to know who did it! Then I'd find them and...
d_counseling_jackal_06_11,"... Oh, so that's how that guy felt today."
d_counseling_jackal_06_12,"I begin to explain to Jackal how to enact revenge, then decide against it."
d_counseling_jackal_07_1,The Captain is so amazing. She knows everything.
d_counseling_jackal_07_2,"That's why she commands respect from everyone, including me."
d_counseling_jackal_07_3,What about me?
d_counseling_jackal_07_4,"You're pretty amazing yourself, Jackal."
d_counseling_jackal_07_5,"You're amazing too, Commander!"
d_counseling_jackal_07_6,"But between the two of you, I'd say the winner is..."
d_counseling_jackal_07_7,"... aw heck, I can't decide! Either way, you're both winners in my book."
d_counseling_jackal_07_8,As if!
d_counseling_jackal_07_9,People always say that I'm useless.
d_counseling_jackal_07_10,"Except Captain and Viper, of course, but everyone else says so."
d_counseling_jackal_07_11,I listen to Jackal as she showers compliments on Crow.
d_counseling_jackal_08_1,*chomp* *chomp*
d_counseling_jackal_08_2,"Hey, you want some of this?"
d_counseling_jackal_08_3,"I came by this yesterday, and it's not half bad."
d_counseling_jackal_08_4,"Sorry, I don't think my teeth are up to the task."
d_counseling_jackal_08_5,"Sure, but I'll melt it down first."
d_counseling_jackal_08_6,You sure?
d_counseling_jackal_08_7,"If so, then more for me!"
d_counseling_jackal_08_8,... You're really not eating?
d_counseling_jackal_08_9,!!
d_counseling_jackal_08_10,I wonder what it tastes like when it's melted...
d_counseling_jackal_08_11,I wanna try that too!
d_counseling_jackal_08_12,Jackal gives me more pointers on how to choose delicious dishes.
d_counseling_jackal_09_1,There's this giant wall that separates my neighborhood from the Ark.
d_counseling_jackal_09_2,"It's a real pain in the butt to move around, and it's next to impossible to jump over."
d_counseling_jackal_09_3,Got any bright ideas on how I can get around it?
d_counseling_jackal_09_4,Let's practice jumping over it.
d_counseling_jackal_09_5,I'll tear that wall down.
d_counseling_jackal_09_6,Good idea!
d_counseling_jackal_09_7,"Since we won't be able to get rid of the wall, I might as well try and learn to jump higher."
d_counseling_jackal_09_8,Hehe! I'm gonna start practicing straight away!
d_counseling_jackal_09_9,"Ha, you can't be serious!"
d_counseling_jackal_09_10,Not even the Captain could tear down such an imposing wall.
d_counseling_jackal_09_11,Jackal and I practice how to add some height to our jumps.
d_counseling_jackal_10_1,Nothing beats running around!
d_counseling_jackal_10_2,But Captain never lets me run around in the hideout.
d_counseling_jackal_10_3,Why doesn't she let me do what I want?
d_counseling_jackal_10_4,Probably because it makes a lot of noise.
d_counseling_jackal_10_5,The hideout is much too small for you to run around in.
d_counseling_jackal_10_6,Noise? What's wrong with noise?
d_counseling_jackal_10_7,I like noise!
d_counseling_jackal_10_8,That's why I run around in the first place!
d_counseling_jackal_10_9,!!
d_counseling_jackal_10_10,I guess you're right... our hideout isn't exactly a sprawling estate.
d_counseling_jackal_10_11,The Captain is so thoughtful! She always has my best interests in mind.
d_counseling_jackal_10_12,I run around with Jackal.
d_counseling_jackal_11_1,Cmndr. Lik cmdfn.
d_counseling_jackal_11_2,I can't understand a word she's saying when she's gnawing on something.
d_counseling_jackal_11_3,Cmndr?
d_counseling_jackal_11_4,"Still can't make out what you're saying, but... thanks?"
d_counseling_jackal_11_5,Think you could drop what you're holding in your mouth first?
d_counseling_jackal_11_6,Hehe! Hehehe!
d_counseling_jackal_11_7,"IUf Cmnder is hppy, I'm happy!"
d_counseling_jackal_11_8,Hehe! Hehehe!
d_counseling_jackal_11_9,*spit*
d_counseling_jackal_11_10,*thud*
d_counseling_jackal_11_11,It's a grenade!
d_counseling_jackal_11_12,The Captain told me to give this to you.
d_counseling_jackal_11_13,"Don't worry, the pin's still in it."
d_counseling_jackal_11_14,I teach Jackal how to use the message system.
d_counseling_jackal_12_1,Commander!
d_counseling_jackal_12_2,Pat me on the head!
d_counseling_jackal_12_3,10 times. No! 100 times!
d_counseling_jackal_12_4,You sure you won't get tired of it?
d_counseling_jackal_12_5,"How does 1,000 times sound?"
d_counseling_jackal_12_6,"Trust me, I'll be fine."
d_counseling_jackal_12_7,So pat away!
d_counseling_jackal_12_8,!!
d_counseling_jackal_12_9,I love it!
d_counseling_jackal_12_10,I spend time patting Jackal's head.
d_counseling_jackal_13_1,Apparently a jackal is a type of animal?
d_counseling_jackal_13_2,Why would they name me after an animal?
d_counseling_jackal_13_3,Because you like meat?
d_counseling_jackal_13_4,Because you're cute and cuddly?
d_counseling_jackal_13_5,"I am a dyed-in-the-wool carnivore, no doubt about that."
d_counseling_jackal_13_6,And animals like meat too...
d_counseling_jackal_13_7,So that's why I'm called Jackal! It all makes sense now!
d_counseling_jackal_13_8,Cute... and cuddly?
d_counseling_jackal_13_9,Is that supposed to be some kind of insult?
d_counseling_jackal_13_10,"You better watch yourself, or else I'm going to get mad."
d_counseling_jackal_13_11,Jackal and I watch a nature documentary about animal life.
d_counseling_jackal_14_1,I wanna pull a prank on the A.C.P.U.!
d_counseling_jackal_14_2,"They're always on my case, so it's time I gave them a taste of their own medicine."
d_counseling_jackal_14_3,Got any good prank ideas?
d_counseling_jackal_14_4,"Get on their nerves, then run away."
d_counseling_jackal_14_5,Just lay low and keep quiet.
d_counseling_jackal_14_6,...
d_counseling_jackal_14_7,You call that a prank? Sounds to me like that's just being immature.
d_counseling_jackal_14_8,!!
d_counseling_jackal_14_9,"That way, the A.C.P.U. won't have any reason to bother me!"
d_counseling_jackal_14_10,They won't even know what hit 'em!
d_counseling_jackal_14_11,I look up additional ideas for pranks.
d_counseling_jackal_15_1,Viper often goes to get her nails done.
d_counseling_jackal_15_2,They're always so shiny and pretty.
d_counseling_jackal_15_3,I want to try it too!
d_counseling_jackal_15_4,How about getting your teeth treated?
d_counseling_jackal_15_5,You want to get your nails done?
d_counseling_jackal_15_6,My teeth?
d_counseling_jackal_15_7,"Ooooh, then they'd be super shiny!"
d_counseling_jackal_15_8,That'd be awesome! I love it!
d_counseling_jackal_15_9,"Sure, why not?"
d_counseling_jackal_15_10,But wait a minute... that'd mean I'd have to walk around with my gloves off.
d_counseling_jackal_15_11,"On second thought, I don't want to."
d_counseling_jackal_15_12,I tell Jackal the importance of pampering oneself occasionally.
d_counseling_jackal_16_1,"I caught the guy who caused that commotion a couple days ago, but he keeps denying everything."
d_counseling_jackal_16_2,"All he does is keep repeating ""I don't know"" ad nauseum."
d_counseling_jackal_16_3,What should I do to make him fess up?
d_counseling_jackal_16_4,Ask him politely.
d_counseling_jackal_16_5,Maybe he really doesn't know anything.
d_counseling_jackal_16_6,Ask politely?
d_counseling_jackal_16_7,Why would I do that?
d_counseling_jackal_16_8,Wouldn't it be faster to just smack him around a bit?
d_counseling_jackal_16_9,Maybe.
d_counseling_jackal_16_10,"Actually, now that I think about it, he may not have as much to do with this as I originally thought."
d_counseling_jackal_16_11,I guess I'll release him. I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
d_counseling_jackal_16_12,Jackal and I read up on how to properly address a line of questioning.
d_counseling_jackal_17_1,"Commander.
Is money important?"
d_counseling_jackal_17_2,"Whenever I question anyone who's committed a crime,"
d_counseling_jackal_17_3,they say they did it because they needed money.
d_counseling_jackal_17_4,So I'm curious: is money really that important?
d_counseling_jackal_17_5,It's not that important.
d_counseling_jackal_17_6,It's incredibly important.
d_counseling_jackal_17_7,That's what I figured.
d_counseling_jackal_17_8,I know you use it to buy food and stuff like that.
d_counseling_jackal_17_9,But I don't see what the big deal about money is when you can just steal what you want.
d_counseling_jackal_17_10,So you agree with them?
d_counseling_jackal_17_11,"In that case, what's to stop you from stabbing us in the back and pawning off all our belongings?"
d_counseling_jackal_17_12,That's something a person who was mad about money would do.
d_counseling_jackal_17_13,I teach Jackal how to count money.
d_counseling_jackal_18_1,This necklace is digging into my neck.
d_counseling_jackal_18_2,I'm gonna take it off.
d_counseling_jackal_18_3,Won't that upset Crow?
d_counseling_jackal_18_4,Don't take it off. It looks good on you.
d_counseling_jackal_18_5,The Captain?
d_counseling_jackal_18_6,She's never gotten sore at me for something like that.
d_counseling_jackal_18_7,"Just to be safe though, I'll run it by her first."
d_counseling_jackal_18_8,You think so?
d_counseling_jackal_18_9,Hehehe!
d_counseling_jackal_18_10,I'll leave it on then.
d_counseling_jackal_18_11,Jackal and I look at more necklaces online for her to buy.
d_counseling_jackal_19_1,I dig our little neighborhood.
d_counseling_jackal_19_2,"I like it because there are a lot of places to run around, and a ton of things to break!"
d_counseling_jackal_19_3,I don't know why everyone else is so down on it.
d_counseling_jackal_19_4,They're just jealous.
d_counseling_jackal_19_5,Because this place is dangerous for ordinary people.
d_counseling_jackal_19_6,Jealous?
d_counseling_jackal_19_7,"I suppose you've got a point. The Ark is so small, and the A.C.P.U. is always on your case if you break anything."
d_counseling_jackal_19_8,I feel bad for people living in the Ark.
d_counseling_jackal_19_9,??
d_counseling_jackal_19_10,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_jackal_19_11,There's nothing dangerous at all about our neighborhood.
d_counseling_jackal_19_12,I listen to Jackal go on bragging about the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_jackal_20_1,The Captain is always reading a book or watching a movie.
d_counseling_jackal_20_2,"I don't get it. Books or movies don't fill your stomach, so what's the point?"
d_counseling_jackal_20_3,"They may not fill your stomach, but they can enrich your mind."
d_counseling_jackal_20_4,She probably thinks it makes her look cool.
d_counseling_jackal_20_5,It does what to your mind?
d_counseling_jackal_20_6,Enrich? What's that?
d_counseling_jackal_20_7,Are you saying the Captain actually eats those books and movies?
d_counseling_jackal_20_8,"Well, if you ask me,"
d_counseling_jackal_20_9,I'd say she's succeeded!
d_counseling_jackal_20_10,"I try to recommend books and movies to Jackal, but give up."
d_counseling_guilty_01_1,"Counselor, between me, Quency, and Sin..."
d_counseling_guilty_01_2,who do you think is the nicest?
d_counseling_guilty_01_3,You.
d_counseling_guilty_01_4,I think you're all pretty much the same.
d_counseling_guilty_01_5,Thanks!
d_counseling_guilty_01_6,Those other two are far too dangerous.
d_counseling_guilty_01_7,I knew that I was the nicest.
d_counseling_guilty_01_8,The same? But we're all so different.
d_counseling_guilty_01_9,Are you sure you thought it over properly before answering?
d_counseling_guilty_01_10,I talk with Guilty about what it means to be nice.
d_counseling_guilty_02_1,Nobody ever listens to me.
d_counseling_guilty_02_2,"No matter how much I protest my innocence, they keep insisting that I'm a criminal."
d_counseling_guilty_02_3,How can I get people to hear me out?
d_counseling_guilty_02_4,Talk louder.
d_counseling_guilty_02_5,Speak with more conviction.
d_counseling_guilty_02_6,But I already feel like I'm shouting at the top of my lungs.
d_counseling_guilty_02_7,How can I talk any louder than I already am?
d_counseling_guilty_02_8,"Are you even listening to me, Counselor?"
d_counseling_guilty_02_9,More conviction?
d_counseling_guilty_02_10,You mean like being more forceful?
d_counseling_guilty_02_11,I didn't say anything about using force...
d_counseling_guilty_02_12,Oh... I like it...
d_counseling_guilty_02_13,"You know just how I feel, Counselor."
d_counseling_guilty_02_14,I can use force to get people to listen to me.
d_counseling_guilty_02_15,I practice speaking with Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_03_1,"Counselor, can you hold my hand?"
d_counseling_guilty_03_2,I take Guilty's hand in mine.
d_counseling_guilty_03_3,Your hand feels so nice... just as I thought it would.
d_counseling_guilty_03_4,Guilty clenches onto my hand more tightly.
d_counseling_guilty_03_5,Grip even tighter.
d_counseling_guilty_03_6,Try to remove her hand.
d_counseling_guilty_03_7,!!!
d_counseling_guilty_03_8,It feels even nicer when you hold my hand tightly.
d_counseling_guilty_03_9,"Whenever we hold hands, I want you to hold it like this."
d_counseling_guilty_03_10,Why are you taking your hand away?
d_counseling_guilty_03_11,That only makes me want to hold it more tightly.
d_counseling_guilty_03_12,Guilty loosens her grip.
d_counseling_guilty_03_13,But I suppose I shouldn't do that... at least not yet.
d_counseling_guilty_03_14,I spend time with Guilty while holding hands.
d_counseling_guilty_04_1,Sin said that lying is a skill in itself.
d_counseling_guilty_04_2,But I don't like lying.
d_counseling_guilty_04_3,"Do you ever lie, Counselor?"
d_counseling_guilty_04_4,Never.
d_counseling_guilty_04_5,"Sometimes, and I'm pretty good at it."
d_counseling_guilty_04_6,... Really?
d_counseling_guilty_04_7,Why does it feel like you're lying to me right now then...
d_counseling_guilty_04_8,"I'm not, honestly."
d_counseling_guilty_04_9,... If you say so.
d_counseling_guilty_04_10,Why would you say that right after I mentioned how much I dislike lying?
d_counseling_guilty_04_11,It's precise because you detest lying that I had to tell the truth.
d_counseling_guilty_04_12,I suppose you have a point...
d_counseling_guilty_04_13,"You really are an honest person, Counselor."
d_counseling_guilty_04_14,I really like that about you.
d_counseling_guilty_04_15,I have a bittersweet consultation with Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_05_1,"Counselor, didn't you say I was rehabilitated?"
d_counseling_guilty_05_2,"If that's true, why am I still in these restraints?"
d_counseling_guilty_05_3,They're so annoying...
d_counseling_guilty_05_4,Remove her restraints for a moment.
d_counseling_guilty_05_5,Ignore her pleas.
d_counseling_guilty_05_6,*Beep*
d_counseling_guilty_05_7,"After pressing the release button, the restraints on Guilty's hand are unlocked."
d_counseling_guilty_05_8,Only my hands? I guess it's better than nothing...
d_counseling_guilty_05_9,...
d_counseling_guilty_05_10,"I thought you would release the restraints, but I guess not."
d_counseling_guilty_05_11,That's too bad...
d_counseling_guilty_05_12,I comfort the disappointed Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_06_1,"Counselor, why are you still having consultations with me?"
d_counseling_guilty_06_2,Didn't you say I was already rehabilitated?
d_counseling_guilty_06_3,I'm your Counselor. It's my duty to continue these consultations.
d_counseling_guilty_06_4,"I came because I wanted to spend time with you, that's all."
d_counseling_guilty_06_5,Is...
d_counseling_guilty_06_6,is that the only reason?
d_counseling_guilty_06_7,"So, if you weren't my Counselor, you wouldn't come to see me?"
d_counseling_guilty_06_8,That's so sad...
d_counseling_guilty_06_9,!!
d_counseling_guilty_06_10,Really? You came here to see me?
d_counseling_guilty_06_11,"That's so nice... I really look forward to seeing you as well, Counselor."
d_counseling_guilty_06_12,Guilty and I have an emotional consultation.
d_counseling_guilty_07_1,Someone once told me that
d_counseling_guilty_07_2,Nikkes also need hobbies.
d_counseling_guilty_07_3,"I wonder, what kind of hobby should I pursue?"
d_counseling_guilty_07_4,Going for a walk while holding hands?
d_counseling_guilty_07_5,Exercising to gain better control over your strength?
d_counseling_guilty_07_6,But whose hand would I be holding?
d_counseling_guilty_07_7,"Could it... be yours, Counselor?"
d_counseling_guilty_07_8,I nod my head.
d_counseling_guilty_07_9,That...
d_counseling_guilty_07_10,would be wonderful.
d_counseling_guilty_07_11,Exercising as a hobby?
d_counseling_guilty_07_12,"Counselor, actually..."
d_counseling_guilty_07_13,I don't like the sound of that...
d_counseling_guilty_07_14,I brainstorm other possible hobbies Guilty could take up.
d_counseling_guilty_08_1,"Whenever I'm with you Counselor, my mood just lifts."
d_counseling_guilty_08_2,"When are you the happiest, Counselor?"
d_counseling_guilty_08_3,When I'm alone.
d_counseling_guilty_08_4,When I'm with you.
d_counseling_guilty_08_5,Alone?
d_counseling_guilty_08_6,"Does that mean whenever you're with me, you feel bad?"
d_counseling_guilty_08_7,Not at all.
d_counseling_guilty_08_8,Okay... I thought for a moment my feelings weren't reciprocated.
d_counseling_guilty_08_9,All this is making me confused.
d_counseling_guilty_08_10,"You better stop pulling my leg, or I'm going to squeeze you as hard as I can."
d_counseling_guilty_08_11,"Counselor, you too...?"
d_counseling_guilty_08_12,I'm glad... I would have felt bad if I was the only one who felt the way I do.
d_counseling_guilty_08_13,"If you had said you don't feel the same way, I don't know what I would have done to you."
d_counseling_guilty_08_14,"Either way, I'm glad that's not the case."
d_counseling_guilty_08_15,I spend a somewhat hair-raising session with Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_09_1,"Counselor, what do you do when you're feeling overwhelmed?"
d_counseling_guilty_09_2,How do you get rid of stress?
d_counseling_guilty_09_3,I sleep.
d_counseling_guilty_09_4,I exercise.
d_counseling_guilty_09_5,Does sleeping help relieve stress for you?
d_counseling_guilty_09_6,That doesn't work for me.
d_counseling_guilty_09_7,"You're certainly a unique person, Counselor."
d_counseling_guilty_09_8,Exercise?
d_counseling_guilty_09_9,"Right, physical activity always helps get rid of stress."
d_counseling_guilty_09_10,"If only I could be free of these restraints, then I could move around freely."
d_counseling_guilty_09_11,I have a conversation with Guilty about relieving stress.
d_counseling_guilty_10_1,I haven't been getting any good sleep lately.
d_counseling_guilty_10_2,What should I do?
d_counseling_guilty_10_3,How about counting sheep?
d_counseling_guilty_10_4,Want me to hold your hand while you sleep?
d_counseling_guilty_10_5,Counting sheep?
d_counseling_guilty_10_6,What good would that do me?
d_counseling_guilty_10_7,I'd much rather you hold my hand...
d_counseling_guilty_10_8,That sounds nice...
d_counseling_guilty_10_9,"Then I'd be nice and warm, and I could fall asleep more easily."
d_counseling_guilty_10_10,Do you think you could do that for me now?
d_counseling_guilty_10_11,I hold Guilty's hand so she could get some sleep.
d_counseling_guilty_11_1,Sin always makes fun of me because I'm slow at texting.
d_counseling_guilty_11_2,"I always use voice-to-text, so I can't help that it's slow sometimes..."
d_counseling_guilty_11_3,You should try and learn to text faster.
d_counseling_guilty_11_4,Don't worry about Sin. She's in the wrong.
d_counseling_guilty_11_5,But how? I can't send them any faster than I already am.
d_counseling_guilty_11_6,Voice-to-text always moves at a snail's pace.
d_counseling_guilty_11_7,"You could at least have a little sympathy, Counselor."
d_counseling_guilty_11_8,That's what I was saying!
d_counseling_guilty_11_9,Sin wouldn't say that if she couldn't use her arms to text.
d_counseling_guilty_11_10,She's so mean...
d_counseling_guilty_11_11,I help Guilty practice how to send texts faster.
d_counseling_guilty_12_1,"Counselor, what do you think is worse?"
d_counseling_guilty_12_2,"Hurting someone physically, or hurting their feelings?"
d_counseling_guilty_12_3,Hurting someone physically.
d_counseling_guilty_12_4,Hurting someone's feelings.
d_counseling_guilty_12_5,But why? The body heals quickly enough after being injured.
d_counseling_guilty_12_6,I think hurting someone's feelings is way worse.
d_counseling_guilty_12_7,I agree.
d_counseling_guilty_12_8,People who hurt your feelings are the worst.
d_counseling_guilty_12_9,So many people out there will betray your trust.
d_counseling_guilty_12_10,"Whenever I see people like that,"
d_counseling_guilty_12_11,I just wanna grab them and squeeze...
d_counseling_guilty_12_12,I have a conversation with Guilty about the importance of feelings.
d_counseling_guilty_13_1,"About Sin and Quency,"
d_counseling_guilty_13_2,they are way more dangerous than me.
d_counseling_guilty_13_3,Why am I under more heavy restraints than they are?
d_counseling_guilty_13_4,Because being tied up is a look that really suits you.
d_counseling_guilty_13_5,Because the crimes you committed were more serious.
d_counseling_guilty_13_6,So the more restraints I have... the more attractive I am?
d_counseling_guilty_13_7,I don't understand what you're saying.
d_counseling_guilty_13_8,I wish you'd take this a little more seriously and quit joking around.
d_counseling_guilty_13_9,"So that means they think I'm more of a threat, right?"
d_counseling_guilty_13_10,Does that mean you think I'm more of a threat?
d_counseling_guilty_13_11,I nod my head.
d_counseling_guilty_13_12,"Hmm... not sure if any of this makes me feel any better, but okay..."
d_counseling_guilty_13_13,I listen to Guilty complain more about being tied up.
d_counseling_guilty_14_1,"When I first entered the Rehabilitation Center, all the other Nikkes came over and were sizing me up."
d_counseling_guilty_14_2,What do you think I did when that happened?
d_counseling_guilty_14_3,You ignored them.
d_counseling_guilty_14_4,You punched them out.
d_counseling_guilty_14_5,!!
d_counseling_guilty_14_6,You really do understand me... good.
d_counseling_guilty_14_7,That's right. I ignored them... at first.
d_counseling_guilty_14_8,Why would I do that?
d_counseling_guilty_14_9,You really must think I'm some kind of depraved criminal.
d_counseling_guilty_14_10,"I just ignored them, since it was our first time meeting and all."
d_counseling_guilty_14_11,"Okay, but what did you do later on?"
d_counseling_guilty_14_12,"Afterwards, I told them that if they were so interested, they should come in for a closer look."
d_counseling_guilty_14_13,Then I gave a biiiiig ol' squeeze.
d_counseling_guilty_14_14,To every last one of them.
d_counseling_guilty_14_15,... I better tell the rest of the Nikkes at the Outpost not to stare at Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_15_1,"Do you like hugging other people,"
d_counseling_guilty_15_2,or do you prefer being hugged?
d_counseling_guilty_15_3,I like giving hugs.
d_counseling_guilty_15_4,I like being hugged.
d_counseling_guilty_15_5,I see...
d_counseling_guilty_15_6,That makes two of us then.
d_counseling_guilty_15_7,So that's why you shied away from my hugs.
d_counseling_guilty_15_8,"It made me sad at the time, but at least now I understand why you did it."
d_counseling_guilty_15_9,You prefer being hugged?
d_counseling_guilty_15_10,Then why didn't you let me hug you?
d_counseling_guilty_15_11,I feel so sad now...
d_counseling_guilty_15_12,I comfort the saddened Guilty.
d_counseling_guilty_16_1,Counselor...
d_counseling_guilty_16_2,My hands...
d_counseling_guilty_16_3,Are you asking me to untie your hands?
d_counseling_guilty_16_4,Are you asking me to hold your hand?
d_counseling_guilty_16_5,!!
d_counseling_guilty_16_6,That's right! How did you know?
d_counseling_guilty_16_7,I was hoping you'd pick up on how uncomfortable my hands felt.
d_counseling_guilty_16_8,I'm glad that you noticed.
d_counseling_guilty_16_9,"Um, that's nice too I suppose, but..."
d_counseling_guilty_16_10,my hands feel really uncomfortable right now. Can't you untie them?
d_counseling_guilty_16_11,Just for a moment?
d_counseling_guilty_16_12,I untie Guilty's hands.
d_counseling_guilty_17_1,"Counselor,"
d_counseling_guilty_17_2,can you pass me the water bottle that's over there?
d_counseling_guilty_17_3,Pour some water into a glass and hand it over.
d_counseling_guilty_17_4,Put a straw in the water bottle.
d_counseling_guilty_17_5,Are you being mean on purpose? How am I supposed to drink this with my hands tied?
d_counseling_guilty_17_6,Do you enjoy seeing me suffer?
d_counseling_guilty_17_7,Could you please put in a straw?
d_counseling_guilty_17_8,!!!
d_counseling_guilty_17_9,No one ever put in a straw for me without me having to ask them to...
d_counseling_guilty_17_10,I'm touched...
d_counseling_guilty_17_11,I help Guilty drink the water comfortably.
d_counseling_guilty_18_1,...
d_counseling_guilty_18_2,Guilty is staring intently at a bottle of hand lotion on the table.
d_counseling_guilty_18_3,Counselor...
d_counseling_guilty_18_4,Is this some kind of cruel joke?
d_counseling_guilty_18_5,"Quency said my hands are restrained, so they must be dried and cracked."
d_counseling_guilty_18_6,So she left a bottle of hand lotion on the table to torment me with.
d_counseling_guilty_18_7,Relax. I'll put it on for you.
d_counseling_guilty_18_8,Maybe?
d_counseling_guilty_18_9,!!
d_counseling_guilty_18_10,I guess as long as you help me put it on...
d_counseling_guilty_18_11,...
d_counseling_guilty_18_12,I won't be too angry.
d_counseling_guilty_18_13,"Honestly, I didn't even realize how dry my hands were until I saw the lotion. But now that I see it, it's all I can think about."
d_counseling_guilty_18_14,It's... frustrating.
d_counseling_guilty_18_15,There's no way I can put it on myself...
d_counseling_guilty_18_16,I'll put it on for you.
d_counseling_guilty_18_17,I apply some hand lotion on Guilty's hands.
d_counseling_guilty_19_1,Can I tie you up? I can use a restraint strap like mine.
d_counseling_guilty_19_2,"Just once, pretty please?"
d_counseling_guilty_19_3,No.
d_counseling_guilty_19_4,Maybe next time... if we have a chance.
d_counseling_guilty_19_5,"Jeez, you didn't have to be so blunt..."
d_counseling_guilty_19_6,Why are you so mean? Especially when I'm tied up like this...
d_counseling_guilty_19_7,I can't even do the same to you. It's not fair.
d_counseling_guilty_19_8,"It's okay. Even if you say no now,"
d_counseling_guilty_19_9,I'll try it one day.
d_counseling_guilty_19_10,!!
d_counseling_guilty_19_11,Really?
d_counseling_guilty_19_12,"Remember, you promised!"
d_counseling_guilty_19_13,No takebacks.
d_counseling_guilty_19_14,Guilty and I talk about restraint methods.
d_counseling_guilty_20_1,Sin brought me a mint chocolate soda.
d_counseling_guilty_20_2,She said the color suited me.
d_counseling_guilty_20_3,Apparently it's all the rage in the Ark at the moment.
d_counseling_guilty_20_4,Is there any truth to that?
d_counseling_guilty_20_5,"Yeah, it's delicious."
d_counseling_guilty_20_6,"No. Whatever you do, don't drink it."
d_counseling_guilty_20_7,"Okay, I was curious."
d_counseling_guilty_20_8,I'll try it then...
d_counseling_guilty_20_9,It's delicious!
d_counseling_guilty_20_10,Don't drink it?
d_counseling_guilty_20_11,"Oh, so I should stay away from it?"
d_counseling_guilty_20_12,...
d_counseling_guilty_20_13,"I'm still curious,"
d_counseling_guilty_20_14,so I'm going to try it anyway.
d_counseling_guilty_20_15,Guilty begins to drink the mint chocolate soda from a straw.
d_counseling_guilty_20_16,*Slurp*
d_counseling_guilty_20_17,!!
d_counseling_guilty_20_18,Hm...?
d_counseling_guilty_20_19,It's sweet... refreshing... bitter... and tangy...
d_counseling_guilty_20_20,Very interesting flavor. I... think I like it?
d_counseling_guilty_20_21,Guilty proceeds to finish the rest of the soda. It seems she enjoys it.
d_counseling_quency_01_1,Counselor.
d_counseling_quency_01_2,"If you and I went on a date in the Ark,"
d_counseling_quency_01_3,what would you want to do?
d_counseling_quency_01_4,Take a walk while picking up bottle caps.
d_counseling_quency_01_5,Watch a movie.
d_counseling_quency_01_6,"Oooh, such a unique date idea!"
d_counseling_quency_01_7,"If it were together with you, I suppose it'd be fun."
d_counseling_quency_01_8,Then we'd have to go to a movie theater...
d_counseling_quency_01_9,I'm not a fan of enclosed spaces.
d_counseling_quency_01_10,Quency and I have a pleasurable time speaking with one another.
d_counseling_quency_02_1,Counselor!
d_counseling_quency_02_2,What would you do if you were trapped in an endless maze?
d_counseling_quency_02_3,I'd ask you to come save me.
d_counseling_quency_02_4,I'd pick a spot and not move from there.
d_counseling_quency_02_5,You would?
d_counseling_quency_02_6,Plucking you out of a maze would be easy as pie for me.
d_counseling_quency_02_7,"I'd get you out of there, no problem."
d_counseling_quency_02_8,What would you do if no one went looking for you though?
d_counseling_quency_02_9,... I guess I could come save you if you wanted.
d_counseling_quency_02_10,Quency and I talk more about mazes.
d_counseling_quency_03_1,...
d_counseling_quency_03_2,Quency is nowhere to be seen.
d_counseling_quency_03_3,"Boo! Hehe, did I scare you?"
d_counseling_quency_03_4,Pretend to be scared.
d_counseling_quency_03_5,"Sorry, you didn't get me."
d_counseling_quency_03_6,"Oh jeez, are you okay?"
d_counseling_quency_03_7,I didn't think you'd scare that easily.
d_counseling_quency_03_8,"You're a bit of a scaredy-cat, aren't you?"
d_counseling_quency_03_9,You can't fool me! I saw you jump.
d_counseling_quency_03_10,You were scared.
d_counseling_quency_03_11,Quency and I have a pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_04_1,"Counselor, if I ever leave the Rehabilitation Center,"
d_counseling_quency_04_2,what's the first thing you'd want to do?
d_counseling_quency_04_3,I'd buy you some tofu.
d_counseling_quency_04_4,I'd buy you some light croquettes.
d_counseling_quency_04_5,Tofu?
d_counseling_quency_04_6,"Blech, I hate tofu."
d_counseling_quency_04_7,"Something else, please."
d_counseling_quency_04_8,That'd be awesome!
d_counseling_quency_04_9,We can eat it together.
d_counseling_quency_04_10,Quency and I have a pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_05_1,I wonder what it feels like to be free?
d_counseling_quency_05_2,Freedom is a concept that I can't even fully comprehend.
d_counseling_quency_05_3,Aren't you free right now?
d_counseling_quency_05_4,"If you were free, you could come see me whenever you wanted."
d_counseling_quency_05_5,"That's true, but I'm not completely free."
d_counseling_quency_05_6,I wonder if it's any different from what I have now?
d_counseling_quency_05_7,"Actually, I can do that now."
d_counseling_quency_05_8,"For example, I'm going to come see you again tomorrow."
d_counseling_quency_05_9,I speak with Quency about freedom.
d_counseling_quency_06_1,Counselor.
d_counseling_quency_06_2,Help me come up with a nickname.
d_counseling_quency_06_3,I need to use an alias when I'm doing business.
d_counseling_quency_06_4,The Escape Artist.
d_counseling_quency_06_5,Why not use your name? Quency is a fine name.
d_counseling_quency_06_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_quency_06_7,"It's okay, but nothing special. Got anything else?"
d_counseling_quency_06_8,Hehe. Really?
d_counseling_quency_06_9,"All right, I'll just use my real name then."
d_counseling_quency_06_10,I spend time with Quency coming up with nicknames.
d_counseling_quency_07_1,I'm thinking of creating a new escape route.
d_counseling_quency_07_2,What kind should I make?
d_counseling_quency_07_3,One that leads to my heart.
d_counseling_quency_07_4,Don't you think you already have enough escape routes as is?
d_counseling_quency_07_5,"Haha, I don't want to brag,"
d_counseling_quency_07_6,but I think I can get there easily enough already.
d_counseling_quency_07_7,"You never know when they'll find one of them and block it off. The more routes you have, the better."
d_counseling_quency_07_8,"Come on, this stuff is prison breaking 101!"
d_counseling_quency_07_9,Quency and I contemplate new potential escape routes.
d_counseling_quency_08_1,"Counselor,"
d_counseling_quency_08_2,feel like bartering?
d_counseling_quency_08_3,Got any good items on you?
d_counseling_quency_08_4,A limited-edition Ark Ranger figurine.
d_counseling_quency_08_5,An adult magazine.
d_counseling_quency_08_6,"Hmm, I'm not sure if that'd be a big hit in the Rehabilitation Center."
d_counseling_quency_08_7,"Then again, maybe I'll take it just in case."
d_counseling_quency_08_8,*Gasp* Really? I'll take it!
d_counseling_quency_08_9,That'll sell like hot cakes in the Rehabilitation Center.
d_counseling_quency_08_10,Wait a minute... why do you even have that in the first place?
d_counseling_quency_08_11,I spend time exchanging items with Quency.
d_counseling_quency_09_1,I have to ask.
d_counseling_quency_09_2,"Do you prefer Guilty, or Sin?"
d_counseling_quency_09_3,None of them can beat you.
d_counseling_quency_09_4,Let me think...
d_counseling_quency_09_5,"Hey, I was asking about those two, not me!"
d_counseling_quency_09_6,"Hehe, very smooth, Counselor."
d_counseling_quency_09_7,You're number one in my book as well.
d_counseling_quency_09_8,Do you really need to think that hard about it?
d_counseling_quency_09_9,I'm going to tell Guilty and Sin.
d_counseling_quency_09_10,"That is, unless you give me some bottle caps, then perhaps I'll be able to keep this between us."
d_counseling_quency_09_11,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_10_1,Counseling me must be a real challenge for you.
d_counseling_quency_10_2,Especially since I disappear pretty much on a daily basis.
d_counseling_quency_10_3,"If I'm being honest, it can be trying."
d_counseling_quency_10_4,It's not hard at all.
d_counseling_quency_10_5,!!
d_counseling_quency_10_6,Is it really?
d_counseling_quency_10_7,Hmm... I didn't expect you to be so candid.
d_counseling_quency_10_8,"Hehe, that's good then!"
d_counseling_quency_10_9,"I don't know if I've ever told you, but I really do enjoy our sessions together."
d_counseling_quency_10_10,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_11_1,I'm curious.
d_counseling_quency_11_2,"What's the perfect woman, in your mind?"
d_counseling_quency_11_3,"Someone bright and bubbly, like you."
d_counseling_quency_11_4,My lips are sealed.
d_counseling_quency_11_5,Do you really mean it?
d_counseling_quency_11_6,I asked that question because I was hoping that'd be your answer.
d_counseling_quency_11_7,"As for me, you're very much my type as well."
d_counseling_quency_11_8,"Aw, c'mon! That only makes me more curious!"
d_counseling_quency_11_9,Can't you at least give me a hint? Just one word.
d_counseling_quency_11_10,I spend time with Quency talking about what we value in a partner.
d_counseling_quency_12_1,"Just because I've always got a smile on my face,"
d_counseling_quency_12_2,people think they can take advantage of me.
d_counseling_quency_12_3,Start walking around looking scary.
d_counseling_quency_12_4,"In the end, the person who is smiling is the real winner."
d_counseling_quency_12_5,I've considered that before.
d_counseling_quency_12_6,But I think it'd end up negatively affecting my mood.
d_counseling_quency_12_7,"You're right,"
d_counseling_quency_12_8,but I just get so peeved sometimes.
d_counseling_quency_12_9,"Then again, whoever is smiling in the end is the true victor."
d_counseling_quency_12_10,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_13_1,Hm...
d_counseling_quency_13_2,What's your stance on hardened criminals?
d_counseling_quency_13_3,I don't have an opinion.
d_counseling_quency_13_4,They scare me.
d_counseling_quency_13_5,You don't?
d_counseling_quency_13_6,You don't seem to have many preconceptions about other people.
d_counseling_quency_13_7,That's a relief. I thought you might be afraid of them right from the jump.
d_counseling_quency_13_8,They do?
d_counseling_quency_13_9,So... do you find me scary as well?
d_counseling_quency_13_10,Quency and I talk more about hardened criminals.
d_counseling_quency_14_1,I've been wondering.
d_counseling_quency_14_2,What was your first impression of me?
d_counseling_quency_14_3,You seemed like you'd pose quite the challenge.
d_counseling_quency_14_4,I thought you were pretty.
d_counseling_quency_14_5,A challenge? How so?
d_counseling_quency_14_6,You mean it wouldn't be easy to win me over?
d_counseling_quency_14_7,Really?
d_counseling_quency_14_8,I thought you were pretty good-looking too.
d_counseling_quency_14_9,I talk about first impressions with Quency.
d_counseling_quency_15_1,Apparently mint chocolate is all the rage in the Ark.
d_counseling_quency_15_2,Have you tried it?
d_counseling_quency_15_3,Heck no. Sounds like it'd taste like toothpaste.
d_counseling_quency_15_4,"I've been trying to get my hands on some, but it's always sold out."
d_counseling_quency_15_5,I don't understand it myself either.
d_counseling_quency_15_6,"Since it's popular, I thought about selling it at the Rehabilitation Center, but I'm not sure if it'll be a big seller."
d_counseling_quency_15_7,"Yikes, is it really that bad?"
d_counseling_quency_15_8,Certainly doesn't sound appetizing.
d_counseling_quency_15_9,Should I try selling it at the Rehabilitation Center?
d_counseling_quency_15_10,Quency and I converse a little more about supply and demand.
d_counseling_quency_16_1,"Hey, Counselor."
d_counseling_quency_16_2,Do you have a girlfriend?
d_counseling_quency_16_3,I just thought it would be good to know.
d_counseling_quency_16_4,I don't.
d_counseling_quency_16_5,I do.
d_counseling_quency_16_6,"Phew, that's a relief!"
d_counseling_quency_16_7,I thought you did.
d_counseling_quency_16_8,Liar!
d_counseling_quency_16_9,"... You're not lying to me, are you?"
d_counseling_quency_16_10,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_17_1,Counselor.
d_counseling_quency_17_2,Counselor! Counselor? Couuunnseellooorrrr!
d_counseling_quency_17_3,WHAT?!
d_counseling_quency_17_4,Quency! Quency? Quuiinncccyyyy!
d_counseling_quency_17_5,I was just trying to get your attention.
d_counseling_quency_17_6,You don't have to get nasty.
d_counseling_quency_17_7,Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
d_counseling_quency_17_8,"Hehe, very funny."
d_counseling_quency_17_9,"That's why I like you, Counselor. You've got a sense of humor."
d_counseling_quency_17_10,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_quency_18_1,I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep for the past few days.
d_counseling_quency_18_2,Beats me as to why. It's not like anything has been weighing on my mind.
d_counseling_quency_18_3,We can try sleeping alongside each other.
d_counseling_quency_18_4,Try counting sheep.
d_counseling_quency_18_5,!!
d_counseling_quency_18_6,"You're not pulling my leg, are you?"
d_counseling_quency_18_7,"In that case, I'll come to your room later tonight."
d_counseling_quency_18_8,Already tried it.
d_counseling_quency_18_9,One sheep... Two sheep...
d_counseling_quency_18_10,Ugh! So boring.
d_counseling_quency_18_11,Quency and I talk a little more about sleep.
d_counseling_quency_19_1,"Counselor,"
d_counseling_quency_19_2,do you have any nicknames?
d_counseling_quency_19_3,"If you do, I'll call you that once I leave the Rehabilitation Center."
d_counseling_quency_19_4,Baby.
d_counseling_quency_19_5,{AccountData.NickName}.
d_counseling_quency_19_6,Baby? Okay!
d_counseling_quency_19_7,That's what I'll call you once I'm out of here.
d_counseling_quency_19_8,{AccountData.NickName}?
d_counseling_quency_19_9,Nice! It feels like we've gotten closer to each other.
d_counseling_quency_19_10,I discuss more nicknames with Quency.
d_counseling_quency_20_1,"If the day comes when you start living up on the surface,"
d_counseling_quency_20_2,what will become of me?
d_counseling_quency_20_3,You'd be in a Rehabilitation Center up on the surface.
d_counseling_quency_20_4,"You'd be right there with me, roaming freely up on the surface."
d_counseling_quency_20_5,"*Gasp* You're not serious, are you?"
d_counseling_quency_20_6,"If that's a joke, it's not funny."
d_counseling_quency_20_7,You think so?
d_counseling_quency_20_8,I wonder what it would feel like living up on the surface.
d_counseling_quency_20_9,"Whatever it would be like, I hope I get to experience it soon."
d_counseling_quency_20_10,Quency and I have another pleasant session.
d_counseling_sin_01_1,"▣□Is this really※necessary, Coun□selor?"
d_counseling_sin_01_2,I'm just□▣an ordinary※citizen※who has been rehabilitated.
d_counseling_sin_01_3,Why do you▣▣ insist on putting▣▣ this converter on me?
d_counseling_sin_01_4,Because you are still on probation.
d_counseling_sin_01_5,Because I'm not confident that I can restrain you if I have to.
d_counseling_sin_01_6,"Be that as it ▣※may, am I not
□□entitled to my rights?※□ You can let me free and see how I do."
d_counseling_sin_01_7,□▣▣This is※▣absurd. I'm deducting you 10 points.
d_counseling_sin_01_8,※▣□Why would you ever need to※▣□restrain me?
d_counseling_sin_01_9,Are you sure this isn't▣□some sick fantasy※of yours?
d_counseling_sin_01_10,Sin and I fight about whether or not she should take off her converter.
d_counseling_sin_02_1,※□□Counselor! I think I'm starting to▣※get used※□ to this place.
d_counseling_sin_02_2,"▣I had so much fun cutting□□ it up with the Nikkes here yesterday, I had※▣tears coming down my face."
d_counseling_sin_02_3,So that kerfuffle last night was your doing.
d_counseling_sin_02_4,I'm glad to hear that you've managed to adjust.
d_counseling_sin_02_5,"What do you mean※□※kerfuffle?
Don't you think you're being a tad bit※▣negative?"
d_counseling_sin_02_6,"Personally, I'd call it ※□more of a team-building experience, or a work□▣shop."
d_counseling_sin_02_7,"Yeah, everyone here is※▣so nice."
d_counseling_sin_02_8,"There's always a few rotten eggs who▣※※ act like bullies,
□▣but other than that, this place※□※feels like home now."
d_counseling_sin_02_9,I think ※※bullying should□▣be outlawed!
d_counseling_sin_02_10,Sin and I talk about what it's like to cohabitate with others.
d_counseling_sin_03_1,Coun▣□selor.
d_counseling_sin_03_2,"If you rescued a ※※kid who was about to drown
▣▣※and they said afterwards that they wanted some Nutrium□, what would you do?"
d_counseling_sin_03_3,I'd probably buy them some.
d_counseling_sin_03_4,What makes you ask such a random question?
d_counseling_sin_03_5,"You're a good person,※▣ so I'm not surprised▣□to hear you※say that."
d_counseling_sin_03_6,□□I'm just▣※curious about your personality.
d_counseling_sin_03_7,No※▣other reason.
d_counseling_sin_03_8,"Personally, I'd buy the kid whatever they wanted."
d_counseling_sin_03_9,I□※※see.
d_counseling_sin_03_10,▣※Then how about※※a Nikke who almost drowned?
d_counseling_sin_03_11,"※※□And▣what if it wasn't drowning, □※but being locked up in the Rehabilitation Center?"
d_counseling_sin_03_12,"If you ask me,▣▣※I feel worse for those Nikkes.
□□They're the ones who are most put upon by※society."
d_counseling_sin_03_13,I promise Sin that I'll buy her some Nutrium soon.
d_counseling_sin_04_1,※※Let's▣see...
d_counseling_sin_04_2,"□※S is standing pretty at 30 points, R is at minus 6□▣points, E is..."
d_counseling_sin_04_3,Are you calculating points?
d_counseling_sin_04_4,What does S and R stand for?
d_counseling_sin_04_5,※□Yup.
d_counseling_sin_04_6,□※These are points all earned by risking their▣▣□lives.
d_counseling_sin_04_7,"If I don't※▣※record it in detail, 
there might be□□a riot..."
d_counseling_sin_04_8,They're the names of some▣※□Nikkes here.
d_counseling_sin_04_9,"The inmates here※▣aren't assigned numbers□※, so
I'm using initials※▣□ instead."
d_counseling_sin_04_10,I watch Sin allotting points to various Nikkes.
d_counseling_sin_05_1,"□※▣Counselor, you get along with □the other Nikkes※like a house on fire."
d_counseling_sin_05_2,Everyone▣can't stop□□complimenting you.※▣※
d_counseling_sin_05_3,How does that make you feel?
d_counseling_sin_05_4,"Trust me, I'm far from perfect."
d_counseling_sin_05_5,...※Me※?
d_counseling_sin_05_6,As if you had to □▣ask.
d_counseling_sin_05_7,※▣I came here with my bags packed※because I was□ looking for you.
d_counseling_sin_05_8,"Oh come now□※□, there's no need to▣ be humble."
d_counseling_sin_05_9,▣▣It doesn't leave any room for a Nikke ※to□take care of you...
d_counseling_sin_05_10,"Sin, who seems to be in a good mood, awards me points."
d_counseling_sin_06_1,※□What would※ you think of me doing some▣※community service?
d_counseling_sin_06_2,"Ever since I was released□※from the Rehabilitation Center ▣※, I've been wanting to do something that has meaning."
d_counseling_sin_06_3,"Okay, let's go together during the weekend."
d_counseling_sin_06_4,"...You're not up to anything, are you?"
d_counseling_sin_06_5,Woohoo□※□! Thanks!
d_counseling_sin_06_6,This way※I can connect with ※▣people who are※going through▣a rough patch.
d_counseling_sin_06_7,I'm sure it'll be fun and▣※※fulfilling in equal measure.
d_counseling_sin_06_8,※▣▣What? Not※□ at all!
d_counseling_sin_06_9,Just because you have a criminal history doesn't□※mean you can't change...※※
d_counseling_sin_06_10,What kind of monster▣▣would abuse community service□for their own nefarious means?
d_counseling_sin_06_11,Sin and I look more into what community service we can do.
d_counseling_sin_07_1,"※▣□Wasn't last week fun※※, Counselor?"
d_counseling_sin_07_2,"□※Every time I think back on ▣※□what you did, 
I bust out※□laughing."
d_counseling_sin_07_3,I don't remember.
d_counseling_sin_07_4,"Last week? Wait, you mean when I...?!"
d_counseling_sin_07_5,"You're pulling my leg, ▣aren't※you?"
d_counseling_sin_07_6,▣□▣You said you thought▣it was unfair that I※ was the only one wearing a converter.
d_counseling_sin_07_7,"So you paraded around※the Outpost□※with a garbage bag over your head ▣※.
Don't tell me you※※don't remember!"
d_counseling_sin_07_8,... I don't. Really.
d_counseling_sin_07_9,"Well, in that case, there's only one thing we can do."
d_counseling_sin_07_10,□Gather everyone□※▣together and do it one more time!
d_counseling_sin_07_11,▣□▣You said you thought▣it was unfair that I※ was the only one wearing a converter.
d_counseling_sin_07_12,"So you paraded around※the Outpost□※with a phone case taped to your mouth ▣※
Don't tell you※※don't remember!"
d_counseling_sin_07_13,I talk about my embarrassing actions a few days prior.
d_counseling_sin_08_1,□※▣Quency has been※※coming here often.
d_counseling_sin_08_2,"※※I don't mind□it, but security▣here is□ so lax."
d_counseling_sin_08_3,Quency never was one to follow the rules.
d_counseling_sin_08_4,Let me know the next time you see Quency.
d_counseling_sin_08_5,That's▣※□true.
d_counseling_sin_08_6,"▣※※Thanks to her□※,I can ask about how everyone is doing in the center□."
d_counseling_sin_08_7,Huh※□? Why would I do that?
d_counseling_sin_08_8,"▣▣※We inmates need to have each other's back,□※whether we're in or outside of the center."
d_counseling_sin_08_9,"If I ratted out※□ every person□I encountered that annoyed me,
who'd want to live□▣ in a world filled with such pettiness?"
d_counseling_sin_08_10,I listen to Sin as she tells me about a fellow patient during her time at the center.
d_counseling_sin_09_1,□※※Is this whole counseling thing really necessary □▣?
d_counseling_sin_09_2,I've already been□□rehabilitated.
d_counseling_sin_09_3,"For your own mental health, it's absolutely necessary."
d_counseling_sin_09_4,Should we do something else then?
d_counseling_sin_09_5,"※□Jeez, I didn't think you were such a※□square."
d_counseling_sin_09_6,"▣Hardly what I'd▣※call hip and happenin'※□.
15 points penalty!"
d_counseling_sin_09_7,□▣Like what※?
d_counseling_sin_09_8,Anything you want.
d_counseling_sin_09_9,...
d_counseling_sin_09_10,□□Hmm... how about you take this converter off※□and we do a little tongue wrestling?
d_counseling_sin_09_11,"Sorry, no dice."
d_counseling_sin_09_12,Sin and I spend the rest of our session in silence.
d_counseling_sin_10_1,□※▣I think everyone ※※needs to take a walk on the wild side※at least once in their life▣.
d_counseling_sin_10_2,"□▣If you could commit one sin,▣※what would it be?"
d_counseling_sin_10_3,Whichever is the least severe.
d_counseling_sin_10_4,Offer a live sacrifice to appease the gods.
d_counseling_sin_10_5,...
d_counseling_sin_10_6,You're□※ more of a wuss than I thought▣※□.
d_counseling_sin_10_7,▣※※Someone like you who wants to achieve  ▣□great things should be willing to※□ dabble in the sinful side of life.
d_counseling_sin_10_8,□▣Wow!
d_counseling_sin_10_9,※□I admire your※brutality.
d_counseling_sin_10_10,I feel like※▣□we're kindred spirits. ▣※ 50 points for you!
d_counseling_sin_10_11,I speak with Sin about the ethics of sin.
d_counseling_sin_11_1,▣Counselor※.
d_counseling_sin_11_2,"※▣Would you prefer to be given a ▣※ bar of Splendamin, or a ▣※□light croquette?"
d_counseling_sin_11_3,Splendamin.
d_counseling_sin_11_4,Croquette.
d_counseling_sin_11_5,Good choice. Isn't Splendamin the best?
d_counseling_sin_11_6,"Especially ▣※the chocolate-flavored ones.▣※ They're the tastiest, ※and□ the hardest to□ find▣※."
d_counseling_sin_11_7,"□※※If I want to become close▣to someone□, I should give them a bar of Splendamin▣※."
d_counseling_sin_11_8,Cro※quette?
d_counseling_sin_11_9,Quency※※said※she prefers※ croquette to※▣□Splendamin as well...
d_counseling_sin_11_10,▣▣※Is this some kind of croquette▣※conspiracy□?
d_counseling_sin_11_11,Sin and I continue to discuss all things food-related.
d_counseling_sin_12_1,"It's not□※※that▣today's session isn't enjoyable▣□, but"
d_counseling_sin_12_2,※I'm▣□▣bored out of my gourd.
d_counseling_sin_12_3,Is there something else you'd rather be doing?
d_counseling_sin_12_4,Should I give you a piggyback ride?
d_counseling_sin_12_5,※□Nothing in※particular.
d_counseling_sin_12_6,"▣□▣□It feels like something's... □※missing.※▣※▣I just feel bored, that's all."
d_counseling_sin_12_7,▣▣You don't▣need to worry※.
d_counseling_sin_12_8,You'd※really□do that?
d_counseling_sin_12_9,▣□▣I knew□□you're□※□▣a good□person!
d_counseling_sin_12_10,You □※sure you'll be okay? I'm awfully heavy.□▣※
d_counseling_sin_12_11,I make an effort to make sure Sin was not bored during our session.
d_counseling_sin_13_1,※▣There's a□▣□saying that people take※▣advantage of those who are too nice.
d_counseling_sin_13_2,※Do you※▣think▣※□that's true?
d_counseling_sin_13_3,There's also a saying that luck will find those who live kindly.
d_counseling_sin_13_4,I agree somewhat.
d_counseling_sin_13_5,※▣Do you※□really▣believe▣that?
d_counseling_sin_13_6,"▣□I can't agree. ※□Once I left the▣▣Rehabilitation Center,"
d_counseling_sin_13_7,※▣□more than a few people▣tried to take advantage of my▣kindness.
d_counseling_sin_13_8,▣※□I feel▣the same way□□.
d_counseling_sin_13_9,※No※body□ever takes me seriously□※because I'm▣□▣too nice!
d_counseling_sin_13_10,※People who live well※tend to be▣□on the nicer side.
d_counseling_sin_13_11,※▣But▣□even they will※have※a bad side to them.
d_counseling_sin_13_12,"▣So it's okay※▣to be a bit bad,□※□ don't you think▣?"
d_counseling_sin_13_13,I talk about good and evil with Sin.
d_counseling_sin_14_1,"▣※Counselor,▣□▣who□is the Nikke you're closest to?"
d_counseling_sin_14_2,※▣From what I□hear※▣you're close to□everyone.
d_counseling_sin_14_3,... You?
d_counseling_sin_14_4,I get along with everyone.
d_counseling_sin_14_5,Re※▣ally?
d_counseling_sin_14_6,"※I'd say you're my closest friend as well, ※▣right after□Guilty□and Quency※."
d_counseling_sin_14_7,Does□※that make※us□※best▣□friends?
d_counseling_sin_14_8,▣I figured▣※□as much□.
d_counseling_sin_14_9,▣So※▣there's no□▣Nikke□you'd say you're closest to?
d_counseling_sin_14_10,Th※▣※en we should□▣become※▣ closer.
d_counseling_sin_14_11,My friendship with Sin deepens.
d_counseling_sin_15_1,□It would be▣※※※great if we could have□counseling sessions via text.
d_counseling_sin_15_2,□▣Then▣※I wouldn't feel□misunderstood▣※※.
d_counseling_sin_15_3,I like it when I can see your face.
d_counseling_sin_15_4,Would you like to have our next session over text?
d_counseling_sin_15_5,Ye□▣ah?
d_counseling_sin_15_6,▣▣▣...
d_counseling_sin_15_7,Then ▣let's just※□keep things as they are□▣.
d_counseling_sin_15_8,"□※□□Now that ※□I've given it some more thought,▣▣I guess this is fine."
d_counseling_sin_15_9,"Hmm...▣▣ Nah,▣※never mind."
d_counseling_sin_15_10,※※With text□▣※you can't really tell how the□other person is feeling.
d_counseling_sin_15_11,"I think□※▣that would lead to just as※※much miscommunication, if not more!"
d_counseling_sin_15_12,Sin and I discuss different potential counseling methods.
d_counseling_sin_16_1,"Counselor□※▣,"
d_counseling_sin_16_2,"※□do you prefer having a▣▣few close friends,"
d_counseling_sin_16_3,Or a wide circle※□of acquaintances▣▣?
d_counseling_sin_16_4,A few close friends.
d_counseling_sin_16_5,A wide circle of acquaintances.
d_counseling_sin_16_6,"□□Closer relationships▣▣can be much more□□rewarding,"
d_counseling_sin_16_7,"▣but if they fall apart,※it's hard※to put them back※together again."
d_counseling_sin_16_8,"The more you trust someone, the□□ more you feel※□betrayed※if the relationship goes south."
d_counseling_sin_16_9,▣So※I'm a bit reluctant to have deep connections with pe▣ople I know.
d_counseling_sin_16_10,"I much prefer having▣a wide social circle※□of people I know, but aren't necessarily overly▣ familiar with."
d_counseling_sin_16_11,"□□When it▣comes to helping※someone※□,"
d_counseling_sin_16_12,"you're ▣much more inclined to help someone ※□you know versus, say, a complete stranger※."
d_counseling_sin_16_13,Sin and I debate about relationships.
d_counseling_sin_17_1,▣□▣How can I※▣form a meaningful connection with□□someone□▣?
d_counseling_sin_17_2,"※□Maybe it's□▣because I came※□out from the rehabilitation□▣center,"
d_counseling_sin_17_3,▣□▣but it feels like everyone※□is always▣judging me▣.
d_counseling_sin_17_4,"If you want to get close to someone, just talk to them."
d_counseling_sin_17_5,Butter them up first with a bar of Splendamin.
d_counseling_sin_17_6,※▣Are you□※※sure about that※?
d_counseling_sin_17_7,"▣□▣□Whenever I talk to※them※,"
d_counseling_sin_17_8,▣※□□everyone starts ▣□avoiding me before long□※.
d_counseling_sin_17_9,□□Is that really all it takes□to□▣※win people over?
d_counseling_sin_17_10,"If※that's how□▣※it is,"
d_counseling_sin_17_11,▣□▣I'll prepare□□some handmade chocolate※Splendamin※.
d_counseling_sin_17_12,Sin and I brainstorm about other ways to win people over.
d_counseling_sin_18_1,▣Guilty ▣is※□□upset with me.
d_counseling_sin_18_2,▣I made▣fun of her▣and said that she□※texts too slow.
d_counseling_sin_18_3,How▣▣can I□※get her□▣※to not be mad at me anymore?
d_counseling_sin_18_4,Nothing you can do. Just have to wait until she cools off.
d_counseling_sin_18_5,Look her straight in the eye and apologize.
d_counseling_sin_18_6,□※ That's exactly※▣ what I was planning on▣▣doing!
d_counseling_sin_18_7,"※▣If I just sit back and wait ▣,I won't※exacerbate the situation□※."
d_counseling_sin_18_8,▣I'm sure※▣ she'll be※▣fine once some time passes.
d_counseling_sin_18_9,"※If I show myself in front of※Guilty▣▣right now,"
d_counseling_sin_18_10,She may try and break□※every bone□※in my body.
d_counseling_sin_18_11,▣I'll just※wait▣until※※she feels better~!
d_counseling_sin_18_12,I speak with Sin about Guilty.
d_counseling_sin_19_1,▣※□It's so▣▣annoying having to※□blend up all of my meals.
d_counseling_sin_19_2,□※※What▣should I▣do※▣?
d_counseling_sin_19_3,※▣I can't▣starve□※※because of▣this.
d_counseling_sin_19_4,"※□Quency▣is too busy, □※※so I don't want to bother her, and Guilty※could crush me like a bug▣if I rub her the wrong way."
d_counseling_sin_19_5,I'll blend your food up for you.
d_counseling_sin_19_6,"If you starve yourself long enough, you'll be more than willing to blend your food."
d_counseling_sin_19_7,You'd do□▣that for me? I felt※※a little bad※□※asking.
d_counseling_sin_19_8,"But if※□※you're▣▣volunteering,□▣I won't□▣※refuse!"
d_counseling_sin_19_9,□▣※I'll bring you□▣everything you need for our future counseling sessions.
d_counseling_sin_19_10,I've been※▣starving▣※myself for 12※※hours now.
d_counseling_sin_19_11,Lazi▣※ness will ※□always triumph!
d_counseling_sin_19_12,▣▣If I starve to death※□then▣▣my death is on your hands!
d_counseling_sin_19_13,I blend up Sin's food for her during our session.
d_counseling_sin_20_1,"Coun※selor▣□, what do▣※□you think of ※lying※?"
d_counseling_sin_20_2,Gu▣ilty says※there's nothing she despises more than▣※falsehoods.
d_counseling_sin_20_3,Lying is also a skill.
d_counseling_sin_20_4,Lying is bad.
d_counseling_sin_20_5,That's▣※what I say※.
d_counseling_sin_20_6,※Being a good liar▣□takes a certain amount of intelligence※▣※and wit.
d_counseling_sin_20_7,"□□You※seem※pretty□□smart yourself, Counselor."
d_counseling_sin_20_8,Why? What's▣※so ▣bad about it?
d_counseling_sin_20_9,What about▣white lies? □※□Are those bad?※
d_counseling_sin_20_10,※Is there no possible scenario where※there would be a good▣□reason for lying▣□?
d_counseling_sin_20_11,Sin and I have a discussion about lying.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_1,Here you go!
d_counseling_cocoa_01_2,Cocoa sets a plate of omurice in front of me and holds up the ketchup.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_3,As much ketchup as you can muster.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_4,Just a bit of ketchup.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_5,I knew you'd say that.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_6,Cocoa's eyes glimmer with delight.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_7,But... are you sure that'll be enough?
d_counseling_cocoa_01_8,Cocoa glances over with a look of disappointment.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_9,"... Fine, pour it on."
d_counseling_cocoa_01_10,You got it!
d_counseling_cocoa_01_11,*Squirt* *Squirt*
d_counseling_cocoa_01_12,*Squirt* *Spuirt* *Spuuuirt... Squirrrrt*
d_counseling_cocoa_01_13,... Phew.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_14,That oughta do it.
d_counseling_cocoa_01_15,I give Cocoa a thumbs up.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_1,"Master, do you prefer rainy days,"
d_counseling_cocoa_02_2,or sunny days?
d_counseling_cocoa_02_3,I like rainy days.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_4,I like sunny days.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_5,I like rainy days as well.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_6,It also makes me happy to see Cocorella enjoying herself in the rain.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_7,"I don't mind sunny days, but I like rainy days as well."
d_counseling_cocoa_02_8,It also makes me happy to see Cocorella enjoying herself in the rain.
d_counseling_cocoa_02_9,I agree to go out with Cocoa on a rainy day while bringing Cocorella along.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_1,Soda has been super handsy lately.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_2,"Whenever she gives me a hug, my face gets smooshed into her chest and I can't breathe."
d_counseling_cocoa_03_3,What can I do to keep her at bay?
d_counseling_cocoa_03_4,Fire some ketchup at her.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_5,Fire a gun at her.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_6,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_03_7,That's a great idea.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_8,I'm positive I'll be able to vanquish her with ketchup.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_9,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_03_10,You can't do that. Shooting a gun is dangerous.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_11,I don't want to hurt Soda.
d_counseling_cocoa_03_12,Cocoa and I brainstorm about how to defeat Soda.
d_counseling_cocoa_04_1,"Some customers ordered omurice today, but they ordered it to-go."
d_counseling_cocoa_04_2,"Do you prefer eating inside, or going al fresco?"
d_counseling_cocoa_04_3,I prefer eating in the restaurant.
d_counseling_cocoa_04_4,Ordering take-out and eating it elsewhere can be nice.
d_counseling_cocoa_04_5,As expected.
d_counseling_cocoa_04_6,"Since it's you, I knew you'd prefer eating with Cocoa."
d_counseling_cocoa_04_7,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_04_8,So you enjoy al fresco dining as well...
d_counseling_cocoa_04_9,You don't enjoy eating together with me?
d_counseling_cocoa_04_10,I decide to eat omurice with Cocoa in the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_cocoa_05_1,Master!
d_counseling_cocoa_05_2,Cocoa holds out her thumb.
d_counseling_cocoa_05_3,Also give a thumbs up.
d_counseling_cocoa_05_4,Shake Cocoa's hand.
d_counseling_cocoa_05_5,"Such lovely manners you have, Master!"
d_counseling_cocoa_05_6,Very admirable.
d_counseling_cocoa_05_7,...
d_counseling_cocoa_05_8,I wasn't asking you to shake my hand...
d_counseling_cocoa_05_9,Cocoa and I keep our thumbs up the entire time.
d_counseling_cocoa_06_1,Ade is always complimenting me.
d_counseling_cocoa_06_2,"I want to return the favor, but how?"
d_counseling_cocoa_06_3,Tell Ade what a good job she's doing.
d_counseling_cocoa_06_4,Give her two thumbs up.
d_counseling_cocoa_06_5,Is that necessary?
d_counseling_cocoa_06_6,"If she's actually doing such a good job,"
d_counseling_cocoa_06_7,why would I have to point it out?
d_counseling_cocoa_06_8,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_06_9,A double thumbs up?
d_counseling_cocoa_06_10,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_cocoa_06_11,I have a discussion with Cocoa about how to compliment Ade.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_1,A customer told me today that
d_counseling_cocoa_07_2,it's not polite to open your umbrella in a cafe.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_3,What's your stance on that?
d_counseling_cocoa_07_4,Opening an umbrella indoors is generally frowned upon.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_5,"If you're a maid, you can open your umbrella wherever you want."
d_counseling_cocoa_07_6,It is?
d_counseling_cocoa_07_7,But I'm not like everybody else.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_8,I'm a maid.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_9,A professional one at that.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_10,That's what I was saying.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_11,"You know more about maids than some actual maids, Master."
d_counseling_cocoa_07_12,Amazing.
d_counseling_cocoa_07_13,Cocoa and I talk about what maids can and cannot do in public.
d_counseling_cocoa_08_1,"I brought a customer a menu today,"
d_counseling_cocoa_08_2,and they looked up at me with this solemn expression.
d_counseling_cocoa_08_3,Why do you think that was?
d_counseling_cocoa_08_4,She felt inferior standing next to someone as cool as you.
d_counseling_cocoa_08_5,She might have wanted another maid to serve her.
d_counseling_cocoa_08_6,Am I really that cool?
d_counseling_cocoa_08_7,"I didn't know that the face people made when they encounter someone they think is cool, but now I know."
d_counseling_cocoa_08_8,"Problem solved. Thank you, Master."
d_counseling_cocoa_08_9,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_08_10,...
d_counseling_cocoa_08_11,So she didn't want to meet me...?
d_counseling_cocoa_08_12,I have a conversation with Cocoa about the customer's reaction.
d_counseling_cocoa_09_1,"Master, is there anything you don't go anywhere without?"
d_counseling_cocoa_09_2,My umbrella.
d_counseling_cocoa_09_3,Credits that I can use at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_cocoa_09_4,An umbrella?
d_counseling_cocoa_09_5,You don't have to carry one of those.
d_counseling_cocoa_09_6,"When you're with me, you can just use Cocorella."
d_counseling_cocoa_09_7,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_09_8,Because you want to see me every day?
d_counseling_cocoa_09_9,"That's so nice of you to say, Master."
d_counseling_cocoa_09_10,I have a conversation with Cocoa about things we won't go anywhere without.
d_counseling_cocoa_10_1,Master.
d_counseling_cocoa_10_2,I want a real challenge. Give me something to make.
d_counseling_cocoa_10_3,I want an opulent super-duper mega ultra omurice.
d_counseling_cocoa_10_4,"I want a delectable, supremely appetizing apple juice."
d_counseling_cocoa_10_5,Good choice.
d_counseling_cocoa_10_6,"For this one,"
d_counseling_cocoa_10_7,I'll use this brand-new ketchup I just made!
d_counseling_cocoa_10_8,Huh? Juice?
d_counseling_cocoa_10_9,But I prepared some brand new ketchup...
d_counseling_cocoa_10_10,Are you sure you don't want omurice?
d_counseling_cocoa_10_11,"I eat the omurice, which is plastered with ketchup, that Cocoa ended up preparing for me."
d_counseling_cocoa_11_1,"Master, do you prefer ketchup or mayo?"
d_counseling_cocoa_11_2,"I'm crafting a new menu, and can't decide which sauce to use."
d_counseling_cocoa_11_3,Ketchmayo.
d_counseling_cocoa_11_4,Ketchup.
d_counseling_cocoa_11_5,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_11_6,What is ketchmayo?
d_counseling_cocoa_11_7,Is it a mix of ketchup and mayo?
d_counseling_cocoa_11_8,"I've never made that before. I know a new challenge is always risky, but I'll consider it."
d_counseling_cocoa_11_9,"Yeah, you can't go wrong with ketchup."
d_counseling_cocoa_11_10,I should have known that'd be the answer.
d_counseling_cocoa_11_11,I have a conversation with Cocoa about the new menu.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_1,Master.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_2,What would you like me to draw using ketchup?
d_counseling_cocoa_12_3,Draw a self-portrait.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_4,Draw me.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_5,Draw myself?
d_counseling_cocoa_12_6,"To do that, I'd need a mirror, and this place doesn't have one."
d_counseling_cocoa_12_7,Can I draw you instead?
d_counseling_cocoa_12_8,All right!
d_counseling_cocoa_12_9,I've already drawn you many times before.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_10,I've been practicing on my own whenever I have time.
d_counseling_cocoa_12_11,I hang out with Cocoa while she tries to draw me using ketchup.
d_counseling_cocoa_13_1,"Master, what's your favorite food?"
d_counseling_cocoa_13_2,I'll make it for you right now.
d_counseling_cocoa_13_3,Savory omurice.
d_counseling_cocoa_13_4,Sweet and delicious fruit parfait.
d_counseling_cocoa_13_5,I can do that!
d_counseling_cocoa_13_6,I'll make sure it's nicely decorated with some ketchup on top too.
d_counseling_cocoa_13_7,Parfait?
d_counseling_cocoa_13_8,"I haven't made that before, but I'll give it my best shot."
d_counseling_cocoa_13_9,"I'm a pro, so I'm sure it'll end up at least being edible."
d_counseling_cocoa_13_10,I spend time with Cocoa while making food.
d_counseling_cocoa_14_1,"I'm trying to increase customer satisfaction at the cafe,"
d_counseling_cocoa_14_2,but I feel like I keep coming up short.
d_counseling_cocoa_14_3,What kind of service should I include?
d_counseling_cocoa_14_4,There's nothing you can do. The service at Maid Cafe is already perfect.
d_counseling_cocoa_14_5,Why don't you ask the customers what they'd like to see?
d_counseling_cocoa_14_6,"It makes me happy that you said that,"
d_counseling_cocoa_14_7,"but unless we get our heads out of the clouds, we won't be able to improve."
d_counseling_cocoa_14_8,!!
d_counseling_cocoa_14_9,"Master, you're a genius."
d_counseling_cocoa_14_10,"The customer is always right, after all."
d_counseling_cocoa_14_11,I'll tell Ade and Soda.
d_counseling_cocoa_14_12,Cocoa and I have a discussion about how to listen to customer feedback.
d_counseling_cocoa_15_1,Master.
d_counseling_cocoa_15_2,How good of a maid do you think I am?
d_counseling_cocoa_15_3,You're a professional.
d_counseling_cocoa_15_4,Hmmm...
d_counseling_cocoa_15_5,Darn right!
d_counseling_cocoa_15_6,I'm the best of the best.
d_counseling_cocoa_15_7,...
d_counseling_cocoa_15_8,Don't you consider me a professional?
d_counseling_cocoa_15_9,I have a discussion with Cocoa about what it means to be a pro.
d_counseling_cocoa_16_1,I had a conversation with Ade and Soda today.
d_counseling_cocoa_16_2,Ade likes hot cocoa and Soda likes iced cocoa.
d_counseling_cocoa_16_3,"Which do you prefer, Master?"
d_counseling_cocoa_16_4,"Warm cocoa, all day every day."
d_counseling_cocoa_16_5,"I don't care if I'm about to freeze to death, I'll only drink iced cocoa."
d_counseling_cocoa_16_6,I also prefer it warm.
d_counseling_cocoa_16_7,It's even better when you add marshmallows.
d_counseling_cocoa_16_8,Are you serious?
d_counseling_cocoa_16_9,How can you even taste the cocoa amongst all that ice?
d_counseling_cocoa_16_10,I have a conversation with Cocoa about... cocoa.
d_counseling_cocoa_17_1,I've got the day off today.
d_counseling_cocoa_17_2,What should we do?
d_counseling_cocoa_17_3,Do you want to go somewhere?
d_counseling_cocoa_17_4,Nothing beats resting at home.
d_counseling_cocoa_17_5,Sure! Where should we go?
d_counseling_cocoa_17_6,Cocorella says she wants to fly paper airplanes at the amusement park.
d_counseling_cocoa_17_7,"Booorrrrring... Unfortunately, Soda and Ade are busy, so..."
d_counseling_cocoa_17_8,Could you come with me to go fly some paper airplanes?
d_counseling_cocoa_17_9,I go fly paper airplanes with Cocoa.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_1,Some customers have no manners at all.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_2,How should I deal with them?
d_counseling_cocoa_18_3,Teach them a lesson about manners.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_4,Be rude right back to them.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_5,I suppose that would be the most effective method...
d_counseling_cocoa_18_6,Cocorella could be my co-teacher.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_7,But then I'd become a maid without manners!
d_counseling_cocoa_18_8,No self-respecting maid would demean herself like that.
d_counseling_cocoa_18_9,I have a conversation with Cocoa about manners.
d_counseling_cocoa_19_1,"Master, can you make origami using just a napkin?"
d_counseling_cocoa_19_2,I can.
d_counseling_cocoa_19_3,I can do it with my eyes closed.
d_counseling_cocoa_19_4,Can you teach me?
d_counseling_cocoa_19_5,I should have known better. I underestimated you!
d_counseling_cocoa_19_6,"In that case, let's have an origami competition."
d_counseling_cocoa_19_7,We can see who is faster.
d_counseling_cocoa_19_8,Hehehe!
d_counseling_cocoa_19_9,"Oh Master, you're hopeless."
d_counseling_cocoa_19_10,"No problem though, I can teach you."
d_counseling_cocoa_19_11,I spend time with Cocoa folding napkins into origami.
d_counseling_cocoa_20_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_cocoa_20_2,"I like you, Ade and Soda equally."
d_counseling_cocoa_20_3,"I like you as well, Cocoa."
d_counseling_cocoa_20_4,"Actually, I kind of prefer..."
d_counseling_cocoa_20_5,Ah ha!
d_counseling_cocoa_20_6,Great minds think alike.
d_counseling_cocoa_20_7,...!!
d_counseling_cocoa_20_8,Is there someone you like more than me?
d_counseling_cocoa_20_9,I have a conversation with Cocoa about people we like.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_1,Trainer! Here's a gift for you!
d_counseling_biscuit_01_2,Biscuit hands me a ball.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_3,Throw the ball as far as you can.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_4,Thank you.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_5,!!
d_counseling_biscuit_01_6,It's a gift... How could you throw...
d_counseling_biscuit_01_7,I'm guessing you don't like it?
d_counseling_biscuit_01_8,I threw it because I want to play with you.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_9,"Oh, I see!"
d_counseling_biscuit_01_10,"This is my favorite ball, hehe. I thought it'd be great if you have one too."
d_counseling_biscuit_01_11,I'm so glad that you like it.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_12,Shall we play ball games together?
d_counseling_biscuit_01_13,Ball games...!
d_counseling_biscuit_01_14,Biscuit's tail wags rapidly.
d_counseling_biscuit_01_15,Yes!
d_counseling_biscuit_01_16,I play ball games with Biscuit.
d_counseling_biscuit_02_1,Excuse me... Trainer!
d_counseling_biscuit_02_2,"Uh, isn't it... stifling to stay indoors today?"
d_counseling_biscuit_02_3,Shall we go out for a walk?
d_counseling_biscuit_02_4,Shall I open the window for you?
d_counseling_biscuit_02_5,"As expected from you, Trainer! You know me so well."
d_counseling_biscuit_02_6,"Hehe, this is great."
d_counseling_biscuit_02_7,Let's go out now!
d_counseling_biscuit_02_8,"No, I didn't mean to say that it's stuffy here..."
d_counseling_biscuit_02_9,I... want to go out for a walk...
d_counseling_biscuit_02_10,Can't we do that?
d_counseling_biscuit_02_11,I go for a walk with Biscuit.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_1,"Nom nom nom nom!
Nom nom nom nom!"
d_counseling_biscuit_03_2,I take a look at what Biscuit is eating.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_3,!!
d_counseling_biscuit_03_4,Uh... This is sweet potato-flavored Splendamin...
d_counseling_biscuit_03_5,W-would you like to have some?
d_counseling_biscuit_03_6,"Sure, thank you."
d_counseling_biscuit_03_7,I'm good. You can have it all.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_8,!!!
d_counseling_biscuit_03_9,You're really going to eat with me...?
d_counseling_biscuit_03_10,"Oh, it's not that I don't want to share it...!"
d_counseling_biscuit_03_11,Biscuit's tail droops low.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_12,I'm happy that we can eat together... Hehe...
d_counseling_biscuit_03_13,Really?! You don't need to stand on ceremony.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_14,Biscuit's tail starts spinning like a propeller.
d_counseling_biscuit_03_15,Hehehe...
d_counseling_biscuit_03_16,"Then I'll dig in now, Trainer."
d_counseling_biscuit_03_17,I feed Biscuit sweet potato-flavored Splendamin.
d_counseling_biscuit_04_1,"Trainer, which do you prefer?"
d_counseling_biscuit_04_2,Sweet snacks or savory snacks?
d_counseling_biscuit_04_3,Sweet snacks are the best.
d_counseling_biscuit_04_4,Savory snacks are the best.
d_counseling_biscuit_04_5,"You think so too, Trainer?"
d_counseling_biscuit_04_6,Hooray for sweet snacks!
d_counseling_biscuit_04_7,Just thinking of sweet snacks makes me happy...!
d_counseling_biscuit_04_8,*Drool* Now I'm craving it.
d_counseling_biscuit_04_9,Savory snacks?
d_counseling_biscuit_04_10,Uh... I heard too much salt isn't good for you...
d_counseling_biscuit_04_11,I prefer sweet snacks.
d_counseling_biscuit_04_12,"Well, they say too much sugar isn't healthy as well, but the sweetness really cheers me up!"
d_counseling_biscuit_04_13,I head out with Biscuit to buy snacks.
d_counseling_biscuit_05_1,"Trainer, what kind of weather do you like?"
d_counseling_biscuit_05_2,Rainy weather.
d_counseling_biscuit_05_3,Sunny weather.
d_counseling_biscuit_05_4,Oh... I see.
d_counseling_biscuit_05_5,"I don't like rainy days, because I get wet while taking a walk..."
d_counseling_biscuit_05_6,"Indeed! Sunny days are the best, right?"
d_counseling_biscuit_05_7,"The air is refreshing, and the ground is clean!"
d_counseling_biscuit_05_8,It's perfect for all sorts of walks! I love it.
d_counseling_biscuit_05_9,I check the weather forecast with Biscuit.
d_counseling_biscuit_06_1,Poli and Jackal are so nice.
d_counseling_biscuit_06_2,Just looking at them makes me feel... How should I put it...
d_counseling_biscuit_06_3,"It makes me feel acknowledged, so I feel great!"
d_counseling_biscuit_06_4,Is that the so-called bond between dogs?
d_counseling_biscuit_06_5,"That's the so-called bond between Nikkes, isn't it?"
d_counseling_biscuit_06_6,"You're incredible, Trainer. You saw through it right away!"
d_counseling_biscuit_06_7,"Hehe, dogs are telepathic with each other!"
d_counseling_biscuit_06_8,"Uh... Um, I guess you can put it that way...!"
d_counseling_biscuit_06_9,I meant to say that dogs can understand each other...
d_counseling_biscuit_06_10,Hehe...
d_counseling_biscuit_06_11,"... I want to tell her that Poli and Jackal are not real dogs, but I hold myself back."
d_counseling_biscuit_07_1,Trainer!
d_counseling_biscuit_07_2,Biscuit stares at me intently.
d_counseling_biscuit_07_3,Hehehe!
d_counseling_biscuit_07_4,She wags her tail furiously!
d_counseling_biscuit_07_5,Stroke her head.
d_counseling_biscuit_07_6,Grab her tail.
d_counseling_biscuit_07_7,"Hehehe, you know me well."
d_counseling_biscuit_07_8,I just thought it'd be great if you can stroke my head.
d_counseling_biscuit_07_9,Can you do it for a little longer?
d_counseling_biscuit_07_10,!!!
d_counseling_biscuit_07_11,Uh? What? Hmm? Trai... Trainer? Why did you suddenly grab my tail...?
d_counseling_biscuit_07_12,Uh... I wanted you to stroke my head.
d_counseling_biscuit_07_13,I rub Biscuit's head hastily.
d_counseling_biscuit_08_1,Trainer!
d_counseling_biscuit_08_2,Biscuit holds out a frisbee.
d_counseling_biscuit_08_3,Let's play together!
d_counseling_biscuit_08_4,Open the window and throw the frisbee far away.
d_counseling_biscuit_08_5,Lightly toss the frisbee toward the door.
d_counseling_biscuit_08_6,!!!
d_counseling_biscuit_08_7,That... That far...?
d_counseling_biscuit_08_8,I'll be back...
d_counseling_biscuit_08_9,*Chomp*
d_counseling_biscuit_08_10,Biscuit runs over and catches the frisbee with her mouth.
d_counseling_biscuit_08_11,"Haha! I did great, right?"
d_counseling_biscuit_08_12,Can you throw it again?
d_counseling_biscuit_08_13,I play frisbee with Biscuit.
d_counseling_biscuit_09_1,"Trainer, if you were to raise a puppy,"
d_counseling_biscuit_09_2,what kind of puppy would you want?
d_counseling_biscuit_09_3,A puppy like you.
d_counseling_biscuit_09_4,A puppy like Poli.
d_counseling_biscuit_09_5,Really?
d_counseling_biscuit_09_6,You're fond of puppies like me?
d_counseling_biscuit_09_7,"Hehehe. I'm also fond of humans like you, Trainer!"
d_counseling_biscuit_09_8,A puppy like Poli would be adorable.
d_counseling_biscuit_09_9,"Right. Poli is cute, so you'd obviously want to raise a puppy like her."
d_counseling_biscuit_09_10,...
d_counseling_biscuit_09_11,Um... I don't know why but... I feel a bit sad...
d_counseling_biscuit_09_12,I teach Biscuit the things one should know before raising a puppy.
d_counseling_biscuit_10_1,"Trainer, what kind of scent do you like?"
d_counseling_biscuit_10_2,The musty smell of a dog coming home from a walk on a rainy day.
d_counseling_biscuit_10_3,The fresh smell of a dog right out of the shower.
d_counseling_biscuit_10_4,... What?
d_counseling_biscuit_10_5,Uh... You like that scent?
d_counseling_biscuit_10_6,... Not kidding?
d_counseling_biscuit_10_7,Wow! You're right!
d_counseling_biscuit_10_8,"Dogs look fluffy and adorable at that time, and they smell good!"
d_counseling_biscuit_10_9,Biscuit and I talk about scents we like.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_1,Hmm... Conversation with Nero flows naturally. I can even tell her about my worries.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_2,But Leona always gives off the distinctive aura of a lion...
d_counseling_biscuit_11_3,It makes her feel a bit scary... and aloof.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_4,I know that Leona isn't scary at all and that I shouldn't be feeling this way...
d_counseling_biscuit_11_5,But I can't help it.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_6,What should I do to overcome this?
d_counseling_biscuit_11_7,Try roaring as you speak.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_8,Try covering your eyes as you speak.
d_counseling_biscuit_11_9,R-roaring...?
d_counseling_biscuit_11_10,"Good morning, Leona! Roar!"
d_counseling_biscuit_11_11,What did you—Roar! —do today?
d_counseling_biscuit_11_12,...
d_counseling_biscuit_11_13,It... It feels a bit strange!!
d_counseling_biscuit_11_14,Cover my eyes?
d_counseling_biscuit_11_15,Hmm... That seems like a good idea!
d_counseling_biscuit_11_16,If I don't see Leona's lion-like appearance...
d_counseling_biscuit_11_17,Maybe I'll feel less scared!
d_counseling_biscuit_11_18,"Thank you, Trainer!"
d_counseling_biscuit_11_19,I talk to Biscuit about overcoming her fear of her friend.
d_counseling_biscuit_12_1,I feel so happy when I'm with Nero!
d_counseling_biscuit_12_2,"Her triangular ears are so cute, and her smooth tail is super adorable!"
d_counseling_biscuit_12_3,The same thing goes for other cats. Why are they so lovely?
d_counseling_biscuit_12_4,Because they are born lovely.
d_counseling_biscuit_12_5,You won't think that way if you see cats making trouble...
d_counseling_biscuit_12_6,Right?! These sweet cats are perfect!
d_counseling_biscuit_12_7,"Aww, they're so cute."
d_counseling_biscuit_12_8,"Hehe, I'm going to visit Nero after today's counseling."
d_counseling_biscuit_12_9,What? Cats making trouble?
d_counseling_biscuit_12_10,What trouble?
d_counseling_biscuit_12_11,I never saw Nero making any trouble...
d_counseling_biscuit_12_12,I chat with Biscuit about how adorable cats are.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_1,Someone said that...
d_counseling_biscuit_13_2,they want to understand what dogs are saying.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_3,"How about you, Trainer? Do you also want to understand them?"
d_counseling_biscuit_13_4,I can already understand what you're saying.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_5,I do wish I can do that when they're sick.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_6,Huh? Me?
d_counseling_biscuit_13_7,Of course you can understand me...
d_counseling_biscuit_13_8,Ooh... I can communicate with dogs and pass you their message.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_9,So I'm the interpreter. I can help you understand them...
d_counseling_biscuit_13_10,That's right...
d_counseling_biscuit_13_11,Yes! Everyone says that
d_counseling_biscuit_13_12,"they don't know what's wrong with dogs when they're ill,"
d_counseling_biscuit_13_13,so they want to be able to understand what their dogs are saying.
d_counseling_biscuit_13_14,"Hehe. But as long as you have me, I can tell you what the dogs are saying."
d_counseling_biscuit_13_15,"What's ailing them, what they want to do... If you want to find out, feel free to ask me anytime!"
d_counseling_biscuit_13_16,I listen to Biscuit talk about the language and behavior of dogs.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_1,Trainer!
d_counseling_biscuit_14_2,Biscuit's eyes sparkle as she wags her tail vigorously.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_3,"Uh... Trainer, what kind of person do you see me as?"
d_counseling_biscuit_14_4,A cool and mighty puppy.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_5,A troublemaker of a puppy.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_6,Cool and mighty... Hehehe.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_7,Biscuit's tail begins wagging even more rapidly.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_8,I know you said that to make me feel good.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_9,"But still, I'm so happy! Hehe!"
d_counseling_biscuit_14_10,M-me?
d_counseling_biscuit_14_11,Troublemaker...?!
d_counseling_biscuit_14_12,Biscuit's tail droops.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_13,Really? Are you sure?
d_counseling_biscuit_14_14,... I'm just kidding.
d_counseling_biscuit_14_15,Biscuit and I have a short discussion about leaving impressions on others.
d_counseling_biscuit_15_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_biscuit_15_2,Biscuit stares at the snacks and the ball on the table.
d_counseling_biscuit_15_3,Hmmmmm...
d_counseling_biscuit_15_4,"Biscuit, catch!"
d_counseling_biscuit_15_5,Do you want some snacks?
d_counseling_biscuit_15_6,I throw the ball toward the door.
d_counseling_biscuit_15_7,Huh? Oh? Okay!!
d_counseling_biscuit_15_8,Biscuit brings the ball back.
d_counseling_biscuit_15_9,"*Huff, huff* I was surprised when you suddenly threw the ball."
d_counseling_biscuit_15_10,I was already hungry. Now I'm starving...
d_counseling_biscuit_15_11,"Uhh... I didn't plan to eat any snacks, but it seems like I have to now."
d_counseling_biscuit_15_12,!!!
d_counseling_biscuit_15_13,H-how did you know I want snacks?
d_counseling_biscuit_15_14,"Ah, is it because I was staring hard at them? Hehehe..."
d_counseling_biscuit_15_15,I planned to cut down on snacks cause I feel like I'm eating too much lately...
d_counseling_biscuit_15_16,"But now that it's in front of me, I'm craving it."
d_counseling_biscuit_15_17,Just have one. That should be okay.
d_counseling_biscuit_15_18,Really...? Can I really have one?
d_counseling_biscuit_15_19,I feed Biscuit some snacks.
d_counseling_biscuit_16_1,Trainer...
d_counseling_biscuit_16_2,Do you like dogs or cats more?
d_counseling_biscuit_16_3,Dogs.
d_counseling_biscuit_16_4,Cats.
d_counseling_biscuit_16_5,Hehe. Really?
d_counseling_biscuit_16_6,"I like dogs more, too!"
d_counseling_biscuit_16_7,"But of course, I like cats a lot as well...!"
d_counseling_biscuit_16_8,"Wow...! I see. I like cats, too!"
d_counseling_biscuit_16_9,Then... do you not like dogs?
d_counseling_biscuit_16_10,Not even a bit...?
d_counseling_biscuit_16_11,Biscuit and I talk about our favorite animals.
d_counseling_biscuit_17_1,The dogs at the shelter are seriously so cute!
d_counseling_biscuit_17_2,I hope they can be happy forever. Hehe.
d_counseling_biscuit_17_3,"I hope you can be happy too, Biscuit."
d_counseling_biscuit_17_4,"They will be, since you're here."
d_counseling_biscuit_17_5,Hehe! I'm already very happy!
d_counseling_biscuit_17_6,"I have Nero by my side, and Leona!"
d_counseling_biscuit_17_7,"And you, Trainer!"
d_counseling_biscuit_17_8,!!
d_counseling_biscuit_17_9,Really? That would be great!
d_counseling_biscuit_17_10,I'm also very happy because of them!
d_counseling_biscuit_17_11,Biscuit and I talk about happiness.
d_counseling_biscuit_18_1,The dogs at the shelter hate having their teeth brushed.
d_counseling_biscuit_18_2,What should I do to give their teeth a good brush?
d_counseling_biscuit_18_3,You can just lead by example.
d_counseling_biscuit_18_4,How about giving them snacks after brushing their teeth?
d_counseling_biscuit_18_5,... Uh.
d_counseling_biscuit_18_6,I also don't like brushing my teeth though...!
d_counseling_biscuit_18_7,"... But I do have to set a good example, right...?"
d_counseling_biscuit_18_8,... I wonder if there is snack-flavored toothpaste?
d_counseling_biscuit_18_9,"Wow! That's a wonderful idea, Trainer!"
d_counseling_biscuit_18_10,I can teach them while giving them snacks! Win-win!
d_counseling_biscuit_18_11,"Hehe. If I brush my teeth properly, will you also give me snacks?"
d_counseling_biscuit_18_12,I pick out some yummy toothpaste with Biscuit.
d_counseling_biscuit_19_1,*Gurgle*
d_counseling_biscuit_19_2,... Oof!
d_counseling_biscuit_19_3,Trainer... I'm hungry.
d_counseling_biscuit_19_4,Give her chocolate.
d_counseling_biscuit_19_5,Give her sweet potato sticks.
d_counseling_biscuit_19_6,!!
d_counseling_biscuit_19_7,"Chocolates... are not my cup of tea, sorry."
d_counseling_biscuit_19_8,Biscuit's tail starts wagging quickly.
d_counseling_biscuit_19_9,*Drool*
d_counseling_biscuit_19_10,"This is my favorite... I can eat it, right?!"
d_counseling_biscuit_19_11,I give Biscuit her favorite snack and spend some time with her.
d_counseling_biscuit_20_1,"There's a new puppy at the shelter, but it's very shy!"
d_counseling_biscuit_20_2,How can I get to know it better?
d_counseling_biscuit_20_3,Be patient and wait until it approaches you.
d_counseling_biscuit_20_4,"Why don't you try approaching it, Biscuit?"
d_counseling_biscuit_20_5,Yeah... I want to play with it right away...!
d_counseling_biscuit_20_6,"Hehe. But I have to give it some time, right?"
d_counseling_biscuit_20_7,"After all, it's still unfamiliar with this place...!"
d_counseling_biscuit_20_8,I hope the puppy opens its heart soon!
d_counseling_biscuit_20_9,"I went up to it when it arrived, but it turned and hid in the corner...!"
d_counseling_biscuit_20_10,What if it gets more afraid of me?
d_counseling_biscuit_20_11,I should just watch from afar and wait until it gets used to being here.
d_counseling_biscuit_20_12,I listen to Biscuit talk about the new puppy.
d_counseling_soda_01_1,Oh boy...
d_counseling_soda_01_2,I screwed up again today.
d_counseling_soda_01_3,It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes.
d_counseling_soda_01_4,How about you just stick to cleaning?
d_counseling_soda_01_5,"You say that so easily, but I really don't want to make any more mistakes."
d_counseling_soda_01_6,"Either way, thanks for the encouraging words. I feel better already."
d_counseling_soda_01_7,I've gotta cheer myself up and keep taking orders!
d_counseling_soda_01_8,No way! No can do!
d_counseling_soda_01_9,I'm much too busy working at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_soda_01_10,I practice taking orders with Soda.
d_counseling_soda_02_1,Cleaning is the bee's knees!
d_counseling_soda_02_2,"Clean clean, squeaky clean!"
d_counseling_soda_02_3,Want to clean together?
d_counseling_soda_02_4,Cleaning is such a hassle.
d_counseling_soda_02_5,Sure!
d_counseling_soda_02_6,It'll be great having someone else join me!
d_counseling_soda_02_7,What should we start with? How about the table?
d_counseling_soda_02_8,"*Gasp* Do you hate cleaning, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_02_9,"Whenever I clean, it feels like I've been cleansed myself!"
d_counseling_soda_02_10,Soda and I chat about cleaning for a while.
d_counseling_soda_03_1,Master!
d_counseling_soda_03_2,Do you prefer sunny or rainy days?
d_counseling_soda_03_3,I like sunny days.
d_counseling_soda_03_4,I like rainy days.
d_counseling_soda_03_5,Me too!
d_counseling_soda_03_6,Nothing beats the smell of a freshly sun-dried quilt.
d_counseling_soda_03_7,"I can't clean most places when it's raining, so I can get a bit down in the dumps."
d_counseling_soda_03_8,But there must be something to them if you like them.
d_counseling_soda_03_9,Soda and I discuss our favorite types of weather.
d_counseling_soda_04_1,Aw man...
d_counseling_soda_04_2,I broke a glass while I was cleaning today.
d_counseling_soda_04_3,Were you hurt?
d_counseling_soda_04_4,Let's go buy another one.
d_counseling_soda_04_5,"No, I'm okay."
d_counseling_soda_04_6,I appreciate your concern though!
d_counseling_soda_04_7,"Well, it's just that..."
d_counseling_soda_04_8,it was a limited edition cup. I'm not sure buying another one will be so easy.
d_counseling_soda_04_9,*Sigh* I really liked that cup...
d_counseling_soda_04_10,Soda and I discuss the type of new cup we want to buy.
d_counseling_soda_05_1,"I really like you, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_05_2,Maybe even more than cleaning.
d_counseling_soda_05_3,"I prefer you over cleaning as well, Soda."
d_counseling_soda_05_4,... Okay.
d_counseling_soda_05_5,Wow! Really?
d_counseling_soda_05_6,You and I are made for each other!
d_counseling_soda_05_7,"Um... don't you like me, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_05_8,"If you prefer Cocoa and Ade over me, just say so..."
d_counseling_soda_05_9,Soda and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_soda_06_1,We're doing some spring cleaning at the Maid Cafe today.
d_counseling_soda_06_2,Do you think we should start with the kitchen or the lobby?
d_counseling_soda_06_3,The kitchen.
d_counseling_soda_06_4,The lobby.
d_counseling_soda_06_5,I was thinking the same thing.
d_counseling_soda_06_6,"If there's anywhere you want to keep clean at all times, it's where you cook!"
d_counseling_soda_06_7,"Okay, but the lobby is full of customers..."
d_counseling_soda_06_8,"If we go in there and start cleaning, we'll kick up dust everywhere."
d_counseling_soda_06_9,"Why don't we clean the kitchen first, and move on to the lobby after the customers are gone?"
d_counseling_soda_06_10,Soda tells me more about the plan to clean the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_soda_07_1,Master!
d_counseling_soda_07_2,What's your favorite food? Tell me and I'll make it for you.
d_counseling_soda_07_3,Anything you make is my favorite.
d_counseling_soda_07_4,I'm not really hungry.
d_counseling_soda_07_5,"Wow, really?!"
d_counseling_soda_07_6,"That's so nice of you, Master."
d_counseling_soda_07_7,I'll cook something up for you right away. You're gonna love it!
d_counseling_soda_07_8,Oh... really?
d_counseling_soda_07_9,I was going to make you something super delicious...
d_counseling_soda_07_10,"Well, let me know whenever you get hungry."
d_counseling_soda_07_11,Time passes pleasantly as Soda whips up a storm for me.
d_counseling_soda_08_1,"Master, you look beat."
d_counseling_soda_08_2,Would you like a massage?
d_counseling_soda_08_3,If it's not too much trouble...
d_counseling_soda_08_4,"Actually, I feel fine."
d_counseling_soda_08_5,Of course it's not!
d_counseling_soda_08_6,"Hmm, where should I start? Shoulders? Arms? Legs?"
d_counseling_soda_08_7,Why don't you lie in bed first?
d_counseling_soda_08_8,Oh... you're not?
d_counseling_soda_08_9,It's just that you've got those dark circles under your eyes... I was worried about you.
d_counseling_soda_08_10,Soda gives me a massage.
d_counseling_soda_09_1,I want to put a cute pattern on top of your parfait.
d_counseling_soda_09_2,What should I draw?
d_counseling_soda_09_3,Cocoa's face.
d_counseling_soda_09_4,Your face.
d_counseling_soda_09_5,"Hee hee, Cocoa is awfully cute I suppose."
d_counseling_soda_09_6,I'll start with her mouth.
d_counseling_soda_09_7,M-me?
d_counseling_soda_09_8,"But I'm not that cute... well, I'll try my best."
d_counseling_soda_09_9,Soda and I have a blast decorating our parfaits.
d_counseling_soda_10_1,*Crunch crunch*
d_counseling_soda_10_2,...
d_counseling_soda_10_3,Soda is cleaning every nook and cranny of the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_soda_10_4,Is my room really that dirty?
d_counseling_soda_10_5,Is something on your mind?
d_counseling_soda_10_6,"Oh, hey Master."
d_counseling_soda_10_7,"No, it's not that. It's just..."
d_counseling_soda_10_8,"I'm feeling a bit blue today, so I was just doing some cleaning."
d_counseling_soda_10_9,"Oh, hey Master. H-how did you know?"
d_counseling_soda_10_10,"I'm feeling a bit blue today, so I was just doing some cleaning."
d_counseling_soda_10_11,Cleaning always helps lift my spirits.
d_counseling_soda_10_12,That's so great that you can understand how I feel!
d_counseling_soda_10_13,Soda tells me more about her thoughts and feelings.
d_counseling_soda_11_1,"I want to serve our customers meals, but I want to make it special."
d_counseling_soda_11_2,Do you have any suggestions?
d_counseling_soda_11_3,Try and make your eyes twinkle.
d_counseling_soda_11_4,You're already special as is.
d_counseling_soda_11_5,Hmm... like this?
d_counseling_soda_11_6,It's... gorgeous.
d_counseling_soda_11_7,!!
d_counseling_soda_11_8,Really? Heh heh.
d_counseling_soda_11_9,Then I'll give them service with a smile every day.
d_counseling_soda_11_10,Y-you really think that?
d_counseling_soda_11_11,But I want to be more special...
d_counseling_soda_11_12,"Hmm, how about if I try and smile like this?"
d_counseling_soda_11_13,Soda practices smiling for a while.
d_counseling_soda_12_1,Maid For You!♪ Maid For You!♪
d_counseling_soda_12_2,Guess what the lyrics are after that!
d_counseling_soda_12_3,Meet your special maid!♪
d_counseling_soda_12_4,Meet your special Soda!♪
d_counseling_soda_12_5,Bingo!
d_counseling_soda_12_6,I knew you'd get it right away.
d_counseling_soda_12_7,I've been humming this tune quite often lately while I've been cleaning.
d_counseling_soda_12_8,"Hee hee! It's nice to hear my name inserted into the lyrics,"
d_counseling_soda_12_9,"but they technically go, ""Meet your special maid!"""
d_counseling_soda_12_10,Soda and I sing together for a while.
d_counseling_soda_13_1,Cocoa gave me a big compliment today!
d_counseling_soda_13_2,Guess what she said.
d_counseling_soda_13_3,That you were the best cleaner around.
d_counseling_soda_13_4,That you were the best cook around.
d_counseling_soda_13_5,"Although I often get praised for my cleaning,"
d_counseling_soda_13_6,today she said the omurice I made was killer!
d_counseling_soda_13_7,That's right!
d_counseling_soda_13_8,"I made some omurice today, and you should have seen Cocoa's face."
d_counseling_soda_13_9,"She was practically beaming! Once she put some ketchup on it, it was second-to-none."
d_counseling_soda_13_10,I listen to Soda's secret recipe for omurice.
d_counseling_soda_14_1,Master!
d_counseling_soda_14_2,Is there anything you'd like to see me in other than a maid outfit?
d_counseling_soda_14_3,You look nice in maid costumes.
d_counseling_soda_14_4,It'd be interesting to see you in some casual clothes.
d_counseling_soda_14_5,"I like maid outfits too,"
d_counseling_soda_14_6,but I'd like to try a new look every once in a while.
d_counseling_soda_14_7,That's exactly what I was thinking!
d_counseling_soda_14_8,"I've been wanting to try some more casual styles, but can't decide on what to wear."
d_counseling_soda_14_9,Would you like to go shopping with me?
d_counseling_soda_14_10,I go shopping with Soda for suitable clothes.
d_counseling_soda_15_1,"I want work smarter, not harder, just like Ade."
d_counseling_soda_15_2,But all I ever seem to do is make mistakes. I'm so sad...
d_counseling_soda_15_3,"That's what makes you so endearing, Soda."
d_counseling_soda_15_4,No need to be a perfectionist.
d_counseling_soda_15_5,Really? That kind of thing can be endearing?
d_counseling_soda_15_6,"I'm glad to hear that people think that way, especially you, Master."
d_counseling_soda_15_7,I suppose that's true.
d_counseling_soda_15_8,"Still though, I want to be a perfect maid like Ade!"
d_counseling_soda_15_9,I discuss with Soda how to be a perfect maid.
d_counseling_soda_16_1,"One, two..."
d_counseling_soda_16_2,"Nice to have you back, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_16_3,... Hello.
d_counseling_soda_16_4,What's up with the bizarre greeting?
d_counseling_soda_16_5,"Hee hee, thanks for playing along."
d_counseling_soda_16_6,I wanted to see what it'd be like greeting you like a customer at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_soda_16_7,"I've gotta say, it felt pretty good."
d_counseling_soda_16_8,"It was like I became your own private maid, hee hee!"
d_counseling_soda_16_9,I wanted to see what it'd be like greeting you like we do with customers at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_soda_16_10,And? What's the verdict?
d_counseling_soda_16_11,Let me think...
d_counseling_soda_16_12,I'm not telling! Hee hee!
d_counseling_soda_16_13,Soda and I act as if we are in the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_soda_17_1,I went to Talentum Mall earlier today.
d_counseling_soda_17_2,They had a sponge that can clear away old stains on sale! It was going for half-price.
d_counseling_soda_17_3,But I've already bought a lot of cleaning tools... What should I do?
d_counseling_soda_17_4,A craftsman does not rely on their tools.
d_counseling_soda_17_5,Consider it an investment towards your own happiness. Go for it.
d_counseling_soda_17_6,Is that really true?
d_counseling_soda_17_7,But how else am I going to get rid of those ketchup stains in the kitchen?
d_counseling_soda_17_8,Now that you mention it...
d_counseling_soda_17_9,That's a great point! And so true!
d_counseling_soda_17_10,"Cleaning is what brings me the most joy. If I should splurge on anything, this is it."
d_counseling_soda_17_11,I help Soda balance the books for the cafe.
d_counseling_soda_18_1,Today we've got some cute cuddly bunny omurice hopping your way!
d_counseling_soda_18_2,"I figured that since we're not in the cafe, giving the dish a cute name might help give it that special something."
d_counseling_soda_18_3,"By the magic invested in me, I command you to be delicious! Moe moe kyun!"
d_counseling_soda_18_4,Alakazam!
d_counseling_soda_18_5,??
d_counseling_soda_18_6,Looks like my magic spell worked.
d_counseling_soda_18_7,"You look pretty cute when you're doing magic, Master."
d_counseling_soda_18_8,Do it again for me! Just once more. Hee hee!
d_counseling_soda_18_9,It's a magic spell.
d_counseling_soda_18_10,??
d_counseling_soda_18_11,To make your food more delicious...
d_counseling_soda_18_12,I thought you'd join in...
d_counseling_soda_18_13,Soda teaches me several pre-meal magic spells.
d_counseling_soda_19_1,Once in a lifetime opportunity! Get your photo taken with a maid!
d_counseling_soda_19_2,"Wanna try it, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_19_3,You can choose your own theme.
d_counseling_soda_19_4,Secret agents going undercover as cleaners.
d_counseling_soda_19_5,The climactic scene of a romantic-comedy.
d_counseling_soda_19_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_soda_19_7,Perhaps Cocoa would be better suited for something like that.
d_counseling_soda_19_8,Sounds intriguing!
d_counseling_soda_19_9,What exactly do people do during a scene like that?
d_counseling_soda_19_10,"Kiss, usually."
d_counseling_soda_19_11,Wh-wha?! Really?
d_counseling_soda_19_12,I had no idea...
d_counseling_soda_19_13,"Well, if that's what you want, erm..."
d_counseling_soda_19_14,I have a wonderful time taking selfies with Soda.
d_counseling_soda_20_1,"The shop window was all fogged up yesterday, so I doodled the password on there when no one was looking."
d_counseling_soda_20_2,Did you see what it was?
d_counseling_soda_20_3,A heart.
d_counseling_soda_20_4,A mathematical formula.
d_counseling_soda_20_5,Perfect! Password sent successfully.
d_counseling_soda_20_6,"The next time the window fogs up,"
d_counseling_soda_20_7,maybe you could draw a password for me to memorize.
d_counseling_soda_20_8,A mathematical formula?
d_counseling_soda_20_9,Am I a secret genius without even knowing it?
d_counseling_soda_20_10,Soda and I look into why the window keeps fogging up.
d_counseling_sakura_01_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun, I've been wanting to know:"
d_counseling_sakura_01_2,Which type of tea do you like?
d_counseling_sakura_01_3,Black tea.
d_counseling_sakura_01_4,Green tea
d_counseling_sakura_01_5,Me too.
d_counseling_sakura_01_6,"That short burst of bitterness, followed by a faintly sweet aftertaste, wins me over every time."
d_counseling_sakura_01_7,"Next time you come to visit, I'll treat you to some black tea."
d_counseling_sakura_01_8,"I can certainly see the appeal in green tea,"
d_counseling_sakura_01_9,but I personally have found myself preferring black tea lately.
d_counseling_sakura_01_10,Sakura and I talk about our favorite types of tea for a while.
d_counseling_sakura_02_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun, what would you do if you were the leader of an organization"
d_counseling_sakura_02_2,and you couldn't tell if the decision you were making was the right one?
d_counseling_sakura_02_3,I would believe in myself and keep moving forward.
d_counseling_sakura_02_4,I'd ask others for their opinion.
d_counseling_sakura_02_5,"You're one tough cookie, that's for sure."
d_counseling_sakura_02_6,You're right. The leader of an organization should have faith in themselves.
d_counseling_sakura_02_7,Only in this way can the organization be stable.
d_counseling_sakura_02_8,That is one way of going about it.
d_counseling_sakura_02_9,But there's an old saying: too many cooks in the kitchen can spoil the broth.
d_counseling_sakura_02_10,It's good if the leader of an organization trusts their own judgment.
d_counseling_sakura_02_11,I have a deep conversation with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_03_1,"You really are a gentle soul, {AccountData.NickName}-kun."
d_counseling_sakura_03_2,...
d_counseling_sakura_03_3,Are you this way with everyone?
d_counseling_sakura_03_4,"No, only with you."
d_counseling_sakura_03_5,"Generally, yes."
d_counseling_sakura_03_6,So you only love me and no one else...
d_counseling_sakura_03_7,I feel the same way about you.
d_counseling_sakura_03_8,...
d_counseling_sakura_03_9,So love comes easy for you...
d_counseling_sakura_03_10,Sakura and I talk more about love and gentleness.
d_counseling_sakura_04_1,"Whenever I see the cherry blossom trees outside the residence,"
d_counseling_sakura_04_2,all kinds of different emotions well up inside me.
d_counseling_sakura_04_3,How do you feel when you see them?
d_counseling_sakura_04_4,I feel very excited.
d_counseling_sakura_04_5,I feel very content.
d_counseling_sakura_04_6,Same here.
d_counseling_sakura_04_7,It brings joy to my heart whenever I see the cherry blossom petals floating by the trees.
d_counseling_sakura_04_8,So gazing at them puts you in a state of relaxation?
d_counseling_sakura_04_9,"I don't know whether it has to do with the time of year, or the cherry blossoms themselves,"
d_counseling_sakura_04_10,but they tend to give me more of a thrilling sense of elation.
d_counseling_sakura_04_11,Sakura and I talk about cherry blossom trees.
d_counseling_sakura_05_1,Lately I've been passing the time enjoying tea and practicing Ikebana.
d_counseling_sakura_05_2,What about you?
d_counseling_sakura_05_3,I've been studying hard.
d_counseling_sakura_05_4,I've been exercising.
d_counseling_sakura_05_5,I...
d_counseling_sakura_05_6,didn't realize that studying could be considered a hobby.
d_counseling_sakura_05_7,I see that you haven't been slacking off.
d_counseling_sakura_05_8,That's good to hear.
d_counseling_sakura_05_9,"If you'd like, you could come and try some Ikebana next time you're free."
d_counseling_sakura_05_10,I can teach you.
d_counseling_sakura_05_11,Sakura and I share more information about our hobbies with each other.
d_counseling_sakura_06_1,I find it troubling that I never seem to have anything to say to Moran.
d_counseling_sakura_06_2,"What would you do if you were me, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_counseling_sakura_06_3,Keep hammering away at it until something you say makes an impression.
d_counseling_sakura_06_4,Just give it up.
d_counseling_sakura_06_5,It's clear that you're a very patient person.
d_counseling_sakura_06_6,That makes two of us.
d_counseling_sakura_06_7,"Nevertheless, I feel that in Moran's case, it may be wise to give up."
d_counseling_sakura_06_8,Patience is clearly not one of your virtues.
d_counseling_sakura_06_9,"It is one of mine, but even I think that it may be smarter, in this case, to call it quits."
d_counseling_sakura_06_10,Sakura and I talk about Moran for a while.
d_counseling_sakura_07_1,What's your favorite flower?
d_counseling_sakura_07_2,I'll prepare some in the courtyard for you for the next time you visit.
d_counseling_sakura_07_3,Roses.
d_counseling_sakura_07_4,Cherry blossoms.
d_counseling_sakura_07_5,Roses always remind me of a certain criminal ringleader.
d_counseling_sakura_07_6,"I can't say I'm a big fan of such things,"
d_counseling_sakura_07_7,"but if that's what you like, I'll see that it's done."
d_counseling_sakura_07_8,"Ah, cherry blossoms. The snowflakes of spring."
d_counseling_sakura_07_9,"Rather than plant them in the courtyard, I always keep them in my most precious vase."
d_counseling_sakura_07_10,Sakura and I talk about our favorite flowers.
d_counseling_sakura_08_1,"Whenever you're dealing with something important,"
d_counseling_sakura_08_2,what's your general approach?
d_counseling_sakura_08_3,Stick to the procedure.
d_counseling_sakura_08_4,Improvise.
d_counseling_sakura_08_5,That's my preference as well.
d_counseling_sakura_08_6,If only everyone did the same.
d_counseling_sakura_08_7,"Not only would there be fewer accidents, but the final results would be much easier to predict."
d_counseling_sakura_08_8,"To be sure, no one appreciates a co-worker"
d_counseling_sakura_08_9,who freezes whenever the unexpected occurs.
d_counseling_sakura_08_10,"However, changes are a constant occurrence in almost every facet of life, so I don't like improvising."
d_counseling_sakura_08_11,I have a deep conversation with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_09_1,I'm curious.
d_counseling_sakura_09_2,What do you look for in a partner?
d_counseling_sakura_09_3,Someone with grace and sangfroid.
d_counseling_sakura_09_4,Someone who values loyalty.
d_counseling_sakura_09_5,Grace and sangfroid...
d_counseling_sakura_09_6,...
d_counseling_sakura_09_7,Sakura smiles.
d_counseling_sakura_09_8,I like that answer very much.
d_counseling_sakura_09_9,Loyalty?
d_counseling_sakura_09_10,...
d_counseling_sakura_09_11,That reminds me of someone.
d_counseling_sakura_09_12,But I wish it wasn't her.
d_counseling_sakura_09_13,I talk with Sakura about our favorite types.
d_counseling_sakura_10_1,"When I was out at the mall shopping today, I stopped by to see a fortune teller."
d_counseling_sakura_10_2,"When she read my fortune, she mentioned your name. What do you think that means?"
d_counseling_sakura_10_3,It certainly sounds positive to me.
d_counseling_sakura_10_4,I've never put much faith in fortune-telling.
d_counseling_sakura_10_5,You think so?
d_counseling_sakura_10_6,"... Yeah, maybe that was what the fortune teller meant."
d_counseling_sakura_10_7,I'll have to go see her again sometime.
d_counseling_sakura_10_8,So you don't think there's any truth to fortune-telling?
d_counseling_sakura_10_9,"Actually, neither do I."
d_counseling_sakura_10_10,...
d_counseling_sakura_10_11,"But still, it was nice to hear that you were a part of my future."
d_counseling_sakura_10_12,I talk with Sakura about fortune-telling for a while.
d_counseling_sakura_11_1,Most of my time is spent here inside my residence.
d_counseling_sakura_11_2,"Every once in a while, I do miss being able to hang out with my friends."
d_counseling_sakura_11_3,But I can't go out and leave my work unattended.
d_counseling_sakura_11_4,What should I do?
d_counseling_sakura_11_5,Hand over your work to a trusted subordinate and have some fun out on the town.
d_counseling_sakura_11_6,How about I come visit and keep you company?
d_counseling_sakura_11_7,"I've considered it,"
d_counseling_sakura_11_8,"but if people saw the leader of a criminal organization idling about in the streets all the time,"
d_counseling_sakura_11_9,it'd be quite a scandal.
d_counseling_sakura_11_10,...!
d_counseling_sakura_11_11,It's like you read my mind!
d_counseling_sakura_11_12,I was hoping that's how you'd respond.
d_counseling_sakura_11_13,Sakura and I talk about more indoor activities.
d_counseling_sakura_12_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
d_counseling_sakura_12_2,your clothes are so disheveled.
d_counseling_sakura_12_3,It's hardly appropriate for someone in your position to look that way.
d_counseling_sakura_12_4,Belorta played a prank on me. There was nothing I could do.
d_counseling_sakura_12_5,"I know. I'm so helpless. Help meeeee, pretty please with a cherry on top?"
d_counseling_sakura_12_6,...
d_counseling_sakura_12_7,How can you expect those under you to understand their leader displaying such weakness?
d_counseling_sakura_12_8,A leader must be a pillar of strength.
d_counseling_sakura_12_9,You're really laying it on thick.
d_counseling_sakura_12_10,However...
d_counseling_sakura_12_11,"You've performed many valuable services for me before, so I'll let you get away with it just this once."
d_counseling_sakura_12_12,Sakura leans in and straightens my tie.
d_counseling_sakura_12_13,Thank you.
d_counseling_sakura_12_14,You're welcome.
d_counseling_sakura_12_15,I talk with Sakura about how to wear a uniform correctly.
d_counseling_sakura_13_1,"Hypothetically speaking,"
d_counseling_sakura_13_2,"if you had feelings for someone,"
d_counseling_sakura_13_3,how would you express yourself to her?
d_counseling_sakura_13_4,I think I'd talk to her face to face.
d_counseling_sakura_13_5,"I wouldn't say anything, and keep my feelings hidden."
d_counseling_sakura_13_6,As would I.
d_counseling_sakura_13_7,"Whatever I want, I take."
d_counseling_sakura_13_8,I think this is the mentality that any leader worth their salt should have.
d_counseling_sakura_13_9,I didn't realize you were so tentative.
d_counseling_sakura_13_10,What if the opportunity passed you by? Things might end up far worse than you'd imagined.
d_counseling_sakura_13_11,I speak with Sakura about how to profess your feelings of love to someone.
d_counseling_sakura_14_1,I'm looking for books to read while having my tea.
d_counseling_sakura_14_2,Do you have any recommendations?
d_counseling_sakura_14_3,The Mafia's Youngest Son
d_counseling_sakura_14_4,The Mistress and Her Dog.
d_counseling_sakura_14_5,The protagonist of that book is mysteriously reborn as the youngest son of a mafia leader.
d_counseling_sakura_14_6,"He proceeds to defeat his rival siblings while vying for power, and eventually becomes the leader of the organization."
d_counseling_sakura_14_7,Um...
d_counseling_sakura_14_8,It doesn't sound like something I could really identify with.
d_counseling_sakura_14_9,That book is about the right-hand man of a criminal leader.
d_counseling_sakura_14_10,"He falls in love with the leader's daughter, and becomes despondent because he doesn't know what to do."
d_counseling_sakura_14_11,Hmm...
d_counseling_sakura_14_12,"If the protagonist made it all the way to right-hand man, he's no spring chicken."
d_counseling_sakura_14_13,"But if you recommend it, I'll check it out."
d_counseling_sakura_14_14,It's been a while since I read a fictional story.
d_counseling_sakura_14_15,Sakura and I both concentrate on the books we're reading.
d_counseling_sakura_15_1,My subordinates have been screwing up left and right lately.
d_counseling_sakura_15_2,"I've had to make my punishments more severe,"
d_counseling_sakura_15_3,but I don't feel terribly comfortable while I'm doing it.
d_counseling_sakura_15_4,"The consequences of one's actions, both good and bad, should always be clear."
d_counseling_sakura_15_5,You expect too much of them. Take it easy on them.
d_counseling_sakura_15_6,You're right.
d_counseling_sakura_15_7,I thought I had grown used to playing the disciplinarian role but apparently that's not the case.
d_counseling_sakura_15_8,... Yeah.
d_counseling_sakura_15_9,"But isn't that even more disrespectful to them, in a way?"
d_counseling_sakura_15_10,I talk with Sakura about the mentality of being a leader.
d_counseling_sakura_16_1,So many different emotions well up inside me when I see the cherry blossoms bloom.
d_counseling_sakura_16_2,Early spring is the best season to recite haikus.
d_counseling_sakura_16_3,What goes through your mind when you see the first cherry blossoms of the year?
d_counseling_sakura_16_4,I'm reminded of both the splendor and impermanence of life.
d_counseling_sakura_16_5,I think about Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_16_6,I can see why you would feel that way.
d_counseling_sakura_16_7,"Once they bloom, cherry blossoms fade away almost immediately."
d_counseling_sakura_16_8,Wait...
d_counseling_sakura_16_9,are you talking about me?
d_counseling_sakura_16_10,Yes.
d_counseling_sakura_16_11,Perhaps I shouldn't have asked this question.
d_counseling_sakura_16_12,Your response really... has me flustered.
d_counseling_sakura_16_13,Sakura teaches me some old-time haikus.
d_counseling_sakura_17_1,"My family tells me that when I was a child,"
d_counseling_sakura_17_2,I would always frolic under the cherry blossoms.
d_counseling_sakura_17_3,Now my memory is all a blur. I can't remember anything.
d_counseling_sakura_17_4,"But, whenever I see cherry blossoms, that feeling of excitement comes rushing back."
d_counseling_sakura_17_5,"Do you have any memorable childhood memories, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_counseling_sakura_17_6,"Actually, I can't remember anything either."
d_counseling_sakura_17_7,The hospital.
d_counseling_sakura_17_8,... I see.
d_counseling_sakura_17_9,That's too bad. For the both of us.
d_counseling_sakura_17_10,Oh...
d_counseling_sakura_17_11,So you were a sickly child?
d_counseling_sakura_17_12,"Well, I'm glad you've grown up to become much stronger."
d_counseling_sakura_17_13,Sakura and I flip through her album of childhood photos.
d_counseling_sakura_18_1,"You really are inscrutable, {AccountData.NickName}-kun."
d_counseling_sakura_18_2,"Sometimes you're weak, and others you're strong."
d_counseling_sakura_18_3,"Other times, you're incredibly gentle."
d_counseling_sakura_18_4,That's a side of myself I feel I'm unable to access.
d_counseling_sakura_18_5,How can I access that gentler side of myself?
d_counseling_sakura_18_6,It's also important to be comfortable with who you are.
d_counseling_sakura_18_7,Do you want to practice with me?
d_counseling_sakura_18_8,...!!
d_counseling_sakura_18_9,Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_sakura_18_10,You've made me feel much more confident.
d_counseling_sakura_18_11,Thank you.
d_counseling_sakura_18_12,What?
d_counseling_sakura_18_13,Try to be gentle with me first.
d_counseling_sakura_18_14,Are you sure this will work?
d_counseling_sakura_18_15,"You may find this hard to believe,"
d_counseling_sakura_18_16,but I've been trying to be as kind to you as possible this entire time.
d_counseling_sakura_18_17,I have a heart-to-heart with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_19_1,I found a new confectionery shop.
d_counseling_sakura_19_2,"The treats there come in all sorts of shapes: flowers, animals, human faces, and kinds of unique formations."
d_counseling_sakura_19_3,They've got lots of materials their customers can use to create their own confections.
d_counseling_sakura_19_4,Why don't we go and buy some sometime?
d_counseling_sakura_19_5,Why don't we go and make some together?
d_counseling_sakura_19_6,Sure!
d_counseling_sakura_19_7,"Let me know when you're free, and I'll clear up my schedule."
d_counseling_sakura_19_8,"Sorry,"
d_counseling_sakura_19_9,but I'm not all that interested in cooking.
d_counseling_sakura_19_10,"Especially with the kind of confections they have at that shop. There's a lot involved in making them, so I don't think I'll go."
d_counseling_sakura_19_11,Sakura and I check out the shop's webpage.
d_counseling_sakura_20_1,I'm the only one who uses Ichigenkin anymore.
d_counseling_sakura_20_2,"Nevertheless, it's a family heirloom."
d_counseling_sakura_20_3,"It feels like a part of me, so I've kept it all this time."
d_counseling_sakura_20_4,"Have you ever fired a matchlock rifle, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_counseling_sakura_20_5,"No, I've only seen them in a museum."
d_counseling_sakura_20_6,"I haven't, but I'd love to."
d_counseling_sakura_20_7,I'm not surprised.
d_counseling_sakura_20_8,That is the typical response I get from people.
d_counseling_sakura_20_9,Would you like to try aiming with it?
d_counseling_sakura_20_10,Sakura hands me her gun.
d_counseling_sakura_20_11,"Although it's an ancient relic, it's been modified for Nikkes, so it's heavy."
d_counseling_sakura_20_12,Let me help you lift it.
d_counseling_sakura_20_13,Sakura clasps my hand in hers as she slowly lifts the gun up.
d_counseling_sakura_20_14,!!
d_counseling_sakura_20_15,What's wrong? Why do you seem so startled?
d_counseling_sakura_20_16,"... Nothing. It's just a bit difficult to aim, that's all."
d_counseling_sakura_20_17,I listen to Sakura as she goes over the matchlock rifle in detail.
d_counseling_nihilister_01_1,Your hairstyle is rather unique.
d_counseling_nihilister_01_2,Huh? Why are you talking about my hair all of a sudden?
d_counseling_nihilister_01_3,... How exactly is it unique?
d_counseling_nihilister_01_4,It looks like a firework going off mid-explosion.
d_counseling_nihilister_01_5,It looks like a majestic lion's mane.
d_counseling_nihilister_01_6,"Haha, fireworks, huh?"
d_counseling_nihilister_01_7,"You've got a good eye. Better than I initially thought, at least."
d_counseling_nihilister_01_8,"However, you can suck up to me all you want, but I'm never holding your hand."
d_counseling_nihilister_01_9,...
d_counseling_nihilister_01_10,Have you ever seen a lion before?
d_counseling_nihilister_01_11,"If you have nothing better to do than pester me, I suggest you go to sleep, Human."
d_counseling_nihilister_01_12,My conversation with Nihilister didn't last very long.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_1,How strong would you say you are?
d_counseling_nihilister_02_2,Do you really have to ask?
d_counseling_nihilister_02_3,You should know better than most. You've fought against me before.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_4,Let me throw that question back at you.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_5,How strong do I look to you?
d_counseling_nihilister_02_6,Um... your strength is beyond compare.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_7,"You've got a clear weakness, so I don't feel you're all that strong."
d_counseling_nihilister_02_8,I should have expected as much from a weakling like yourself.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_9,Or is this just tiresome flattery?
d_counseling_nihilister_02_10,"Now, it goes without saying that I blow you and your compadres out of the water,"
d_counseling_nihilister_02_11,"but so long as my cohorts and the Queen exist, I don't want any brown-nosing from you."
d_counseling_nihilister_02_12,You have no idea how much that hurts coming from a human.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_13,What's worse... it's true.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_14,I'm working on it.
d_counseling_nihilister_02_15,"One day, I will personally take care of everyone who ever had any doubts about my strength."
d_counseling_nihilister_02_16,I share a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_1,...
d_counseling_nihilister_03_2,*Sigh*
d_counseling_nihilister_03_3,You seem stressed.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_4,You seem chipper.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_5,"That obvious, huh?"
d_counseling_nihilister_03_6,"I've got an appetite for destruction, and I'm starving."
d_counseling_nihilister_03_7,I feel like my patience is quickly coming to an end.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_8,"A word of advice: If you don't want to get on my nerves, get lost."
d_counseling_nihilister_03_9,... Chipper?
d_counseling_nihilister_03_10,Does me being helpless strike you as something that'd make me happy?
d_counseling_nihilister_03_11,Don't test my patience any further. Run along and get back to work.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_12,Before I incinerate this place and everyone in it.
d_counseling_nihilister_03_13,It seems that leaving Nihilister alone is the best option for today.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_1,"Nihilister, let's eat together."
d_counseling_nihilister_04_2,Sorry.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_3,I don't really eat food.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_4,"Besides, what reason would I have to eat with you of all people?"
d_counseling_nihilister_04_5,Fair point.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_6,"Come on, indulge me."
d_counseling_nihilister_04_7,Good. You catch on quick.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_8,How irritating it must be to have a human body.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_9,Having to eat and sleep even in a situation like this.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_10,Do you not understand English?
d_counseling_nihilister_04_11,Let me put this in a way that your little pea brain will comprehend:
d_counseling_nihilister_04_12,No.
d_counseling_nihilister_04_13,"After being rejected by Nihilister, I finish my food on my own."
d_counseling_nihilister_05_1,Have you always had a such flagrant disregard for your own well-being?
d_counseling_nihilister_05_2,"What? No, of course not."
d_counseling_nihilister_05_3,Kinda.
d_counseling_nihilister_05_4,Oh?
d_counseling_nihilister_05_5,What about the way you act towards me?
d_counseling_nihilister_05_6,"If that's not considered careless, I don't know what is."
d_counseling_nihilister_05_7,I'm disappointed you didn't pick up on that sooner.
d_counseling_nihilister_05_8,"I don't know if you're the luckiest person on earth, or something else..."
d_counseling_nihilister_05_9,"Anyway, I can clearly see how far you're willing to go."
d_counseling_nihilister_05_10,A mere human willing to cast themselves into the fiery pits of hell itself... Very intriguing.
d_counseling_nihilister_05_11,Our short conversation ends.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_1,...
d_counseling_nihilister_06_2,...?
d_counseling_nihilister_06_3,What are you starting at?
d_counseling_nihilister_06_4,I was admiring your weapons.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_5,I was admiring your face.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_6,"Oh, these?"
d_counseling_nihilister_06_7,These little guys really come in handy at times.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_8,They can turn pretty much anything into a shish kebab instantaneously.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_9,*Sigh*
d_counseling_nihilister_06_10,You're lucky. Any other human wouldn't get to live long enough to see my face.
d_counseling_nihilister_06_11,"At any rate, you're weirding me out."
d_counseling_nihilister_06_12,I have a conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_07_1,"Nihilister, I have something I'm curious about."
d_counseling_nihilister_07_2,"Your curiosity knows no bounds, Human."
d_counseling_nihilister_07_3,I'm not in the mood to deal with your incessant questions.
d_counseling_nihilister_07_4,"Fine, you get to ask one question. And make it quick."
d_counseling_nihilister_07_5,Do you still have any of your memories as a Nikke?
d_counseling_nihilister_07_6,"On second thought, I'll come back when you're feeling better."
d_counseling_nihilister_07_7,No.
d_counseling_nihilister_07_8,Satisfied? Now get out. You're getting on my last nerve.
d_counseling_nihilister_07_9,Actually...
d_counseling_nihilister_07_10,I'm feeling a little better now.
d_counseling_nihilister_07_11,"What are you so curious about, anyway?"
d_counseling_nihilister_07_12,I have a conversation with Nihilister while trying to cheer her up.
d_counseling_nihilister_08_1,Do you have any hobbies?
d_counseling_nihilister_08_2,Hobbies?
d_counseling_nihilister_08_3,Not really.
d_counseling_nihilister_08_4,What kind of thing did you think I'd do in my spare time?
d_counseling_nihilister_08_5,... Reading?
d_counseling_nihilister_08_6,... Exercise?
d_counseling_nihilister_08_7,"Look, Human."
d_counseling_nihilister_08_8,"I don't know how you got it in your head that I'm some kind of a bookworm,"
d_counseling_nihilister_08_9,"but reading isn't really my bag, all right?"
d_counseling_nihilister_08_10,"Well, I do feel a sort of release of tension whenever I break things."
d_counseling_nihilister_08_11,I suppose you could call that a kind of exercise.
d_counseling_nihilister_08_12,"All right then, my hobby is destroying things, haha!"
d_counseling_nihilister_08_13,Nihilister and I continue to talk about hobbies.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_1,*Sigh* I'm going stir-crazy in this place.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_2,Something needs to change or I'm going to start busting heads.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_3,Got any ideas how I can release some tension?
d_counseling_nihilister_09_4,Let's do some breathing exercises.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_5,We could play a game.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_6,"Oh, that's a good idea!"
d_counseling_nihilister_09_7,Some fire breathing is sure to do me some good.
d_counseling_nihilister_09_8,*whoooosh*
d_counseling_nihilister_09_9,Wait! Not fire!
d_counseling_nihilister_09_10,What kind of game?
d_counseling_nihilister_09_11,Whoever kills the most people wins?
d_counseling_nihilister_09_12,"It doesn't matter what game you pick, I'll stomp you either way."
d_counseling_nihilister_09_13,I spend time distracting Nihilister from her ennui.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_1,What do you think it'd be like if Vapaus was easy to obtain?
d_counseling_nihilister_10_2,"Either I wouldn't be here, or you wouldn't be here."
d_counseling_nihilister_10_3,Either of the two.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_4,Maybe both of us would be here.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_5,Or maybe neither of us would be here.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_6,"If the two of us saved each other, then perhaps that'd be a possibility."
d_counseling_nihilister_10_7,The only thing is that we wouldn't have done that.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_8,At least I wouldn't have.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_9,"No, impossible."
d_counseling_nihilister_10_10,"If no human could kill me, then it would stand to reason that I would be the ultimate weapon."
d_counseling_nihilister_10_11,That would mean I'd have to do whatever it took to defend my title.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_12,Anyone who defied me would be obliterated and turned into ashes.
d_counseling_nihilister_10_13,"That would include you, Human."
d_counseling_nihilister_10_14,Nihilister and I pontificate about other hypothetical scenarios.
d_counseling_nihilister_11_1,"Human, how do you like it?"
d_counseling_nihilister_11_2,... Sexy?
d_counseling_nihilister_11_3,... Well-done?
d_counseling_nihilister_11_4,Huh?
d_counseling_nihilister_11_5,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_nihilister_11_6,I'm talking about how you like your steaks.
d_counseling_nihilister_11_7,"Meanwhile, you're with your head in the gutter talking about what can I only presume is women."
d_counseling_nihilister_11_8,"Finally, something we can agree on."
d_counseling_nihilister_11_9,Nothing beats a nice crispy char on some well-done meat.
d_counseling_nihilister_11_10,"If you're exposing your food to open flame anyway, why not go all the way and go for well-done?"
d_counseling_nihilister_11_11,I share a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_1,"Nihilister, I need fire."
d_counseling_nihilister_12_2,Fire? Is it a battle?!
d_counseling_nihilister_12_3,What do I need to burn?
d_counseling_nihilister_12_4,I need some help making a bonfire.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_5,I just need a small fire to cook some food.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_6,...
d_counseling_nihilister_12_7,Fine. Just this once.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_8,"If you ever call me again for something this menial again,"
d_counseling_nihilister_12_9,you'll be what's burning.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_10,Wait a minute...
d_counseling_nihilister_12_11,Are you telling me you actually found some decent food on the surface? That's no mean feat.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_12,I suppose I can make an exception and do you a favor.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_13,I'll cook you up nice and crispy.
d_counseling_nihilister_12_14,"No, wait...!"
d_counseling_nihilister_12_15,"With Nihilister's help, I manage to procure some fire."
d_counseling_nihilister_13_1,"You said whichever Nikkes stick by your side end up performing better, didn't you?"
d_counseling_nihilister_13_2,What's the secret? Does it really amount to just sticking close to you?
d_counseling_nihilister_13_3,My devilish good looks.
d_counseling_nihilister_13_4,My skills as a commander.
d_counseling_nihilister_13_5,...
d_counseling_nihilister_13_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_nihilister_13_7,"You're somewhat easy on the eyes, I'll give you that."
d_counseling_nihilister_13_8,But not enough to entice all these Nikkes into following you.
d_counseling_nihilister_13_9,Pompous humans trying to be commanders for the clout are a dime a dozen.
d_counseling_nihilister_13_10,"Fame isn't what you're after, I know that much."
d_counseling_nihilister_13_11,"If you don't want to tell me, just say so."
d_counseling_nihilister_13_12,I have a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_1,"What would you most want in a partner, Nihilister?"
d_counseling_nihilister_14_2,That's a bit random...
d_counseling_nihilister_14_3,What I'd want most...
d_counseling_nihilister_14_4,I don't think I've ever thought about it.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_5,How about someone who protects you?
d_counseling_nihilister_14_6,Or someone who needs protecting?
d_counseling_nihilister_14_7,Nah.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_8,I prefer to do my own fighting.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_9,"If someone got in my way trying to protect me, I'd probably end up toasting them."
d_counseling_nihilister_14_10,Hmm... you're probably right. I suppose it'd be better for me to protect them.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_11,That way I could be in battles all day.
d_counseling_nihilister_14_12,"Sounds kinda fun, don't you think?"
d_counseling_nihilister_14_13,I have a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_1,Why are humans trying to reclaim the surface?
d_counseling_nihilister_15_2,"From what I hear, the Ark is perfectly livable."
d_counseling_nihilister_15_3,We're reclaiming what was originally ours.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_4,It gives us the strength to go on.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_5,"What, so you own it?"
d_counseling_nihilister_15_6,Don't be ridiculous.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_7,There's no such thing as ownership in this world.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_8,"Those with power, steal, and those without power get stolen from."
d_counseling_nihilister_15_9,Hm...
d_counseling_nihilister_15_10,I think I'm beginning to understand why you pathetic humans are still clinging on.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_11,Muddling through is still a way of surviving.
d_counseling_nihilister_15_12,Nihilister and I have a deep conversation.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_1,Can you tell me more about Liberalio?
d_counseling_nihilister_16_2,Ha! Now you're asking about my cohorts? You really have become brazen.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_3,Why should I tell you anything?
d_counseling_nihilister_16_4,She's someone you'll have to deal with down the line anyway.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_5,Something tells me you two aren't on good terms.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_6,True enough.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_7,"But the same goes for you too, Human."
d_counseling_nihilister_16_8,"We may have made a deal, but we didn't shake on it."
d_counseling_nihilister_16_9,We could never be on good terms.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_10,She's a mind-numbingly boring narcoleptic child.
d_counseling_nihilister_16_11,"At any rate, I haven't gone toe to toe with her, so I don't have much else to add."
d_counseling_nihilister_16_12,I have a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_1,"Nihilister, how is life up on the surface?"
d_counseling_nihilister_17_2,I don't know what you want me to tell you.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_3,Are you genuinely curious about what I do up on the surface?
d_counseling_nihilister_17_4,I'm just curious about what it's like to live on the surface all the time.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_5,It's not often I get to talk to someone who spends most of their time up on the surface.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_6,That's not a good enough reason to ask such a stupid question.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_7,I burn. I destroy. I kill.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_8,That's what life on the surface consists of.
d_counseling_nihilister_17_9,"If you're looking for a sappy love story, then go read a book."
d_counseling_nihilister_17_10,"You've spent a good chunk of time up there, you should know. You've probably seen your fair share of mangled-up bodies."
d_counseling_nihilister_17_11,"I hate to tell you, but you've seen pretty much all there is to see."
d_counseling_nihilister_17_12,"As for myself, I have a ball up here torching, destroying, and killing whatever I see."
d_counseling_nihilister_17_13,Nihilister and I have a conversation about the surface.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_1,Do you know about Johan?
d_counseling_nihilister_18_2,Johan?
d_counseling_nihilister_18_3,Who is that?
d_counseling_nihilister_18_4,The commander who fired the Vapaus at you.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_5,The commander who was at Eden.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_6,"Oh, that little pest?"
d_counseling_nihilister_18_7,Why bring up such an embarrassing memory?
d_counseling_nihilister_18_8,Now you managed to worsen my bad mood.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_9,"So, I see that pest has a name."
d_counseling_nihilister_18_10,He is an irksome fly that
d_counseling_nihilister_18_11,insists on getting in my way at every turn.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_12,I will take great pleasure in cremating him myself.
d_counseling_nihilister_18_13,Nihilister and I converse while thinking of Johan.
d_counseling_nihilister_19_1,I go towards Nihilister and hand her some water.
d_counseling_nihilister_19_2,...?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_3,What is this?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_4,Want some?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_5,"If we're talking about elements, water beats fire."
d_counseling_nihilister_19_6,Don't try and kiss up to me.
d_counseling_nihilister_19_7,"Besides, I know how important water is for humans who are up on the surface."
d_counseling_nihilister_19_8,You drink it.
d_counseling_nihilister_19_9,...
d_counseling_nihilister_19_10,And?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_11,Am I supposed to get into a fistfight with this bottle of water?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_12,Are you intentionally trying to piss me off?
d_counseling_nihilister_19_13,I have a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_nihilister_20_1,What do you think it would have been like if we met under different circumstances?
d_counseling_nihilister_20_2,What do you mean?
d_counseling_nihilister_20_3,How would that change anything?
d_counseling_nihilister_20_4,Perhaps we'd be on better terms.
d_counseling_nihilister_20_5,Maybe the situation wouldn't be as dire as it is.
d_counseling_nihilister_20_6,"I don't know if you're just a happy-go-lucky person, or if you're delusional."
d_counseling_nihilister_20_7,The only way that we would ever be on friendly terms
d_counseling_nihilister_20_8,is if we were reborn as siblings.
d_counseling_nihilister_20_9,"If you came here to waste my time on insipid fantasies, then I suggest you leave."
d_counseling_nihilister_20_10,"Believe me, things between you and me are as good as they could ever get."
d_counseling_nihilister_20_11,You know why? Because you're still alive.
d_counseling_nihilister_20_12,I have a short conversation with Nihilister.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_1,Human.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_2,How does it feel
d_counseling_liberalio_01_3,living in a world of total silence?
d_counseling_liberalio_01_4,Hard to say. It feels so natural that it's hard to comment on it.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_5,It's a great environment conducive to daydreaming.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_6,...
d_counseling_liberalio_01_7,True. Very true.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_8,You humans are such cacophonous creatures. It irks me to no end.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_9,"That is why I escaped alone, into the great silence."
d_counseling_liberalio_01_10,What do you mean?
d_counseling_liberalio_01_11,"You know, random flights of fancy. ""What would it be like if Liberalio was my sister?"" Stuff like that."
d_counseling_liberalio_01_12,How utterly puerile.
d_counseling_liberalio_01_13,"However, I do wonder what you would feel..."
d_counseling_liberalio_01_14,I have a short conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_02_1,What type of person is Nihilister?
d_counseling_liberalio_02_2,"Obnoxiously loud, without any sense of other people's boundaries."
d_counseling_liberalio_02_3,Why do you ask?
d_counseling_liberalio_02_4,"I was just wondering, since you saved her and all."
d_counseling_liberalio_02_5,"I was just curious, since your personalities seem so diametrically opposed."
d_counseling_liberalio_02_6,...??
d_counseling_liberalio_02_7,All I did was seal her mouth.
d_counseling_liberalio_02_8,And I didn't want to give up Nihilister's body over to you guys.
d_counseling_liberalio_02_9,Indeed.
d_counseling_liberalio_02_10,Everything that Nihilister does seems to get on my nerves.
d_counseling_liberalio_02_11,Would it kill her to learn to be quieter?
d_counseling_liberalio_02_12,Liberalio and I talk a little more about Nihilister.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_1,Liberalio tugs on my sleeve.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_2,Human.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_3,I want to hear your singing.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_4,Sing the latest hit ballad in the Ark.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_5,Sing an old ballad.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_6,Liberalio closes her eyes and listens to my singing.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_liberalio_03_8,Too fast. Too noisy.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_9,Sing something else next time.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_10,Liberalio closes her eyes and listens to my singing.
d_counseling_liberalio_03_11,"""Love is..."
d_counseling_liberalio_03_12,"yearning for your embrace?"""
d_counseling_liberalio_03_13,"If these lyrics have any truth to them, then... does that mean I love you as well, Human?"
d_counseling_liberalio_03_14,I sing the Ark's Top 10 popular songs for Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_1,Liberalio is fast asleep.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_2,...
d_counseling_liberalio_04_3,Hug Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_4,Run away.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_5,... Mmmm...
d_counseling_liberalio_04_6,Liberalio nestles into my chest.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_7,...
d_counseling_liberalio_04_8,"The moment I turn around,"
d_counseling_liberalio_04_9,Liberalio's missile port opens up.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_10,The reticle from the tip of one of her tentacles aims squarely at me.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_11,...
d_counseling_liberalio_04_12,Turn back towards Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_04_13,"I struggle to find ways to pass the time, waiting for Liberalio to wake up."
d_counseling_liberalio_05_1,I can see it now.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_2,"When I first saw you, you were with Nihilister, were you not?"
d_counseling_liberalio_05_3,Tell me everything you heard then.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_4,I didn't pick up much.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_5,She said she'd burn me to a crisp.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_6,"I'm not a fan of prevarication, Human."
d_counseling_liberalio_05_7,Don't make me regret letting you live.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_8,I see she is as bloodthirsty as ever.
d_counseling_liberalio_05_9,"At any rate, I'm glad she didn't turn you into ash."
d_counseling_liberalio_05_10,"Otherwise, I wouldn't have found you."
d_counseling_liberalio_05_11,Liberalio and I talk a little more about Nihilister.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_1,*Yawn*
d_counseling_liberalio_06_2,Did you sleep well?
d_counseling_liberalio_06_3,Very much so.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_4,I had a dream...
d_counseling_liberalio_06_5,Was I in it?
d_counseling_liberalio_06_6,Did you dream about arriving at Eden?
d_counseling_liberalio_06_7,Yes.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_8,You took me to a field of flowers.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_9,"I could hear the wind blowing, and you were singing..."
d_counseling_liberalio_06_10,"But other than that, everything was silent."
d_counseling_liberalio_06_11,Sounds like a pleasant dream.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_12,It was.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_13,"No, that wasn't it."
d_counseling_liberalio_06_14,"However, it would please me to make that a reality as soon as possible."
d_counseling_liberalio_06_15,I feel like I'm running out of patience.
d_counseling_liberalio_06_16,I have a conversation about dreams with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_1,Why are you so intent on wiping Eden off the map?
d_counseling_liberalio_07_2,The noise is unbearable.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_3,"Anywhere humans and Raptures intermingle, noise inevitably follows."
d_counseling_liberalio_07_4,I must wipe out... *yawn* at least one of these gathering points
d_counseling_liberalio_07_5,in order for my world to have a semblance of silence.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_6,Even though I have friends in Eden?
d_counseling_liberalio_07_7,What if Raptures just stay away from those locations?
d_counseling_liberalio_07_8,That is of no concern to me.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_9,"Just because your presence carries weight for me,"
d_counseling_liberalio_07_10,does not mean the same sentiment extends to your friends.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_11,"For every inch of the ground the Raptures retreated,"
d_counseling_liberalio_07_12,humans would only spread one inch further.
d_counseling_liberalio_07_13,"Eventually, another clash would occur, just on a different boundary."
d_counseling_liberalio_07_14,"Then the clamor would come once again, louder than ever."
d_counseling_liberalio_07_15,Liberalio and I discuss Eden.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_1,I stare intently at Liberalio's tentacles.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_2,What are you looking at?
d_counseling_liberalio_08_3,I was just wondering how you move those.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_4,... Can I touch them? Just this once.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_5,There's nothing to it.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_6,"It's just like how you walk on the ground with two feet, and lift things with your hands."
d_counseling_liberalio_08_7,They move without me having to think about it.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_8,"Curiosity killed the cat, you know."
d_counseling_liberalio_08_9,...
d_counseling_liberalio_08_10,Very well. I will allow it just this once.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_11,*Sssssss*
d_counseling_liberalio_08_12,The tentacles come creeping closer to me.
d_counseling_liberalio_08_13,... Liberalio proceeds to tickle me mercilessly.
d_counseling_liberalio_09_1,How did you deal with commotions when I wasn't here?
d_counseling_liberalio_09_2,"I either got rid of what was causing the noise,"
d_counseling_liberalio_09_3,"or I dove deep, deep down and slept on the ocean floor."
d_counseling_liberalio_09_4,Isn't the ocean kinda freaky the deeper down you go?
d_counseling_liberalio_09_5,It is quiet that far down?
d_counseling_liberalio_09_6,I wouldn't say scary.
d_counseling_liberalio_09_7,"It's just that you cannot see much of anything, and it's very cold."
d_counseling_liberalio_09_8,But none of that matters once I fall asleep.
d_counseling_liberalio_09_9,Absolutely silent.
d_counseling_liberalio_09_10,"All of the cries of pain, and Raptures exploding..."
d_counseling_liberalio_09_11,They become little more than a distant echo.
d_counseling_liberalio_09_12,Would you like me to take you there sometime?
d_counseling_liberalio_09_13,Liberalio regales me with more stories of the deep sea creatures she has come across.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_1,Do you prefer land or sea?
d_counseling_liberalio_10_2,Land.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_3,Sea.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_4,It makes sense.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_5,You can drown quite easily in the sea.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_6,"You are a human after all, and have human fears. It stands to reason that you'd prefer land."
d_counseling_liberalio_10_7,But you can't even breathe underwater...
d_counseling_liberalio_10_8,Why would you prefer the sea?
d_counseling_liberalio_10_9,I'm fascinated by the unknown.
d_counseling_liberalio_10_10,The fact that you don't know it very well is what attracts you to it...
d_counseling_liberalio_10_11,"In that case, do I stimulate your curiosity as well?"
d_counseling_liberalio_10_12,I share a short conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_1,"When your surroundings are particularly clamorous,"
d_counseling_liberalio_11_2,what do you do to get through it?
d_counseling_liberalio_11_3,I put in my earphones and listen to music.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_4,File a complaint with authorities.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_5,Earphones?
d_counseling_liberalio_11_6,Are you saying that I should use noise to cancel out other noise?
d_counseling_liberalio_11_7,You have said the same thing before.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_8,Authorities? What authorities? I don't understand.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_9,Think of it as asking a third party to intervene.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_10,...
d_counseling_liberalio_11_11,Sounds to me like that will just make things noisier.
d_counseling_liberalio_11_12,I have a conversation with Liberalio about how to deal with noise pollution.
d_counseling_liberalio_12_1,"Liberalio, is there anyone you're fond of?"
d_counseling_liberalio_12_2,...??
d_counseling_liberalio_12_3,I don't understand the question...
d_counseling_liberalio_12_4,I was just wondering if there's anyone who has a special place in your heart.
d_counseling_liberalio_12_5,I was thinking I might make myself more appealing to you to increase my chances of survival.
d_counseling_liberalio_12_6,Er...
d_counseling_liberalio_12_7,I don't know about all this talk of fondness and places in hearts...
d_counseling_liberalio_12_8,But there is one human in particular that I wish to possess...
d_counseling_liberalio_12_9,Don't fret.
d_counseling_liberalio_12_10,Liberalio places her hand over my heart.
d_counseling_liberalio_12_11,"So long as your heart beats, you won't die anytime soon."
d_counseling_liberalio_12_12,I have a short conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_13_1,Agh...
d_counseling_liberalio_13_2,So noisy...
d_counseling_liberalio_13_3,Are you okay?
d_counseling_liberalio_13_4,What are you hearing?
d_counseling_liberalio_13_5,No. The sound is louder than before.
d_counseling_liberalio_13_6,"I want to get rid of it,"
d_counseling_liberalio_13_7,"but if I go, you won't be here when I get back."
d_counseling_liberalio_13_8,Battle.
d_counseling_liberalio_13_9,The sound of Raptures being destroyed.
d_counseling_liberalio_13_10,It's almost as if they're in a frenzy
d_counseling_liberalio_13_11,expressly for the sake of getting on my nerves.
d_counseling_liberalio_13_12,I try to comfort Liberalio by having a conversation.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_1,Are you absolutely sure you don't want to come to humanity's side?
d_counseling_liberalio_14_2,I believe I've already provided an answer to that.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_3,Why are you asking that again?
d_counseling_liberalio_14_4,Even the mightiest tree falls after enough strikes.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_5,"Because I know that if I gave up asking, I would come to regret it."
d_counseling_liberalio_14_6,...??
d_counseling_liberalio_14_7,Endless repetition will not guarantee you success.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_8,All it does is further belittle your point.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_9,You would?
d_counseling_liberalio_14_10,Maybe you could move up to a position where you'll have more influence.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_11,Then you can make humanity quiet down and leave me in peace.
d_counseling_liberalio_14_12,Perhaps I should rethink this...
d_counseling_liberalio_14_13,I have a deep conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_1,Lovely weather today.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_2,I disagree.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_3,The sun is far too bright. It hurts my eyes.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_4,Lift up my hand to provide some shade.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_5,Getting some sun can be good for you.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_6,"Ah, much better."
d_counseling_liberalio_15_7,Will you stay like that for a moment?
d_counseling_liberalio_15_8,"Yes, just like that... until I doze off..."
d_counseling_liberalio_15_9,Not for me.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_10,I do not require sunlight to function in any capacity.
d_counseling_liberalio_15_11,Have you ever seen a Rapture sunbathing?
d_counseling_liberalio_15_12,I spend a casual afternoon with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_16_1,What is the difference between a Nikke and a Heretic?
d_counseling_liberalio_16_2,What a bizarre comparison.
d_counseling_liberalio_16_3,You mean to tell me you still can't tell the difference
d_counseling_liberalio_16_4,"between those pseudohumans you all created, and the Queen's elite forces?"
d_counseling_liberalio_16_5,I figured their origins might be similar.
d_counseling_liberalio_16_6,Surely there's not as a big difference as that between say... humans and Raptures?
d_counseling_liberalio_16_7,Perhaps.
d_counseling_liberalio_16_8,"Think of it this way. Humans evolved from monkeys, did they not?"
d_counseling_liberalio_16_9,"Yet we wouldn't compare the two of them today, not in any serious sense."
d_counseling_liberalio_16_10,"In fact,"
d_counseling_liberalio_16_11,the difference is even greater than that.
d_counseling_liberalio_16_12,"You've done battle with a Heretic before, have you not? You should know."
d_counseling_liberalio_16_13,I have a deep conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_1,I had a peculiar dream.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_2,"I went to the Ark with you, and"
d_counseling_liberalio_17_3,"suddenly, all this sea water came bursting in."
d_counseling_liberalio_17_4,Do you think it symbolizes the destruction of the Ark?
d_counseling_liberalio_17_5,What happened then?
d_counseling_liberalio_17_6,If you must interpret it...
d_counseling_liberalio_17_7,it was about you and I being the only two people left in the world.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_8,"Whales and jellyfish came swimming in,"
d_counseling_liberalio_17_9,and I started to play with them.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_10,I was enjoying myself. You were able to breathe underwater as well.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_11,You didn't try to run away from me either.
d_counseling_liberalio_17_12,I immerse myself analyzing Liberalio's dream.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_1,"Liberalio, do you have any unusual sleeping habits?"
d_counseling_liberalio_18_2,You should know better than me.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_3,You've seen me sleep more times than I can count.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_4,"The problem isn't so much you, but rather your... hardware."
d_counseling_liberalio_18_5,Sometimes you talk in your sleep.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_6,My hardware?
d_counseling_liberalio_18_7,"So long as you don't do anything that gets on my nerves,"
d_counseling_liberalio_18_8,I would never attack you without provocation.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_9,"You have nothing to fear, Human."
d_counseling_liberalio_18_10,What? What do I say?
d_counseling_liberalio_18_11,"You usually just complain about noise, or"
d_counseling_liberalio_18_12,whine about wanting to hear the sound of a heartbeat.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_13,I see...
d_counseling_liberalio_18_14,Not much different from when I'm awake.
d_counseling_liberalio_18_15,Liberalio and I talk about each other's sleep habits.
d_counseling_liberalio_19_1,Would you help me set up camp?
d_counseling_liberalio_19_2,Why?
d_counseling_liberalio_19_3,I don't need a bed to sleep in.
d_counseling_liberalio_19_4,"If you require assistance, ask your precious pseudohumans."
d_counseling_liberalio_19_5,But there's no one else around to ask for help...
d_counseling_liberalio_19_6,"Fine, then I'll have to go somewhere else and sleep."
d_counseling_liberalio_19_7,... So?
d_counseling_liberalio_19_8,The fact that I'm allowing this camp to remain standing
d_counseling_liberalio_19_9,should be considered helpful enough.
d_counseling_liberalio_19_10,...
d_counseling_liberalio_19_11,*Sssssss*
d_counseling_liberalio_19_12,Liberalio's tentacles slowly kick into action
d_counseling_liberalio_19_13,as they start helping set up camp.
d_counseling_liberalio_19_14,"After some minor back and forth, our camp is all finished."
d_counseling_liberalio_20_1,Why are you so loyal to the Queen?
d_counseling_liberalio_20_2,...
d_counseling_liberalio_20_3,I can't remember the initial reason.
d_counseling_liberalio_20_4,"As for now, it's to help make my dream a reality."
d_counseling_liberalio_20_5,And is that to exterminate all of mankind?
d_counseling_liberalio_20_6,And is that to make the world a quieter place?
d_counseling_liberalio_20_7,Yes.
d_counseling_liberalio_20_8,Raptures and humans. One of them must go.
d_counseling_liberalio_20_9,"Otherwise, this world will never be rid of its caterwauling."
d_counseling_liberalio_20_10,Yes.
d_counseling_liberalio_20_11,"However, when I hear the sounds that you emit..."
d_counseling_liberalio_20_12,I wonder if there are perhaps other methods I could use to achieve my goal...
d_counseling_liberalio_20_13,"... No, what a foolish thought."
d_counseling_liberalio_20_14,I have a deep conversation with Liberalio.
d_counseling_d_01_1,...
d_counseling_d_01_2,D is not saying anything.
d_counseling_d_01_3,...
d_counseling_d_01_4,What are you doing?
d_counseling_d_01_5,Leave her alone.
d_counseling_d_01_6,You're the one who asked for this session.
d_counseling_d_01_7,I was waiting for you to ask a question.
d_counseling_d_01_8,"If you don't have anything to say, then I'll leave."
d_counseling_d_01_9,Are you not going to ask me anything?
d_counseling_d_01_10,I thought you would start the conversation.
d_counseling_d_01_11,"If you don't have anything to say, then I'll leave."
d_counseling_d_01_12,"D turns to leave, but I stop her and proceed to have a real conversation with her."
d_counseling_d_02_1,"Before you reach a decision on something,"
d_counseling_d_02_2,are there any other factors that you consider?
d_counseling_d_02_3,What impact my decision will have on the world.
d_counseling_d_02_4,Not really. I just make my decision and go for it.
d_counseling_d_02_5,"It might sound somewhat arrogant, but it's true."
d_counseling_d_02_6,Some decisions can have a significant impact on the world.
d_counseling_d_02_7,"Therefore, you must deliberate on every decision you make, big or small."
d_counseling_d_02_8,"Once you decide, there's no going back."
d_counseling_d_02_9,Interesting.
d_counseling_d_02_10,That is indeed one way of going about it.
d_counseling_d_02_11,"However, you cannot always live your life this way."
d_counseling_d_02_12,There will come a time in your life
d_counseling_d_02_13,when you need to deliberate and weigh important factors into a decision-making process.
d_counseling_d_02_14,I have a conversation with D about the consequences of our actions.
d_counseling_d_03_1,What do you live for?
d_counseling_d_03_2,Money? Respect?
d_counseling_d_03_3,Both are important.
d_counseling_d_03_4,Neither.
d_counseling_d_03_5,I see.
d_counseling_d_03_6,You're the same as everyone else.
d_counseling_d_03_7,I don't believe I need to ask any further questions.
d_counseling_d_03_8,What then?
d_counseling_d_03_9,"No, don't answer."
d_counseling_d_03_10,I'll see for myself
d_counseling_d_03_11,whether your words have truth to them or not.
d_counseling_d_03_12,I have a conversation with D about what we base our lives on.
d_counseling_d_04_1,Let me ask you.
d_counseling_d_04_2,Do you consider yourself a good person?
d_counseling_d_04_3,I try to walk the straight and narrow.
d_counseling_d_04_4,"Yes, I consider myself a good person."
d_counseling_d_04_5,Good answer. There is no such thing as a person who is 100% good through and through.
d_counseling_d_04_6,There are only those who try their best to do the right thing.
d_counseling_d_04_7,That is why I must rid this world of all evil.
d_counseling_d_04_8,So that they do not exert their sinister influence over people like you.
d_counseling_d_04_9,You speak with such confidence.
d_counseling_d_04_10,"When the time comes,"
d_counseling_d_04_11,I will see whether there is truth to your words.
d_counseling_d_04_12,I have a conversation with D about being a good person.
d_counseling_d_05_1,It's a heavy load to bear...
d_counseling_d_05_2,Your body?
d_counseling_d_05_3,The life you lead?
d_counseling_d_05_4,...
d_counseling_d_05_5,I was rather referring to the weight of my mission in life.
d_counseling_d_05_6,"At any rate, I feel a bit better now."
d_counseling_d_05_7,... Yes.
d_counseling_d_05_8,"The eternal struggle between good and evil,"
d_counseling_d_05_9,"and how that pertains not only to my life, but to the lives of others."
d_counseling_d_05_10,You can say the weight of this crown is definitely the weight of life.
d_counseling_d_05_11,I have a serious counseling session with D.
d_counseling_d_06_1,How would you
d_counseling_d_06_2,make this world a cleaner place?
d_counseling_d_06_3,Get rid of all the garbage.
d_counseling_d_06_4,Reduce waste production to nothing.
d_counseling_d_06_5,Correct.
d_counseling_d_06_6,We can't stop garbage from being created so
d_counseling_d_06_7,cleaning up as much of it as possible once it's disposed of
d_counseling_d_06_8,is the only way to ensure the world remains uncluttered.
d_counseling_d_06_9,Do you think that is possible?
d_counseling_d_06_10,Humans create untold amounts of waste merely by living.
d_counseling_d_06_11,It's impossible to reduce that figure to zero.
d_counseling_d_06_12,I have a conversation with D about cleaning habits.
d_counseling_d_07_1,*Wiggle* *Wiggle*
d_counseling_d_07_2,D's bag is moving on its own...
d_counseling_d_07_3,What's wrong?
d_counseling_d_07_4,What is in that bag?
d_counseling_d_07_5,... Nothing.
d_counseling_d_07_6,I was wondering what you were staring at.
d_counseling_d_07_7,I assume you're wondering what's inside?
d_counseling_d_07_8,You've been staring at my bag this entire time.
d_counseling_d_07_9,Are you curious about what's in it?
d_counseling_d_07_10,I nod.
d_counseling_d_07_11,Let's just say it has something to do with one of my assignments.
d_counseling_d_07_12,I can't tell you any more than that.
d_counseling_d_07_13,"For your own well-being, I suggest you don't probe any further."
d_counseling_d_07_14,I try my best not to focus on D's bag...
d_counseling_d_08_1,"If you wanted to kill someone without leaving any trace,"
d_counseling_d_08_2,what kind of tool do you think you'd need?
d_counseling_d_08_3,One that got rid of blood splatters.
d_counseling_d_08_4,I'm not too sure.
d_counseling_d_08_5,Hm.
d_counseling_d_08_6,You talk as if you have experience with this kind of thing.
d_counseling_d_08_7,D puts her hand on her hatchet.
d_counseling_d_08_8,... It's just something I overheard the Nikkes saying one time.
d_counseling_d_08_9,I see.
d_counseling_d_08_10,D removes her hand from the hatchet.
d_counseling_d_08_11,"... I'll keep that in mind, then."
d_counseling_d_08_12,I figured as much.
d_counseling_d_08_13,How could you know something like that?
d_counseling_d_08_14,You've never found yourself in a situation where you'd need something like that.
d_counseling_d_08_15,... Right?
d_counseling_d_08_16,I spend a somewhat nerve-wracking session with D.
d_counseling_d_09_1,"Do you prefer the head,"
d_counseling_d_09_2,or the body?
d_counseling_d_09_3,Both are fine with me.
d_counseling_d_09_4,I can't really decide on that.
d_counseling_d_09_5,I see.
d_counseling_d_09_6,"In that case, I'll cut it straight down the middle."
d_counseling_d_09_7,D takes out a bear-shaped cake.
d_counseling_d_09_8,What's the cake for?
d_counseling_d_09_9,"I found it during a mission, but it's far too large for me to eat by myself."
d_counseling_d_09_10,I'll cut it in half and we can share it.
d_counseling_d_09_11,Why not?
d_counseling_d_09_12,Are you saying you don't want to eat any of it?
d_counseling_d_09_13,Eat? What are you talking about?
d_counseling_d_09_14,D takes out a bear-shaped cake.
d_counseling_d_09_15,"I found it during a mission, but it's far too large for me to eat by myself."
d_counseling_d_09_16,"If you don't want any, that's your loss."
d_counseling_d_09_17,D shares the cake with me.
d_counseling_d_10_1,"If at some point in time,"
d_counseling_d_10_2,there is a day I choose to go to the dark side...
d_counseling_d_10_3,That day will never come.
d_counseling_d_10_4,I will do what has to be done and take you down.
d_counseling_d_10_5,I wouldn't be so sure. This world we live in is a capricious one.
d_counseling_d_10_6,Meaning even I can change.
d_counseling_d_10_7,If that does come to pass...
d_counseling_d_10_8,do whatever you must to put a stop to me. Evil must not be allowed to spread.
d_counseling_d_10_9,Understand?
d_counseling_d_10_10,!!
d_counseling_d_10_11,... Yes.
d_counseling_d_10_12,I trust you to do the right thing.
d_counseling_d_10_13,D and I ponder about what might potentially happen in the future.
d_counseling_d_11_1,"Say there is something you need to do today, but you are very tired."
d_counseling_d_11_2,To the point you can barely keep your eyes open.
d_counseling_d_11_3,What would you do then?
d_counseling_d_11_4,I wouldn't procrastinate and finish what I intended to do that day.
d_counseling_d_11_5,I'd save it for another day.
d_counseling_d_11_6,You and I think alike.
d_counseling_d_11_7,One's obligations should be taken seriously.
d_counseling_d_11_8,"That way, things won't pile up and overwhelm you."
d_counseling_d_11_9,"If you continually put things off,"
d_counseling_d_11_10,they'll pile up and eventually overwhelm you.
d_counseling_d_11_11,"When that happens, your judgment is liable to be impaired."
d_counseling_d_11_12,This is something that must never be allowed to happen.
d_counseling_d_11_13,I have a conversation with D about various tasks that needed to be done today.
d_counseling_d_12_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_12_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_12_3,"Sorry, I'm late."
d_counseling_d_12_4,"My name's Daisy, and I'll be your counselor today."
d_counseling_d_12_5,"Some counselor you are, being late to an appointment. You're fired!"
d_counseling_d_12_6,Who are you...?
d_counseling_d_12_7,Very good.
d_counseling_d_12_8,I see you're quite proficient at improv.
d_counseling_d_12_9,That could come in handy for future missions.
d_counseling_d_12_10,*Sigh*
d_counseling_d_12_11,It seems that you're not the most adept at playing along with improv.
d_counseling_d_12_12,I'll have to keep that in mind for our future missions.
d_counseling_d_12_13,I practice acting with D.
d_counseling_d_13_1,"It's time for our session, but D is not here."
d_counseling_d_13_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_13_3,...
d_counseling_d_13_4,!!
d_counseling_d_13_5,I can pick up the faint smell of blood on D.
d_counseling_d_13_6,Did you just get back from... work?
d_counseling_d_13_7,Do you want to go wash up first?
d_counseling_d_13_8,Yes.
d_counseling_d_13_9,Perhaps we should reschedule.
d_counseling_d_13_10,Don't wait up for me. Go and do whatever else you have to do.
d_counseling_d_13_11,...
d_counseling_d_13_12,Fine. I'll go take a shower and be right back.
d_counseling_d_13_13,"If there's anything else you need to do, feel free to take care of that first."
d_counseling_d_13_14,D heads towards the shower.
d_counseling_d_14_1,Tell me.
d_counseling_d_14_2,Aren't you scared of me?
d_counseling_d_14_3,I haven't done anything wrong. Why should I be scared?
d_counseling_d_14_4,A little.
d_counseling_d_14_5,... I see.
d_counseling_d_14_6,D gives me a slight grin.
d_counseling_d_14_7,You're right.
d_counseling_d_14_8,"So long as you never do anything immoral, I'll never turn on you."
d_counseling_d_14_9,I promise.
d_counseling_d_14_10,I see.
d_counseling_d_14_11,Understandable.
d_counseling_d_14_12,I can see how what I do would inspire fear in others.
d_counseling_d_14_13,I have a conversation with D about jobs.
d_counseling_d_15_1,What is atonement to you?
d_counseling_d_15_2,Doing whatever it takes to be forgiven.
d_counseling_d_15_3,Taking full responsibility for your actions.
d_counseling_d_15_4,Forgiveness?
d_counseling_d_15_5,"If you murdered someone, who would forgive you?"
d_counseling_d_15_6,The one you killed? Their friends and loved ones?
d_counseling_d_15_7,No. There is no such thing as forgiveness in that instance.
d_counseling_d_15_8,Well said.
d_counseling_d_15_9,"If you have committed a transgression,"
d_counseling_d_15_10,you must face the consequences.
d_counseling_d_15_11,"Once you have sinned, that is a cross that you must bear for the rest of your life."
d_counseling_d_15_12,"That to me, is what atonement is."
d_counseling_d_15_13,"I, too, have my own cross to bear."
d_counseling_d_15_14,And it will be with me for all my days.
d_counseling_d_15_15,I have a conversation with D about the repercussions of sin.
d_counseling_d_16_1,"Let's say you're out for a stroll, and you suddenly see your target."
d_counseling_d_16_2,What do you do?
d_counseling_d_16_3,I act casually and continue along my merry way.
d_counseling_d_16_4,I try to follow them.
d_counseling_d_16_5,Correct.
d_counseling_d_16_6,"When you are not ready,"
d_counseling_d_16_7,it is best to not act recklessly.
d_counseling_d_16_8,"Otherwise, your target might catch on to you."
d_counseling_d_16_9,You would follow them even though you were not prepared?
d_counseling_d_16_10,Do not act recklessly.
d_counseling_d_16_11,You might give yourself away.
d_counseling_d_16_12,I have a conversation with D about dealing with different situations.
d_counseling_d_17_1,What's your favorite kind of weather?
d_counseling_d_17_2,Rainy days.
d_counseling_d_17_3,Sunny days.
d_counseling_d_17_4,"I enjoy rainy days as well,"
d_counseling_d_17_5,but for a different reason than you.
d_counseling_d_17_6,"I'd say that if you want your assassination to remain unperceived,"
d_counseling_d_17_7,don't miss out on rainy days.
d_counseling_d_17_8,I prefer rainy days.
d_counseling_d_17_9,"Unlike a flurry of rain,"
d_counseling_d_17_10,sunshine doesn't help you with washing away the smell of death. Not at all.
d_counseling_d_17_11,I check tomorrow's weather with D.
d_counseling_d_18_1,What do you like to do on your days off?
d_counseling_d_18_2,I don't take days off.
d_counseling_d_18_3,I sleep.
d_counseling_d_18_4,Don't overdo it.
d_counseling_d_18_5,"You are a human, so getting rest is imperative."
d_counseling_d_18_6,"Otherwise, lack of sleep might cloud your judgment."
d_counseling_d_18_7,Smart. It's imperative that humans get adequate rest.
d_counseling_d_18_8,"To maintain good judgment, it's important to keep yourself in tip-top shape."
d_counseling_d_18_9,Don't ever forget that.
d_counseling_d_18_10,I have a conversation with D about ways of resting.
d_counseling_d_19_1,One day you receive a gift from a stranger.
d_counseling_d_19_2,What do you do?
d_counseling_d_19_3,I check whether the gift contains anything dangerous.
d_counseling_d_19_4,I celebrate the fact I've gotten a gift.
d_counseling_d_19_5,Very good. You must be cautious at all times.
d_counseling_d_19_6,There is no way of knowing what kind of method will be used to assassinate you.
d_counseling_d_19_7,Don't let yourself get complacent and careless.
d_counseling_d_19_8,The slightest lapse in vigilance creates a window of opportunity for an assassin like me.
d_counseling_d_19_9,... Sloppy.
d_counseling_d_19_10,Why would you be that careless? You never know what could happen or how things might unfold when you're being targeted.
d_counseling_d_19_11,Don't ever forget that.
d_counseling_d_19_12,The slightest lapse in vigilance creates a window of opportunity for an assassin like me.
d_counseling_d_19_13,Always be on your guard.
d_counseling_d_19_14,I have a conversation with D about having a healthy wariness of strangers.
d_counseling_d_20_1,What do you find most admirable in a person?
d_counseling_d_20_2,The ability to clearly distinguish right from wrong.
d_counseling_d_20_3,"The ability to come off as cold, but in reality be quite gregarious."
d_counseling_d_20_4,Incredible.
d_counseling_d_20_5,It's as if you read my mind.
d_counseling_d_20_6,I'll have to use that line on my next mission.
d_counseling_d_20_7,...??
d_counseling_d_20_8,That's a rather... unique response.
d_counseling_d_20_9,"I'm not sure if I could use any of that in a future mission, but"
d_counseling_d_20_10,"I'll keep it in mind, I suppose."
d_counseling_d_20_11,D and I converse about the traits we find admirable in others.
d_counseling_rei_01_1,"Hey, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_01_2,What do you think I should do
d_counseling_rei_01_3,when I'm not feeling up to going to school?
d_counseling_rei_01_4,"It's okay to skip class once in a while, but don't make it a habit."
d_counseling_rei_01_5,"You're a third-year student now, so set an example for the younger ones."
d_counseling_rei_01_6,Really?
d_counseling_rei_01_7,"Hmm... now that you mention it,"
d_counseling_rei_01_8,skipping class doesn't seem so appealing.
d_counseling_rei_01_9,A model senior student never skips class!
d_counseling_rei_01_10,"I know, but..."
d_counseling_rei_01_11,is it really so bad to skip just one day?
d_counseling_rei_01_12,Even Naru agrees.
d_counseling_rei_01_13,Rei and I have a discussion about school.
d_counseling_rei_02_1,*Sob*
d_counseling_rei_02_2,Teacher... Naru... Naru...!
d_counseling_rei_02_3,Did Naru steal your snacks?
d_counseling_rei_02_4,Did Naru refuse to let you listen to music?
d_counseling_rei_02_5,*Sob* Yes...
d_counseling_rei_02_6,I didn't take it.
d_counseling_rei_02_7,Stop lying!
d_counseling_rei_02_8,"Teacher, please tell Naru off!"
d_counseling_rei_02_9,That was my one and only snack!
d_counseling_rei_02_10,*Hiccup* I'm not crying over that!
d_counseling_rei_02_11,Naru ate my snack.
d_counseling_rei_02_12,I didn't take it.
d_counseling_rei_02_13,You're lying! That was my one and only snack... *Sniffle*
d_counseling_rei_02_14,*Whimper* Ah-choo!
d_counseling_rei_02_15,I buy Rei some delicious snacks and spend some time with her.
d_counseling_rei_03_1,"Whoa, Teacher, you're like a giant!"
d_counseling_rei_03_2,I wish I could be as tall as you someday.
d_counseling_rei_03_3,Do you have any tips?
d_counseling_rei_03_4,That's not possible for someone like you.
d_counseling_rei_03_5,Drink milk every day and you might grow taller.
d_counseling_rei_03_6,What?!
d_counseling_rei_03_7,"That's so mean, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_03_8,Don't underestimate me!
d_counseling_rei_03_9,But I hate plain milk.
d_counseling_rei_03_10,How about chocolate milk?
d_counseling_rei_03_11,I could guzzle down 10 cartons a day.
d_counseling_rei_03_12,Rei and I do some research on how to grow taller.
d_counseling_rei_04_1,Now that I'm in my third year...
d_counseling_rei_04_2,I wanna be a super cool senior.
d_counseling_rei_04_3,What's the secret to being a great one?
d_counseling_rei_04_4,"You already are a great senior, Rei."
d_counseling_rei_04_5,Quit snacking for good.
d_counseling_rei_04_6,Hehehe.
d_counseling_rei_04_7,Hehehehe.
d_counseling_rei_04_8,"You really think so, Teacher?"
d_counseling_rei_04_9,I daresay Ein and Zwei feel the same way.
d_counseling_rei_04_10,What do snacks have to do with that anyway?
d_counseling_rei_04_11,...
d_counseling_rei_04_12,"... You don't have a clue about how to be a super cool senior, do you?"
d_counseling_rei_04_13,I'll ask Ein and Zwei instead.
d_counseling_rei_04_14,I discuss about what it takes to be a super cool senior with Rei.
d_counseling_rei_05_1,I got a test back today.
d_counseling_rei_05_2,I think I did pretty well.
d_counseling_rei_05_3,"Teacher, did you do well on tests back in your days?"
d_counseling_rei_05_4,I did better than you.
d_counseling_rei_05_5,I was the valedictorian.
d_counseling_rei_05_6,!!
d_counseling_rei_05_7,"How do you know that, Teacher?"
d_counseling_rei_05_8,Don't tell me... my report card is out already?!
d_counseling_rei_05_9,... What's my score? Can you give me a sneak peek?
d_counseling_rei_05_10,...
d_counseling_rei_05_11,...
d_counseling_rei_05_12,...
d_counseling_rei_05_13,...
d_counseling_rei_05_14,All of them wear expressions of disbelief.
d_counseling_rei_05_15,...
d_counseling_rei_05_16,"Guys, say something. Don't make Teacher nervous!"
d_counseling_rei_05_17,"I believe you, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_05_18,You're so inspiring!
d_counseling_rei_05_19,I have a chat about exams with Rei.
d_counseling_rei_06_1,...
d_counseling_rei_06_2,...
d_counseling_rei_06_3,... Are you feeling down due to puberty?
d_counseling_rei_06_4,Give her a piece of sweet chocolate.
d_counseling_rei_06_5,"No, not really."
d_counseling_rei_06_6,I just don't feel myself today.
d_counseling_rei_06_7,Perhaps some sweets will lift my spirits...
d_counseling_rei_06_8,...
d_counseling_rei_06_9,You sure you don't want it?
d_counseling_rei_06_10,"I want it! Thank you, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_06_11,Hehe. It looks even more delectable when it's from you.
d_counseling_rei_06_12,Rei and I savor some chocolates together and have a lovely time.
d_counseling_rei_07_1,"Naru and I will always have your back, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_07_2,We won't let anyone mess with you!
d_counseling_rei_07_3,"So, what do you think? Am I reliable?"
d_counseling_rei_07_4,Absolutely reliable.
d_counseling_rei_07_5,I'll protect you.
d_counseling_rei_07_6,Yes!
d_counseling_rei_07_7,"That's what senior students are supposed to be, right?"
d_counseling_rei_07_8,You can always count on me.
d_counseling_rei_07_9,"No, no, no! I'm a senior student now."
d_counseling_rei_07_10,"It's my job to protect you, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_07_11,I spend some meaningful time with Rei.
d_counseling_rei_08_1,"Teacher, the weather is lovely. Shall we take a stroll together?"
d_counseling_rei_08_2,We can indulge in all sorts of treats while we're out.
d_counseling_rei_08_3,"Plus, we can jam to some tunes!"
d_counseling_rei_08_4,You can't play music in public places.
d_counseling_rei_08_5,What kind of snacks should we get?
d_counseling_rei_08_6,I don't see the harm in playing music where there's no one else around.
d_counseling_rei_08_7,...
d_counseling_rei_08_8,Hmm... You're right. I can't act like I own the public space.
d_counseling_rei_08_9,"Can we still have some snacks, though?"
d_counseling_rei_08_10,!!
d_counseling_rei_08_11,We can buy any snacks we want? I want some chocolates and candies!
d_counseling_rei_08_12,Can I choose different types?
d_counseling_rei_08_13,Rei and I have a delightful conversation.
d_counseling_rei_09_1,Emperor penguins hate spinach♪ Ooh la la♪
d_counseling_rei_09_2,Too much fish and now my tummy aches♪ Ooh la la♪
d_counseling_rei_09_3,You should try eating spinach too.
d_counseling_rei_09_4,Emperor penguins hate spinach♪ Ooh la la♪
d_counseling_rei_09_5,What? But I'm just singing a song.
d_counseling_rei_09_6,And are you sure spinach is necessary for me?
d_counseling_rei_09_7,Eating spinach can make you grow taller.
d_counseling_rei_09_8,... I'll be adding spinach to my diet from now on.
d_counseling_rei_09_9,"Wow, I didn't know you could sing so well, Teacher!"
d_counseling_rei_09_10,"Hehe, how do you like my song?"
d_counseling_rei_09_11,It's my favorite one.
d_counseling_rei_09_12,I sing along with Rei and enjoy a fun time with her.
d_counseling_rei_10_1,Ahh...
d_counseling_rei_10_2,"Teacher, my teeth are throbbing."
d_counseling_rei_10_3,Let's get you to a dentist.
d_counseling_rei_10_4,No more snacks for you from now on.
d_counseling_rei_10_5,To the dentist?!
d_counseling_rei_10_6,But I don't want to...
d_counseling_rei_10_7,"Rei, you're a big girl."
d_counseling_rei_10_8,...
d_counseling_rei_10_9,"... All right, I'll be brave and set a good example."
d_counseling_rei_10_10,I'm not scared of dentists at all!
d_counseling_rei_10_11,...!!
d_counseling_rei_10_12,"No, Teacher! It's not that bad."
d_counseling_rei_10_13,I was just overreacting... ouch!
d_counseling_rei_10_14,I take Rei to the dentist for a check-up.
d_counseling_rei_11_1,"Teacher, check out what I brought! Snacks!"
d_counseling_rei_11_2,Wanna try some?
d_counseling_rei_11_3,"No thanks, I'm not hungry."
d_counseling_rei_11_4,"Sure thing, hand 'em over."
d_counseling_rei_11_5,"Oh... All right then,"
d_counseling_rei_11_6,I'll just eat 'em all myself!
d_counseling_rei_11_7,Nom nom nom.
d_counseling_rei_11_8,Here you go.
d_counseling_rei_11_9,Rei snatches the snack out of Naru's mouth and passes it to me.
d_counseling_rei_11_10,"Ew, there's Naru's saliva on it. But don't freak out! It's not technically saliva, so it's still edible."
d_counseling_rei_11_11,Rei and I then launch into a debate about the greatest snack ever made.
d_counseling_rei_12_1,Wouldn't it be amazing if Naru could do my homework for me?
d_counseling_rei_12_2,"I mean, it's a great idea, don't you think?"
d_counseling_rei_12_3,"Yeah, that would be awesome."
d_counseling_rei_12_4,So you haven't done your homework yet?
d_counseling_rei_12_5,"That's what I'm saying! That way, I could..."
d_counseling_rei_12_6,Naru could entertain your friends in your place.
d_counseling_rei_12_7,Huh?
d_counseling_rei_12_8,And Naru will wield the power of a third-year student on your behalf.
d_counseling_rei_12_9,What?
d_counseling_rei_12_10,"Eventually, Naru would take over your entire life."
d_counseling_rei_12_11,...
d_counseling_rei_12_12,I'm going to do my homework now.
d_counseling_rei_12_13,Not yet.
d_counseling_rei_12_14,Because the day isn't over.
d_counseling_rei_12_15,I'm going to start now.
d_counseling_rei_12_16,I stay with Rei and help her with her homework.
d_counseling_rei_13_1,*Huff* *Huff*
d_counseling_rei_13_2,Ein...! How dare she...! *Huff*
d_counseling_rei_13_3,That's completely unacceptable!
d_counseling_rei_13_4,Did Ein tell you to shape up as a senior?
d_counseling_rei_13_5,Did Ein ask you to clean the window frames?
d_counseling_rei_13_6,"No, it's not about that."
d_counseling_rei_13_7,But how could Ein say something like that...! Argh!
d_counseling_rei_13_8,She's really getting on my nerves!
d_counseling_rei_13_9,"... Wait, do I seem like an incompetent senior to you?"
d_counseling_rei_13_10,That's right!
d_counseling_rei_13_11,But cleaning the window frames is not a big deal.
d_counseling_rei_13_12,It's true but...
d_counseling_rei_13_13,Ein was being disrespectful and even snickering!
d_counseling_rei_13_14,I comfort Rei for a while.
d_counseling_rei_14_1,"Teacher, I have a question."
d_counseling_rei_14_2,What makes an ideal senior student?
d_counseling_rei_14_3,"You know, someone who can command respect and admiration for a long time."
d_counseling_rei_14_4,Someone who treats others to meals and snacks.
d_counseling_rei_14_5,Someone who isn't like Rei.
d_counseling_rei_14_6,"Treating others to meals and snacks, huh? Let me jot that down."
d_counseling_rei_14_7,"Hmm, I need to check my allowance this month..."
d_counseling_rei_14_8,"Okay, got it."
d_counseling_rei_14_9,Maybe I'll have to hold off on it.
d_counseling_rei_14_10,...
d_counseling_rei_14_11,...
d_counseling_rei_14_12,Just kidding.
d_counseling_rei_14_13,...
d_counseling_rei_14_14,Rei and I explore the attributes of an exceptional senior student.
d_counseling_rei_15_1,"These days, juniors are so disrespectful."
d_counseling_rei_15_2,They act like they're in charge and never follow instructions.
d_counseling_rei_15_3,*Sigh* I wasn't like that when I was their age.
d_counseling_rei_15_4,"How did you behave as a junior, Rei?"
d_counseling_rei_15_5,Juniors these days need to be put in their place.
d_counseling_rei_15_6,"Well, I used to argue a lot with those senior students."
d_counseling_rei_15_7,But I had a good reason for it.
d_counseling_rei_15_8,"Anyway, I'm not like them."
d_counseling_rei_15_9,... I see.
d_counseling_rei_15_10,Exactly!
d_counseling_rei_15_11,"... Uh, come to think of it,"
d_counseling_rei_15_12,I might have been the same way when I was a junior.
d_counseling_rei_15_13,Perhaps this is just the prevailing trend among students in that grade?
d_counseling_rei_15_14,Rei shares her struggles of managing her juniors with me.
d_counseling_rei_16_1,Ein and Zwei are the best.
d_counseling_rei_16_2,Hehe. You know why?
d_counseling_rei_16_3,Because they're your personal snack and homework assistants?
d_counseling_rei_16_4,Because they could keep you on your toes?
d_counseling_rei_16_5,"Yes, that's exactly what they do!"
d_counseling_rei_16_6,"Ein always knows what I'm craving,"
d_counseling_rei_16_7,and Zwei helps me with my assignments without even being asked.
d_counseling_rei_16_8,Why should I be?
d_counseling_rei_16_9,"I'm already a perfect senior student, you know."
d_counseling_rei_16_10,I don't really need that kind of help.
d_counseling_rei_16_11,I listen to Rei praise her juniors.
d_counseling_rei_17_1,"Teacher, which one of the Narus do you prefer?"
d_counseling_rei_17_2,"This is 1, this is 2, and this is 3."
d_counseling_rei_17_3,"Honestly, they all look the same to me."
d_counseling_rei_17_4,Naru 3...?
d_counseling_rei_17_5,Beep!
d_counseling_rei_17_6,Creak!
d_counseling_rei_17_7,Pfft!
d_counseling_rei_17_8,"... Sorry, my bad."
d_counseling_rei_17_9,!!
d_counseling_rei_17_10,Hehe. I see.
d_counseling_rei_17_11,"Naru 3 also has a fondness for you, Teacher."
d_counseling_rei_17_12,"I listen to Rei praise Naru 1, 2, and 3."
d_counseling_rei_18_1,Battles aren't really my thing.
d_counseling_rei_18_2,They're a bit daunting.
d_counseling_rei_18_3,"How about you, Teacher?"
d_counseling_rei_18_4,I find them a bit scary too.
d_counseling_rei_18_5,It's fine once I got used to them.
d_counseling_rei_18_6,"So you also have a bit of fear, Teacher."
d_counseling_rei_18_7,But you carry on with it because...
d_counseling_rei_18_8,"it's worth the risk, right?"
d_counseling_rei_18_9,So you could gradually build up your courage.
d_counseling_rei_18_10,I don't think I'll ever be brave enough like you.
d_counseling_rei_18_11,I provide some comfort to Rei about her concerns.
d_counseling_rei_19_1,... I got screwed.
d_counseling_rei_19_2,I didn't expect a pop quiz!
d_counseling_rei_19_3,And it's the subject I'm worst at.
d_counseling_rei_19_4,Are you going to clean the bathroom starting tomorrow?
d_counseling_rei_19_5,"I bet you still did pretty well, right?"
d_counseling_rei_19_6,...
d_counseling_rei_19_7,"Teacher, can I ask you for a favor?"
d_counseling_rei_19_8,I won't be scrubbing any toilets for you.
d_counseling_rei_19_9,... Okay.
d_counseling_rei_19_10,Hehe.
d_counseling_rei_19_11,Let's just say I didn't let it defeat me.
d_counseling_rei_19_12,"Even though I flunked the quiz, I still feel like I won mentally."
d_counseling_rei_19_13,Rei and I talk about strategies for tackling pop quizzes.
d_counseling_rei_20_1,Teacher! Here!
d_counseling_rei_20_2,Rei holds out her clenched fist.
d_counseling_rei_20_3,I got something for you.
d_counseling_rei_20_4,Accept her gift.
d_counseling_rei_20_5,Decline her gift.
d_counseling_rei_20_6,Rei opens her hand to reveal a candy.
d_counseling_rei_20_7,I managed to chance upon this incredibly rare candy and held it tightly in my hand to bring to you.
d_counseling_rei_20_8,"It may not be the best-tasting candy, but it's definitely a rare treat."
d_counseling_rei_20_9,"Thank you, Rei."
d_counseling_rei_20_10,"Teacher, what's wrong? You have a guilty look on your face."
d_counseling_rei_20_11,You don't want it?
d_counseling_rei_20_12,Uh... Why?
d_counseling_rei_20_13,This candy is really unique...
d_counseling_rei_20_14,"Rei and I play rock, paper, scissors for a while."
d_counseling_dorothy_01_1,What drives you to fight?
d_counseling_dorothy_01_2,What's the point of reclaiming the surface?
d_counseling_dorothy_01_3,All I want is for everyone to be happy.
d_counseling_dorothy_01_4,I want to bring an end to this war.
d_counseling_dorothy_01_5,Happiness...
d_counseling_dorothy_01_6,even in the midst of such turmoil.
d_counseling_dorothy_01_7,You remind me of someone I know.
d_counseling_dorothy_01_8,Just like that?
d_counseling_dorothy_01_9,Do you honestly believe it's possible to put an end to this conflict?
d_counseling_dorothy_01_10,How... optimistic.
d_counseling_dorothy_01_11,"And yet, also worrisome."
d_counseling_dorothy_01_12,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_1,I heard you spent a fair amount of time on the surface.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_2,Have you ever tried your hand at skinning a deer?
d_counseling_dorothy_02_3,"No, but I have an idea of how it's done."
d_counseling_dorothy_02_4,"Actually, I've never even come across a deer."
d_counseling_dorothy_02_5,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_6,"If you ever get the chance to try it, you'll be surprised at how easy it is."
d_counseling_dorothy_02_7,"A deer has a lot of meat, which is great for sharing."
d_counseling_dorothy_02_8,You can share it with... your comrades.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_9,That's understandable.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_10,Living beings are a rare sight on the surface.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_11,Perhaps you'll have a chance to see one in the future.
d_counseling_dorothy_02_12,Dorothy shares some insights about deer with me.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_1,Do you find Eden's food to your liking?
d_counseling_dorothy_03_2,I assume it's quite different from the cuisine in the Ark.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_3,It's a heavenly delight.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_4,"It's delicious, but not very convenient."
d_counseling_dorothy_03_5,I knew you would love it.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_6,Please indulge yourself while you're here.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_7,"After all, culinary creations are Eden's pride and joy."
d_counseling_dorothy_03_8,Convenience isn't always a top priority when it comes to food.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_9,It can be detrimental to your quality of life.
d_counseling_dorothy_03_10,"Well, since I'm not the one eating, there's no need to fuss too much about it."
d_counseling_dorothy_03_11,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy about food.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_1,What's your impression of the Ark?
d_counseling_dorothy_04_2,I'm interested to hear your perspective.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_3,It's a good place to live.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_4,It has its flaws.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_5,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_6,It seems like a place worth protecting.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_7,What a pity.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_8,Is that so?
d_counseling_dorothy_04_9,"Even after all this time, it still has issues."
d_counseling_dorothy_04_10,What a sad place.
d_counseling_dorothy_04_11,I have a conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_05_1,Isabel seems quite fond of you.
d_counseling_dorothy_05_2,"But be careful, she's more dangerous than she seems."
d_counseling_dorothy_05_3,"Yeah, I know."
d_counseling_dorothy_05_4,How so?
d_counseling_dorothy_05_5,So you're already aware of her nature.
d_counseling_dorothy_05_6,That's good to hear.
d_counseling_dorothy_05_7,"Once Isabel sets her mind on something, she can be quite persistent."
d_counseling_dorothy_05_8,"But don't worry, she won't cause any trouble for you."
d_counseling_dorothy_05_9,"As a cherished guest of Eden, you are highly valued."
d_counseling_dorothy_05_10,Dorothy and I have a conversation about Isabel.
d_counseling_dorothy_06_1,How do you view the world around us?
d_counseling_dorothy_06_2,Do you think it's fair or unfair?
d_counseling_dorothy_06_3,It's fair.
d_counseling_dorothy_06_4,It's unfair.
d_counseling_dorothy_06_5,Really?
d_counseling_dorothy_06_6,"There are people who suffer in this world, who get sent to the frontlines,"
d_counseling_dorothy_06_7,"and those who think they're in paradise when they're actually living underground, continuing their despicable lives."
d_counseling_dorothy_06_8,But you still believe it's a fair world.
d_counseling_dorothy_06_9,I completely agree.
d_counseling_dorothy_06_10,"If the world was fair, everyone would be living in their own paradise, wouldn't they?"
d_counseling_dorothy_06_11,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_1,Do you believe in the idea of karma?
d_counseling_dorothy_07_2,That actions have consequences and people who do bad things will eventually get what's coming to them.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_3,"Yes, I think it's true."
d_counseling_dorothy_07_4,It's hard to say.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_5,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_6,"However, the wretched scum always manage to escape their just desserts."
d_counseling_dorothy_07_7,That's a realistic answer.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_8,The unfortunate truth is that not everyone can be punished for their wrongdoings.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_9,... That's why I can't stop myself.
d_counseling_dorothy_07_10,Dorothy and I discuss a bitter topic.
d_counseling_dorothy_08_1,I heard you're known as Mankind's Hope in the Ark.
d_counseling_dorothy_08_2,How does it feel to carry the hopes of everyone in the Ark?
d_counseling_dorothy_08_3,It feels like a heavy burden.
d_counseling_dorothy_08_4,It's motivating.
d_counseling_dorothy_08_5,"I can imagine it weighs heavily on you. And yet, you're persevering."
d_counseling_dorothy_08_6,"But remember, with the weight of hope comes the burden of revenge."
d_counseling_dorothy_08_7,"If someone betrays you, you must repay the same weight of betrayal."
d_counseling_dorothy_08_8,"I see, your optimism is just... admirable."
d_counseling_dorothy_08_9,But don't let it get to your head.
d_counseling_dorothy_08_10,"Remember, the opposite of hope is betrayal."
d_counseling_dorothy_08_11,I have a sincere conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_09_1,How's life treating you in Eden?
d_counseling_dorothy_09_2,Are you all comfortable?
d_counseling_dorothy_09_3,"It's absolutely perfect, I couldn't ask for more."
d_counseling_dorothy_09_4,"It's not ideal, I feel suffocated at times."
d_counseling_dorothy_09_5,That's great to hear.
d_counseling_dorothy_09_6,But I suppose those from the Ark won't be pleased to hear that.
d_counseling_dorothy_09_7,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_09_8,The amenities and meals here are impeccable.
d_counseling_dorothy_09_9,Maybe it's a matter of your mindset?
d_counseling_dorothy_09_10,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_1,"Noah is quite endearing, isn't she?"
d_counseling_dorothy_10_2,And she's so obedient.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_3,...?!
d_counseling_dorothy_10_4,I-I suppose so.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_5,"Hehe, I can tell you're surprised."
d_counseling_dorothy_10_6,I know Noah's true nature when she's with other people.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_7,You don't have to agree just to please me.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_8,I know Noah's personality inside out.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_9,And that's why it's especially adorable when she listens to me.
d_counseling_dorothy_10_10,Dorothy and I chat about Noah.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_1,You seem to have a close relationship with the Nikkes by your side.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_2,"If I may ask, how do you see them?"
d_counseling_dorothy_11_3,They're my comrades in life and death.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_4,They're like family to me.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_5,I see. It's clear that you're willing to put your life on the line for them.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_6,Your bond with your comrades is truly...
d_counseling_dorothy_11_7,admirable.
d_counseling_dorothy_11_8,Family?
d_counseling_dorothy_11_9,"I'm sorry, but I don't see how humans and Nikkes can be considered family."
d_counseling_dorothy_11_10,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_1,We discovered three Nikkes on the surface again today.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_2,... It's distressing.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_3,What is their condition?
d_counseling_dorothy_12_4,Did you see them off properly?
d_counseling_dorothy_12_5,... Condition?
d_counseling_dorothy_12_6,"Unfortunately, the Nikkes we come across in this area are already beyond saving."
d_counseling_dorothy_12_7,We make sure to pay our respects and offer them a dignified farewell.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_8,Yes.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_9,... I have faith that they have moved on to a better place.
d_counseling_dorothy_12_10,Dorothy and I discuss a sobering topic.
d_counseling_dorothy_13_1,*Sigh*
d_counseling_dorothy_13_2,I haven't had a nightmare in ages. It feels awful.
d_counseling_dorothy_13_3,Did you dream about ghosts?
d_counseling_dorothy_13_4,Did you dream about falling from the Elevator?
d_counseling_dorothy_13_5,Ghosts...
d_counseling_dorothy_13_6,"I suppose it would be nice if I could see her again,"
d_counseling_dorothy_13_7,even if only in my dreams.
d_counseling_dorothy_13_8,"Hehe, it looks like you have those nightmares often."
d_counseling_dorothy_13_9,I'm a little envious.
d_counseling_dorothy_13_10,My nightmares are more complicated than that.
d_counseling_dorothy_13_11,Dorothy and I have a conversation about dreams.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_1,You're always up so early.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_2,Don't you ever want to sleep in?
d_counseling_dorothy_14_3,I guess it's because this isn't my home.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_4,Maybe I'm feeling a bit anxious.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_5,"I'm a bit surprised that you're still struggling to sleep in new places, given that you're always up on the surface for missions."
d_counseling_dorothy_14_6,"... Well, it's always nice to have a home to come back to."
d_counseling_dorothy_14_7,I hope it's not because of me.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_8,"If you're having trouble sleeping in this environment, we can make changes to accommodate you."
d_counseling_dorothy_14_9,But I'm afraid replacing me isn't an option.
d_counseling_dorothy_14_10,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_15_1,Do you have an appreciation for flowers?
d_counseling_dorothy_15_2,There are beautiful white lilies blooming in the patio. We should go check them out later.
d_counseling_dorothy_15_3,What's the scent of lilies like?
d_counseling_dorothy_15_4,What do lilies look like?
d_counseling_dorothy_15_5,They have a rich fragrance.
d_counseling_dorothy_15_6,"No matter where they are, the aroma they leave behind is potent."
d_counseling_dorothy_15_7,"In fact, their scent is still lingering on me now."
d_counseling_dorothy_15_8,"They're pure white flowers,"
d_counseling_dorothy_15_9,and their petals spread outwards.
d_counseling_dorothy_15_10,Dorothy and I converse about lilies.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_1,I heard you called for me.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_2,Is there anything you need?
d_counseling_dorothy_16_3,I just wanted to chat with you.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_4,I have a question for you.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_5,"A chat, you say?"
d_counseling_dorothy_16_6,That's... unexpected.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_7,It's been a while since I've had a leisurely conversation.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_8,"Certainly, what's on your mind?"
d_counseling_dorothy_16_9,I'm willing to answer any questions as long as they do not breach any security protocols.
d_counseling_dorothy_16_10,I have a chat with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_1,"I'm curious to know,"
d_counseling_dorothy_17_2,do you think Eden has any flaws?
d_counseling_dorothy_17_3,No. It's perfect.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_4,It's missing a certain warmth.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_5,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_6,"So, in your eyes,"
d_counseling_dorothy_17_7,this is what paradise truly means.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_8,The heating system is functioning properly.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_9,Are you referring to the warmth in personal relationships?
d_counseling_dorothy_17_10,... I'm quite intrigued as to what kind of warmth you're talking about.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_11,I haven't felt that in a long time.
d_counseling_dorothy_17_12,Dorothy and I have a discussion about Eden.
d_counseling_dorothy_18_1,"I'm feeling curious, so I have a question for you."
d_counseling_dorothy_18_2,Do you think we can reclaim the surface?
d_counseling_dorothy_18_3,I think it's achievable.
d_counseling_dorothy_18_4,I'm not entirely certain.
d_counseling_dorothy_18_5,You sound pretty confident.
d_counseling_dorothy_18_6,"With you here, I believe we have a chance at success."
d_counseling_dorothy_18_7,...
d_counseling_dorothy_18_8,Putting your life on the line for something uncertain?
d_counseling_dorothy_18_9,That takes real courage.
d_counseling_dorothy_18_10,I have a brief conversation with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_1,I personally designed the room you're staying in.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_2,What do you think of it?
d_counseling_dorothy_19_3,Pink seems to be your favorite color.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_4,I appreciate the subtle touches of pink.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_5,Yes.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_6,I suppose I do have a thing for pink.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_7,"But out of all the other colors, you mentioned pink. I suppose it's not to your taste?"
d_counseling_dorothy_19_8,Thank you for the feedback.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_9,I try to incorporate pink in subtle ways so that it doesn't overwhelm the room's aesthetic.
d_counseling_dorothy_19_10,Dorothy and I chat about pink.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_1,Isn't the weather lovely today?
d_counseling_dorothy_20_2,Do you have a favorite type of weather?
d_counseling_dorothy_20_3,I enjoy sunny and warm weather.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_4,I prefer rainy and cool weather.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_5,I like sunny days too.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_6,"When I sit under my parasol and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin,"
d_counseling_dorothy_20_7,it's like all my troubles just melt away.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_8,So you're a fan of rainy days.
d_counseling_dorothy_20_9,"Personally, I much prefer sunny days."
d_counseling_dorothy_20_10,Dorothy and I have a conversation about weather.
d_counseling_noir_01_1,Pit Boss...
d_counseling_noir_01_2,How do you think Blanc manages to be so charming all the time?
d_counseling_noir_01_3,Because of her lively personality.
d_counseling_noir_01_4,"Personally, I think you're much more adorable."
d_counseling_noir_01_5,Wow!
d_counseling_noir_01_6,You knew immediately what your answer was going to be.
d_counseling_noir_01_7,That's amazing.
d_counseling_noir_01_8,Um...
d_counseling_noir_01_9,"I appreciate you saying that,"
d_counseling_noir_01_10,"but it's Blanc that I want to discuss, not me."
d_counseling_noir_01_11,I know you were saying that just to make me feel better...
d_counseling_noir_01_12,Noir and I chat about Blanc's allure for a while.
d_counseling_noir_02_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_noir_02_2,people always look at me when I pass by them.
d_counseling_noir_02_3,It's really embarrassing... why do you think they do that?
d_counseling_noir_02_4,Because your outfit stands out a fair bit.
d_counseling_noir_02_5,Because you're so pretty.
d_counseling_noir_02_6,I knew it.
d_counseling_noir_02_7,"I wear this same outfit every day, but I still haven't gotten used to it."
d_counseling_noir_02_8,?!
d_counseling_noir_02_9,Th-that can't be it!
d_counseling_noir_02_10,"Oh jeez, now I'm even more embarrassed..."
d_counseling_noir_02_11,I have a brief chat with Noir.
d_counseling_noir_03_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_noir_03_2,will you be coming to the show tonight?
d_counseling_noir_03_3,"Yes, I will."
d_counseling_noir_03_4,"Sorry, I don't have time."
d_counseling_noir_03_5,Oh man...
d_counseling_noir_03_6,I've been slacking off with my practice lately.
d_counseling_noir_03_7,"If you come, I'm afraid I'll get all nervous and end up making mistakes."
d_counseling_noir_03_8,But I'll try my best!
d_counseling_noir_03_9,Whoo!
d_counseling_noir_03_10,That's a relief.
d_counseling_noir_03_11,I haven't been practicing much recently.
d_counseling_noir_03_12,"If you came, I'd be a nervous wreck and mess up my performance. You not coming is a blessing in disguise."
d_counseling_noir_03_13,I'll make sure to be prepared for you next time!
d_counseling_noir_03_14,I chat a little more with Noir about tonight's show.
d_counseling_noir_04_1,I always get so nervous before I go on stage. It's debilitating.
d_counseling_noir_04_2,How can I get over it?
d_counseling_noir_04_3,Think of me.
d_counseling_noir_04_4,Think about Blanc.
d_counseling_noir_04_5,Uh...
d_counseling_noir_04_6,I don't think I can.
d_counseling_noir_04_7,That'll only make me more nervous...
d_counseling_noir_04_8,*Sign*
d_counseling_noir_04_9,B-Blanc...?
d_counseling_noir_04_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_noir_04_11,"Hey, that does seem to calm me down a bit!"
d_counseling_noir_04_12,"Thanks, Pit Boss!"
d_counseling_noir_04_13,I chat with Noir about how to deal with stage fright.
d_counseling_noir_05_1,Pit Boss!
d_counseling_noir_05_2,Have you ever heard of the carrot song?
d_counseling_noir_05_3,"C'mon bunny, hop to it! Catch the carrot!"
d_counseling_noir_05_4,What is that?
d_counseling_noir_05_5,"So you know the lyrics, too?"
d_counseling_noir_05_6,That's awesome.
d_counseling_noir_05_7,I didn't know them until Blanc told me.
d_counseling_noir_05_8,I guess I'm slow catching up with the newest trends...
d_counseling_noir_05_9,No way!
d_counseling_noir_05_10,You don't know?
d_counseling_noir_05_11,"Actually, I didn't know about it either, not until Blanc told me."
d_counseling_noir_05_12,"C'mon bunny, hop to it! Catch the carrot!"
d_counseling_noir_05_13,That's how it starts.
d_counseling_noir_05_14,Noir and I recite more of the lyrics to the carrot song.
d_counseling_noir_06_1,What do you think is the most alluring part of pole dancing?
d_counseling_noir_06_2,I've been having a hard time with it recently.
d_counseling_noir_06_3,It's both elegant and sexy.
d_counseling_noir_06_4,The exquisite postures and technique.
d_counseling_noir_06_5,E-elegant and sexy?
d_counseling_noir_06_6,Those words don't seem to quite suit me...
d_counseling_noir_06_7,How exactly do I bring out that side of myself?
d_counseling_noir_06_8,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_noir_06_9,Pole dancing is all about pulling off one eye-catching pose after the other.
d_counseling_noir_06_10,And the technique required to string them all together is crucial.
d_counseling_noir_06_11,"Thanks for helping me see the light, Pit Boss!"
d_counseling_noir_06_12,I chat with Noir about pole dancing for a while.
d_counseling_noir_07_1,People call me and Blanc the lucky bunny twins.
d_counseling_noir_07_2,But what if something unfortunate happens to me?
d_counseling_noir_07_3,Then you'll be downgraded to a semi-lucky bunny.
d_counseling_noir_07_4,Then your luck will have run out.
d_counseling_noir_07_5,Will I?
d_counseling_noir_07_6,I appreciate your candor...
d_counseling_noir_07_7,"Then again, I guess a semi-lucky bunny still counts as lucky."
d_counseling_noir_07_8,Works for me!
d_counseling_noir_07_9,You mean I'd be all out of luck?!
d_counseling_noir_07_10,Where would I have to go to fill it back up again?
d_counseling_noir_07_11,What if I run out of it on an important day?
d_counseling_noir_07_12,Noir and I chat about luck for a while.
d_counseling_noir_08_1,Have you ever seen a real bunny?
d_counseling_noir_08_2,I've seen the photos. They're so adorable!
d_counseling_noir_08_3,"Yes, I have."
d_counseling_noir_08_4,"No, I haven't."
d_counseling_noir_08_5,No kidding!
d_counseling_noir_08_6,Do they look like they do in the photos?
d_counseling_noir_08_7,Are they really like teeny-tiny cotton balls with ears?
d_counseling_noir_08_8,"Yeah, I guess it's uncommon to come across real animals."
d_counseling_noir_08_9,I'm curious if their ears really stick out like in the photos.
d_counseling_noir_08_10,If only I could see one with my own eyes.
d_counseling_noir_08_11,I chat with Noir about bunnies for a while.
d_counseling_noir_09_1,Rouge was in a foul mood today 'cause her coin landed tails side up.
d_counseling_noir_09_2,"To her, it's a bad omen meaning she'll have rotten luck for the rest of the day."
d_counseling_noir_09_3,Are there any things that you consider to be bad luck?
d_counseling_noir_09_4,I don't think so.
d_counseling_noir_09_5,I'm only unlucky that I don't get to see you every day.
d_counseling_noir_09_6,That's nice.
d_counseling_noir_09_7,Then you must be a pretty lucky guy!
d_counseling_noir_09_8,"If you did have something, you'd end up obsessing over it every day like Rouge does."
d_counseling_noir_09_9,...!!
d_counseling_noir_09_10,Don't be silly!
d_counseling_noir_09_11,...
d_counseling_noir_09_12,Do you really mean that?
d_counseling_noir_09_13,Noir and I talk more about bad omens.
d_counseling_noir_10_1,"Pit Boss, I'm sorry..."
d_counseling_noir_10_2,"I've got pole dancing practice today, so I've got to leave early."
d_counseling_noir_10_3,"No problem, we can reschedule for another time."
d_counseling_noir_10_4,"Sorry, but you can't leave until we finish our session."
d_counseling_noir_10_5,Oh!
d_counseling_noir_10_6,Thanks for being so understanding.
d_counseling_noir_10_7,Our next counseling session can go on for a little longer!
d_counseling_noir_10_8,But...
d_counseling_noir_10_9,Blanc will have to wait for me...
d_counseling_noir_10_10,"Can't you make an exception, just this once?"
d_counseling_noir_10_11,I let the anxious-looking Noir leave early.
d_counseling_noir_11_1,"Dogs go ""woof""."
d_counseling_noir_11_2,"Cats go ""meow""."
d_counseling_noir_11_3,And rabbits go...
d_counseling_noir_11_4,"... ""Bunny, bunny""?"
d_counseling_noir_11_5,"... ""Goo goo gah gah""?"
d_counseling_noir_11_6,...
d_counseling_noir_11_7,I'm not so sure about that...
d_counseling_noir_11_8,Bingo!
d_counseling_noir_11_9,That's what I think they sound like too.
d_counseling_noir_11_10,"Although I'm not 100% sure, to be honest..."
d_counseling_noir_11_11,I chat with Noir about what sounds bunnies make.
d_counseling_noir_12_1,What's the easiest way to make friends?
d_counseling_noir_12_2,I'm always cripplingly shy whenever I meet people for the first time.
d_counseling_noir_12_3,Start with some small talk.
d_counseling_noir_12_4,Find a topic that you're both interested in.
d_counseling_noir_12_5,Small talk?
d_counseling_noir_12_6,How do I do that?
d_counseling_noir_12_7,It's hard to strike up a conversation without a topic...
d_counseling_noir_12_8,"Hey, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_noir_12_9,"So, you and I could talk about Blanc, for example?"
d_counseling_noir_12_10,We'll be fast friends in that case!
d_counseling_noir_12_11,I chat with Noir about how to make friends.
d_counseling_noir_13_1,I think my hair is too long. Sometimes it gets in the way when I'm pole dancing.
d_counseling_noir_13_2,Do you think I should get it trimmed?
d_counseling_noir_13_3,It's beautiful as is.
d_counseling_noir_13_4,How about tying it up?
d_counseling_noir_13_5,You think so?
d_counseling_noir_13_6,... Thanks.
d_counseling_noir_13_7,"I guess I'll bear with it then, even if it may hinder my performance."
d_counseling_noir_13_8,Ooh!
d_counseling_noir_13_9,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_noir_13_10,I'll tie it up next time I perform.
d_counseling_noir_13_11,"Thank you, Pit Boss."
d_counseling_noir_13_12,I chat with Noir about hairstyles that are best suited for the stage.
d_counseling_noir_14_1,Um...
d_counseling_noir_14_2,...
d_counseling_noir_14_3,I... I...
d_counseling_noir_14_4,Wait until Noir finishes talking.
d_counseling_noir_14_5,Ask Noir what's the matter.
d_counseling_noir_14_6,...
d_counseling_noir_14_7,D-do...
d_counseling_noir_14_8,... Do you want to go for a walk in the park with me?!
d_counseling_noir_14_9,Phew... I finally said it.
d_counseling_noir_14_10,You okay?
d_counseling_noir_14_11,!!!
d_counseling_noir_14_12,N-no!
d_counseling_noir_14_13,Nothing's wrong... erm...
d_counseling_noir_14_14,I spend a short counseling session with Noir.
d_counseling_noir_15_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_noir_15_2,did you come to Coin Rush yesterday?
d_counseling_noir_15_3,"Yes, I did."
d_counseling_noir_15_4,"No, I was in the Commander's Room."
d_counseling_noir_15_5,So it was you that I saw!
d_counseling_noir_15_6,"I couldn't make you out clearly from where I was on the stage,"
d_counseling_noir_15_7,but I was sure that I'd seen someone who looked just like you.
d_counseling_noir_15_8,"Oh, okay..."
d_counseling_noir_15_9,I thought I saw you in the audience when I was on stage yesterday.
d_counseling_noir_15_10,"The audience usually isn't well-lit, so I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me."
d_counseling_noir_15_11,I have a good counseling session with Noir.
d_counseling_noir_16_1,I feel like today is an especially auspicious day.
d_counseling_noir_16_2,Can I share my luck with you?
d_counseling_noir_16_3,Hold out my hand.
d_counseling_noir_16_4,Lean my face in closer.
d_counseling_noir_16_5,"I'll just give a little handshake, and..."
d_counseling_noir_16_6,Lucky recharge!
d_counseling_noir_16_7,...
d_counseling_noir_16_8,Are you feeling lucky?
d_counseling_noir_16_9,Uh...
d_counseling_noir_16_10,Why are you leaning in so close?
d_counseling_noir_16_11,Y-you're making me uncomfortable!
d_counseling_noir_16_12,"Once our counseling wraps up, Noir fills up my luck."
d_counseling_noir_17_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_noir_17_2,"do you prefer curvier girls, or slimmer girls?"
d_counseling_noir_17_3,I prefer curvier girls.
d_counseling_noir_17_4,I like both.
d_counseling_noir_17_5,I... I see!
d_counseling_noir_17_6,Um...
d_counseling_noir_17_7,So you don't like slim girls at all?
d_counseling_noir_17_8,Oh!
d_counseling_noir_17_9,You like them both?
d_counseling_noir_17_10,... That's great!
d_counseling_noir_17_11,I had a good time with Noir.
d_counseling_noir_18_1,"The more I look at Blanc, the more adorable I find her."
d_counseling_noir_18_2,I want to be just like her...
d_counseling_noir_18_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_noir_18_4,Try on a white bunny costume.
d_counseling_noir_18_5,You're twins. You two are very similar.
d_counseling_noir_18_6,Hm...
d_counseling_noir_18_7,Do you think I'll look like Blanc if I dress like that?
d_counseling_noir_18_8,What if people make jokes about me?
d_counseling_noir_18_9,R-really?
d_counseling_noir_18_10,...
d_counseling_noir_18_11,You're right. I can't become her just because I want to.
d_counseling_noir_18_12,I am already happy that we're twins.
d_counseling_noir_18_13,Noir and I chat about Blanc for a while.
d_counseling_noir_19_1,"Besides the bunny costume I usually wear,"
d_counseling_noir_19_2,can you recommend any other outfits?
d_counseling_noir_19_3,Something less formal.
d_counseling_noir_19_4,A hoodie and jeans.
d_counseling_noir_19_5,A swimsuit.
d_counseling_noir_19_6,I don't know...
d_counseling_noir_19_7,Blanc said that hoodies aren't a good fit for me.
d_counseling_noir_19_8,"She said it'd make my chest look, to quote her, ""obscenely ginormous""."
d_counseling_noir_19_9,Anything else?
d_counseling_noir_19_10,A swimsuit?
d_counseling_noir_19_11,Um...
d_counseling_noir_19_12,I don't think that'd be appropriate for pole dancing.
d_counseling_noir_19_13,I guess it is a bit more casual than a bunny costume though.
d_counseling_noir_19_14,I chat with Noir about clothes for a while.
d_counseling_noir_20_1,Pit Boss!
d_counseling_noir_20_2,Blanc and I just finished up today's lucky draw.
d_counseling_noir_20_3,Would you like to try?
d_counseling_noir_20_4,Draw once.
d_counseling_noir_20_5,Draw twice.
d_counseling_noir_20_6,Wow!
d_counseling_noir_20_7,Today will be a super lucky day for you.
d_counseling_noir_20_8,Congratulations!
d_counseling_noir_20_9,Uh oh...
d_counseling_noir_20_10,"Unfortunately, today is an unlucky day for you..."
d_counseling_noir_20_11,B-but don't worry!
d_counseling_noir_20_12,I-I'm right here...
d_counseling_noir_20_13,Noir and I talk more about today's fortune.
d_counseling_blanc_01_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_blanc_01_2,have you seen Noir?
d_counseling_blanc_01_3,"I fell asleep, and when I woke up, she was gone."
d_counseling_blanc_01_4,I can't get in touch with her either...
d_counseling_blanc_01_5,Maybe she went out on a date.
d_counseling_blanc_01_6,Maybe she left to practice pole dancing.
d_counseling_blanc_01_7,Noir? On a date?
d_counseling_blanc_01_8,That's impossible.
d_counseling_blanc_01_9,I have to go find her right away.
d_counseling_blanc_01_10,"Hmm, could be."
d_counseling_blanc_01_11,Noir has been practicing hard for the performance recently.
d_counseling_blanc_01_12,I should go check out the practice room.
d_counseling_blanc_01_13,Wanna go with me?
d_counseling_blanc_01_14,Blanc and I leave to look for Noir.
d_counseling_blanc_02_1,"Pit Boss,"
d_counseling_blanc_02_2,What do you think is the best way for me to transmit happiness?
d_counseling_blanc_02_3,By holding hands.
d_counseling_blanc_02_4,"Any method is fine, as long as it brings luck."
d_counseling_blanc_02_5,Indeed...
d_counseling_blanc_02_6,Blanc holds my hand.
d_counseling_blanc_02_7,I should have known that holding hands was the best method!
d_counseling_blanc_02_8,The best part is that we can do this all day.
d_counseling_blanc_02_9,Could you... be more specific?
d_counseling_blanc_02_10,I wanna find the best way to make you happy.
d_counseling_blanc_02_11,"Throughout my entire session with Blanc, I feel elated."
d_counseling_blanc_03_1,Um... Pit Boss.
d_counseling_blanc_03_2,Could Noir come with me to our next session?
d_counseling_blanc_03_3,It feels kinda lonely when I do it on my own.
d_counseling_blanc_03_4,Counseling sessions are supposed to be one-on-one.
d_counseling_blanc_03_5,"If that's what you want, go for it."
d_counseling_blanc_03_6,... I see.
d_counseling_blanc_03_7,That's too bad... I think it'd be fun to have Noir join.
d_counseling_blanc_03_8,"Cool, I'll talk to Noir about it!"
d_counseling_blanc_03_9,The three of us can hang out afterwards...
d_counseling_blanc_03_10,... in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_blanc_03_11,I have a meaningful session with Blanc.
d_counseling_blanc_04_1,I think Noir is the prettiest and most beautiful existence in this world.
d_counseling_blanc_04_2,What do you think?
d_counseling_blanc_04_3,"You're awfully pretty yourself, Blanc."
d_counseling_blanc_04_4,I agree.
d_counseling_blanc_04_5,Hehe.
d_counseling_blanc_04_6,"Thanks, but I still think Noir is prettier than me."
d_counseling_blanc_04_7,"I'm happy that you feel that way, though!"
d_counseling_blanc_04_8,!!
d_counseling_blanc_04_9,You think so too?
d_counseling_blanc_04_10,I should have known we'd feel the same way about this.
d_counseling_blanc_04_11,If only I was half as pretty as Noir...
d_counseling_blanc_04_12,I talk to Blanc about Noir.
d_counseling_blanc_05_1,"Sometimes, Rouge gets a bit blue because of her superstitions."
d_counseling_blanc_05_2,Any idea on how we can help her?
d_counseling_blanc_05_3,We can't help someone who can't help themselves.
d_counseling_blanc_05_4,You should hold her hand.
d_counseling_blanc_05_5,That makes sense...
d_counseling_blanc_05_6,but surely it'd be easier for her if we lent a hand?
d_counseling_blanc_05_7,That's a good idea.
d_counseling_blanc_05_8,Noir and I are always around Rouge.
d_counseling_blanc_05_9,"Whenever she's feeling down,"
d_counseling_blanc_05_10,we'll nuzzle up to her and hold her hand.
d_counseling_blanc_05_11,"That way, we'll get her out of her funk in no time."
d_counseling_blanc_05_12,Blac and I talk about ways to help alleviate Rouge's melancholy.
d_counseling_blanc_06_1,I have a question!
d_counseling_blanc_06_2,"What's your favorite type of girl, Pit Boss?"
d_counseling_blanc_06_3,Someone vivacious.
d_counseling_blanc_06_4,Someone taciturn.
d_counseling_blanc_06_5,In other words...
d_counseling_blanc_06_6,Someone like me!
d_counseling_blanc_06_7,"Actually, you're my type as well, Pit Boss..."
d_counseling_blanc_06_8,"Oh, so you like quiet girls?"
d_counseling_blanc_06_9,"Someone like Noir, then?"
d_counseling_blanc_06_10,Noir is as quiet as they come.
d_counseling_blanc_06_11,Blanc and I talk about what we look for in a partner.
d_counseling_blanc_07_1,There are times when we come across rude customers.
d_counseling_blanc_07_2,How do you think we should handle them?
d_counseling_blanc_07_3,Treat them the same way they treat you.
d_counseling_blanc_07_4,Let me take care of them.
d_counseling_blanc_07_5,No way!
d_counseling_blanc_07_6,"At that the end of the day, they're still our customers."
d_counseling_blanc_07_7,Don't you have a better suggestion?
d_counseling_blanc_07_8,Coin Rush's customers can be pretty intimidating. Are you sure you can handle them?
d_counseling_blanc_07_9,"Either way, hearing you say that makes me feel reassured."
d_counseling_blanc_07_10,"Don't worry though, I'll deal with them myself."
d_counseling_blanc_07_11,"Thanks for your concern, Pit Boss."
d_counseling_blanc_07_12,Blanc and I think about ways to deal with rude customers.
d_counseling_blanc_08_1,I like Noir so much.
d_counseling_blanc_08_2,I want to do everything with her.
d_counseling_blanc_08_3,Even going on a date?
d_counseling_blanc_08_4,What a great bond you two have.
d_counseling_blanc_08_5,How did you know?
d_counseling_blanc_08_6,"As long as neither party has any misgivings, I don't see any problem with it."
d_counseling_blanc_08_7,I'm sure Noir is into the same things that I am.
d_counseling_blanc_08_8,I'm glad you think so too.
d_counseling_blanc_08_9,It's probably because I'm with her every day.
d_counseling_blanc_08_10,"So, I like the things she likes,"
d_counseling_blanc_08_11,and hate the things she doesn't.
d_counseling_blanc_08_12,I have a meaningful session with Blanc.
d_counseling_blanc_09_1,"Pit Boss, is there any other way I can address you?"
d_counseling_blanc_09_2,Pit Boss sounds so... old-fashioned at times.
d_counseling_blanc_09_3,Call me by my real name.
d_counseling_blanc_09_4,"Call me ""Darling."""
d_counseling_blanc_09_5,{AccountData.NickName}.
d_counseling_blanc_09_6,Like this?
d_counseling_blanc_09_7,"Ooh, I'm enjoying this!"
d_counseling_blanc_09_8,"{AccountData.NickName}, make sure to watch my show today!"
d_counseling_blanc_09_9,... Darling.
d_counseling_blanc_09_10,Hmm... it feels a bit weird to me.
d_counseling_blanc_09_11,How about I call you by your name instead?
d_counseling_blanc_09_12,I talk to Blanc about nicknames.
d_counseling_blanc_10_1,"I noticed Alice calls you ""Rabbity."""
d_counseling_blanc_10_2,Would you be willing to try on my bunny ears?
d_counseling_blanc_10_3,No thanks.
d_counseling_blanc_10_4,"... Sure, I guess."
d_counseling_blanc_10_5,Are you sure? I think you'd be adorable in them.
d_counseling_blanc_10_6,Can't you just try it once?
d_counseling_blanc_10_7,Really?!
d_counseling_blanc_10_8,"You'll make an adorable bunny, I'm sure of it."
d_counseling_blanc_10_9,"Now, which color would suit you best..."
d_counseling_blanc_10_10,Blanc and I wear bunny ears and hang out for a while.
d_counseling_blanc_11_1,"If I were to wear something aside from the bunny costume,"
d_counseling_blanc_11_2,what kind of outfit would be nice?
d_counseling_blanc_11_3,You're perfect the way you look now.
d_counseling_blanc_11_4,A skin-tight dress.
d_counseling_blanc_11_5,I also think my current looks suit me nicely.
d_counseling_blanc_11_6,"Since you like it too,"
d_counseling_blanc_11_7,then I'll stay this way!
d_counseling_blanc_11_8,I dunno... tight-fitting clothes aren't the most convenient.
d_counseling_blanc_11_9,"I'd like to try wearing something really fancy for once,"
d_counseling_blanc_11_10,"but if skin-tight is what interests you, I'll try wearing that next time."
d_counseling_blanc_11_11,I talk to Blanc about clothes.
d_counseling_blanc_12_1,...
d_counseling_blanc_12_2,Blanc stares at me intently.
d_counseling_blanc_12_3,Are you in love with me?
d_counseling_blanc_12_4,... Can you stop staring?
d_counseling_blanc_12_5,Huh? How did you know?
d_counseling_blanc_12_6,"You're so handsome, Pit Boss. Not that I'm just now coming to this realization; I've felt this way for a while."
d_counseling_blanc_12_7,I never get tired of looking at you.
d_counseling_blanc_12_8,Oh! Sorry.
d_counseling_blanc_12_9,I didn't realize I was staring.
d_counseling_blanc_12_10,Blanc and I talk about my appearance.
d_counseling_blanc_13_1,I've been busy as a bee lately.
d_counseling_blanc_13_2,"What would you like to do if you had a vacation, Pit Boss?"
d_counseling_blanc_13_3,Hang out with you.
d_counseling_blanc_13_4,Not budge an inch and have a nice staycation.
d_counseling_blanc_13_5,"So, you like your vacations more on the adventurous side?"
d_counseling_blanc_13_6,Me too.
d_counseling_blanc_13_7,"Next time we both have some time off, we should go somewhere together."
d_counseling_blanc_13_8,That's a good way to rest.
d_counseling_blanc_13_9,"Are you sure it wouldn't be too boring, though?"
d_counseling_blanc_13_10,I talk to Blanc about vacations.
d_counseling_blanc_14_1,I want to make some lucky charms.
d_counseling_blanc_14_2,What exactly should I make?
d_counseling_blanc_14_3,How about pictures of you?
d_counseling_blanc_14_4,How about drawings of four-leaf clovers?
d_counseling_blanc_14_5,Great idea!
d_counseling_blanc_14_6,"I'll use Noir's pictures too. That way, the luck will be doubled!"
d_counseling_blanc_14_7,I'll give you one when I'm done.
d_counseling_blanc_14_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_blanc_14_9,I'm not that great at drawing.
d_counseling_blanc_14_10,"Noir can draw pretty well, though. I'll ask her for help."
d_counseling_blanc_14_11,I talk to Blanc about lucky charms.
d_counseling_blanc_15_1,I'm going to perform at the theater this weekend.
d_counseling_blanc_15_2,"You'll come and watch, won't you?"
d_counseling_blanc_15_3,Depends on my schedule that day.
d_counseling_blanc_15_4,"I'll be there, no matter what comes up."
d_counseling_blanc_15_5,Oh... sounds like you may be busy.
d_counseling_blanc_15_6,Noir and I worked really hard on this routine though...
d_counseling_blanc_15_7,"If it's not convenient, you don't have to come."
d_counseling_blanc_15_8,"Having said that... we did work hard on preparing this performance for you,"
d_counseling_blanc_15_9,so it'd be great if you could drop by.
d_counseling_blanc_15_10,I talk to Blanc about the performance.
d_counseling_blanc_16_1,One thing on my bucket list is to perform on the surface one day.
d_counseling_blanc_16_2,"What's something on your bucket list, Pit Boss?"
d_counseling_blanc_16_3,To perform with you on stage.
d_counseling_blanc_16_4,To watch your show up on the surface.
d_counseling_blanc_16_5,"You know you can do that now, don't you?"
d_counseling_blanc_16_6,"If you want,"
d_counseling_blanc_16_7,I can arrange our choreography to include you in the next show.
d_counseling_blanc_16_8,I can't wait!
d_counseling_blanc_16_9,"The stage then will be way bigger than it is now, and there'll be way more people, too."
d_counseling_blanc_16_10,I hope that day comes sooner rather than later.
d_counseling_blanc_16_11,I talk to Blanc about bucket lists.
d_counseling_blanc_17_1,I feel so sad whenever I imagine being away from Noir.
d_counseling_blanc_17_2,"Just last night, I cried thinking about it."
d_counseling_blanc_17_3,And I hate crying...
d_counseling_blanc_17_4,Noir will always be with you.
d_counseling_blanc_17_5,You shouldn't worry about something that hasn't happened yet.
d_counseling_blanc_17_6,"Thank you for saying that, Pit Boss."
d_counseling_blanc_17_7,I don't think I could live without Noir.
d_counseling_blanc_17_8,I value her life more than my own.
d_counseling_blanc_17_9,"I know, but I can't help it sometimes."
d_counseling_blanc_17_10,"Even now, just thinking about it gets me all verklempt."
d_counseling_blanc_17_11,I try my best to calm down Blanc's overactive imagination.
d_counseling_blanc_18_1,Pit Boss.
d_counseling_blanc_18_2,A or B?
d_counseling_blanc_18_3,A.
d_counseling_blanc_18_4,B.
d_counseling_blanc_18_5,Good choice!
d_counseling_blanc_18_6,*Kiss*
d_counseling_blanc_18_7,Blanc gives me a peck on the cheek.
d_counseling_blanc_18_8,"A lucky kiss, for you."
d_counseling_blanc_18_9,Something wonderful will happen to you today.
d_counseling_blanc_18_10,"Aw shucks, I was thinking of A."
d_counseling_blanc_18_11,I guess our minds are out of sync today.
d_counseling_blanc_18_12,I'll still give you one of my drawings as a good luck charm. It's a four-leaf clover!
d_counseling_blanc_18_13,I have a particularly lucky counseling session with Blanc.
d_counseling_blanc_19_1,"Pit Boss, is there any chance we can end our session early today?"
d_counseling_blanc_19_2,I've got a date with Noir.
d_counseling_blanc_19_3,All right.
d_counseling_blanc_19_4,Can you bring me with you?
d_counseling_blanc_19_5,Thanks!
d_counseling_blanc_19_6,I haven't decided where we should go.
d_counseling_blanc_19_7,Can you help me make an itinerary?
d_counseling_blanc_19_8,Of course!
d_counseling_blanc_19_9,Noir will be thrilled.
d_counseling_blanc_19_10,"Where should we go, then?"
d_counseling_blanc_19_11,I spend some time with Blanc thinking about an itinerary.
d_counseling_blanc_20_1,"Yesterday, Noir and I had fun making nicknames for each other."
d_counseling_blanc_20_2,"If you were to give me a nickname,"
d_counseling_blanc_20_3,what would it be?
d_counseling_blanc_20_4,Good luck bunny.
d_counseling_blanc_20_5,Hmm... Can you give me some time to think?
d_counseling_blanc_20_6,That's a nice nickname.
d_counseling_blanc_20_7,But I've heard it too many times before.
d_counseling_blanc_20_8,Can you think of another one?
d_counseling_blanc_20_9,"Sure, no problem."
d_counseling_blanc_20_10,I can't tell you how excited I am for you to come up with a unique nickname for me.
d_counseling_blanc_20_11,I wonder what it'll be?
d_counseling_blanc_20_12,I spend some time with Blanc brainstorming nicknames.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_1,"Mister, even I feel like you don't take good care of yourself."
d_counseling_rosanna_01_2,Where'd you get the confidence to be like this?
d_counseling_rosanna_01_3,From you.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_4,I'm just confident in myself.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_5,Very well. I asked that question to hear this answer.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_6,That's why you have to stay by my side.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_7,"If anyone dares to mess with you, I'll make them disappear without a trace."
d_counseling_rosanna_01_8,It's good that you're confident.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_9,But I hate it when my possessions have flaws.
d_counseling_rosanna_01_10,"So, you should take better care of yourself."
d_counseling_rosanna_01_11,I spend a peaceful counseling session with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_02_1,Another traitor turned up in the organization.
d_counseling_rosanna_02_2,"They know that if they're caught, they'll pay with their lives, but they keep popping up."
d_counseling_rosanna_02_3,Sounds exhausting.
d_counseling_rosanna_02_4,Sounds like lonely work.
d_counseling_rosanna_02_5,"It is, physically speaking, at least."
d_counseling_rosanna_02_6,"In order to send a message, I usually take care of these things personally."
d_counseling_rosanna_02_7,"Once we're done here, I'll take care of this latest mole we found."
d_counseling_rosanna_02_8,Lonely?
d_counseling_rosanna_02_9,"I'm with you, Mister. Why would I be lonesome?"
d_counseling_rosanna_02_10,We usually weed out these moles before I have time to get emotionally attached to them anyway.
d_counseling_rosanna_02_11,"During our session, Rosanna and I talk about traitors."
d_counseling_rosanna_03_1,"Your room is a bit barebone, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_03_2,How about decorating it a little more?
d_counseling_rosanna_03_3,Think I should upgrade the chairs?
d_counseling_rosanna_03_4,Think I should get a fancier carpet?
d_counseling_rosanna_03_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_03_6,Don't you think it'd be somewhat weird only having one top-of-the-line chair?
d_counseling_rosanna_03_7,"If that's what you're after, though, I won't stop you."
d_counseling_rosanna_03_8,I think that'd help the vibe in here. I approve.
d_counseling_rosanna_03_9,What do you think about having it in black and white?
d_counseling_rosanna_03_10,I like neutral colors.
d_counseling_rosanna_03_11,I have a discussion about interior design with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_1,"If someone hit you without provocation,"
d_counseling_rosanna_04_2,what would you do?
d_counseling_rosanna_04_3,I'd call the A.C.P.U.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_4,I'd hit them right back.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_5,Right... I suppose you live in a world governed by rules.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_6,"But if there ever comes a time when someone's in your face, feel free to give them a smack."
d_counseling_rosanna_04_7,I'll take care of the rest.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_8,"A perfect answer. For me, that is."
d_counseling_rosanna_04_9,"I'm not so sure about you, though."
d_counseling_rosanna_04_10,The world you live in is different from mine. Yours is governed by rules.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_11,Don't feel as if you have to impress me.
d_counseling_rosanna_04_12,I have a short counseling session with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_1,"I'm sorry, but I think I'll have to cut today's session short."
d_counseling_rosanna_05_2,... Duck!
d_counseling_rosanna_05_3,Duck at once.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_4,Try to figure out what's going on first.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_5,*Bang bang*
d_counseling_rosanna_05_6,I didn't think they'd follow me all the way out here.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_7,Sorry for startling you. Let me take care of this real quick.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_8,You idiot!
d_counseling_rosanna_05_9,Rosanna forcefully pushes my head down.
d_counseling_rosanna_05_10,*Bang bang*
d_counseling_rosanna_05_11,"When you're with me, act first, ask questions later."
d_counseling_rosanna_05_12,"If not, you're only making it harder to protect you."
d_counseling_rosanna_05_13,I have a dangerous counseling session with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_1,I feel like having a bit of the strong stuff.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_2,Got any booze around here?
d_counseling_rosanna_06_3,All I've got is soda.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_4,How about we go out for a drink after our session?
d_counseling_rosanna_06_5,Soda...
d_counseling_rosanna_06_6,Not really my thing.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_7,I'd prefer something with a little more kick.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_8,"Hey now, where'd this impulsiveness come from?"
d_counseling_rosanna_06_9,I'm down.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_10,I'll get a table at the place I usually go to.
d_counseling_rosanna_06_11,I have a conversation about alcohol with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_1,Ugh... I'm bored.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_2,Is there anything fun to do around here?
d_counseling_rosanna_07_3,You could look for someone worth killing.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_4,We could play a board game.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_5,You think I roam the streets looking for people to kill whenever I'm bored?
d_counseling_rosanna_07_6,"I'm not perfect, but I'm not a psychopath."
d_counseling_rosanna_07_7,... I suppose doing that would help alleviate my boredom though...
d_counseling_rosanna_07_8,You've got board games? That sounds fun.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_9,What kind of games do you have?
d_counseling_rosanna_07_10,Be forewarned: I'm super competitive.
d_counseling_rosanna_07_11,I kill some time with Rosanna during an uneventful counseling session.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_1,The guy I was supposed to make a deal with didn't show up yesterday.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_2,I've been dealing with him for quite some time.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_3,"If you were in this situation, Mister, what would you be thinking?"
d_counseling_rosanna_08_4,That there must have been some reason that he wasn't able to make it.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_5,That he'd betrayed me.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_6,"Oh, you sweet summer child."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_7,"In our world, your word is your bond."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_8,"Unless he's dead in a ditch somewhere, there's no excuse for him not showing up."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_9,"To do otherwise is considered a betrayal, plain and simple."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_10,Correct.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_11,"If there was a genuine reason that he couldn't show up, he would have found a way to notify me."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_12,"He's been covering his tracks, so I think he's up to something."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_13,We plan on finding him within two days.
d_counseling_rosanna_08_14,"Betrayal is not something we take lightly, nor should you, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_08_15,I have a conversation about a heavy topic with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_09_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_09_2,So handsome.
d_counseling_rosanna_09_3,I'd appreciate it if you stopped staring.
d_counseling_rosanna_09_4,I already know that I'm handsome.
d_counseling_rosanna_09_5,Are you doing that on purpose?
d_counseling_rosanna_09_6,You know telling me something will only make me want to do the opposite.
d_counseling_rosanna_09_7,"Soooo, I'll take that to mean you want me to stare even more."
d_counseling_rosanna_09_8,...
d_counseling_rosanna_09_9,"Talking like that is kind of a buzzkill, even for you."
d_counseling_rosanna_09_10,"Don't take it personally, that's just how I feel."
d_counseling_rosanna_09_11,I have a conversation about appearance with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_1,Moran has really been pushing it lately.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_2,I feel like my patience is quickly running thin.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_3,Any ideas on how I can handle her?
d_counseling_rosanna_10_4,I'll talk to her.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_5,Why don't you try talking to her nicely?
d_counseling_rosanna_10_6,"If you could, that'd be great."
d_counseling_rosanna_10_7,"If I tried talking to her,"
d_counseling_rosanna_10_8,a war might break out.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_9,Talk nicely?
d_counseling_rosanna_10_10,To HER?
d_counseling_rosanna_10_11,Please tell me you're joking.
d_counseling_rosanna_10_12,I have a conversation about Moran with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_1,...
d_counseling_rosanna_11_2,Rosanna doesn't seem to be in a good mood.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_3,"At times like this, it's best to..."
d_counseling_rosanna_11_4,Stay quiet.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_5,Try talking.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_6,...
d_counseling_rosanna_11_7,What are you doing?
d_counseling_rosanna_11_8,"You can clearly see that I'm in a foul mood, and you're just going to stand there gawking at me?"
d_counseling_rosanna_11_9,"I have to say,"
d_counseling_rosanna_11_10,hearing your voice does make me feel a bit better.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_11,Keep talking.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_12,It doesn't matter what about.
d_counseling_rosanna_11_13,I continue counseling Rosanna while trying to make her feel better.
d_counseling_rosanna_12_1,*Bang*
d_counseling_rosanna_12_2,...!
d_counseling_rosanna_12_3,Argh!
d_counseling_rosanna_12_4,*Bang bang*
d_counseling_rosanna_12_5,"No good. If this was for real, you'd be pushing up daisies."
d_counseling_rosanna_12_6,"Good acting, though."
d_counseling_rosanna_12_7,Very nice!
d_counseling_rosanna_12_8,Paying back one shot with two.
d_counseling_rosanna_12_9,"If this was real, I would have lost."
d_counseling_rosanna_12_10,Rosanna and I continue acting out various scenarios during our session.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_1,I'm curious about what people think about Hedonia.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_2,What do you think?
d_counseling_rosanna_13_3,They probably fear you.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_4,They probably consider you a sort of rag-tag family.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_5,That's fine with me.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_6,With fear comes power.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_7,"The greater the fear, the fewer people there will be giving me guff."
d_counseling_rosanna_13_8,"So you'd do well to stick close to me, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_13_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_13_10,Don't you think that's taking us just a tad too lightly?
d_counseling_rosanna_13_11,You make it sound like people don't fear us at all.
d_counseling_rosanna_13_12,I have a conversation about Hedonia with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_1,I'm curious about something.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_2,What scares you more: a knife or a gun?
d_counseling_rosanna_14_3,Knife.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_4,Gun.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_5,I figured as much.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_6,People seem to fear knives more because they're so accessible.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_7,It's easier to imagine what it'd be like to get cut with one.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_8,"In that case, I'll subject my next target to the tip of a knife."
d_counseling_rosanna_14_9,"Hmm. You've been around your fair share of guns, so I suppose it makes sense that you'd feel that way."
d_counseling_rosanna_14_10,Most people have a greater fear of knives.
d_counseling_rosanna_14_11,"The vast majority of people haven't been shot before, so it's probably harder for them to imagine the pain of a gunshot."
d_counseling_rosanna_14_12,"So, I actually think I should torture my next target with a knife instead."
d_counseling_rosanna_14_13,I have a somewhat unnerving conversation with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_15_1,I heard you went to see cherry blossoms with Sakura a while back.
d_counseling_rosanna_15_2,Where do you plan on taking me?
d_counseling_rosanna_15_3,The shopping mall.
d_counseling_rosanna_15_4,The hotel.
d_counseling_rosanna_15_5,Shopping mall?
d_counseling_rosanna_15_6,Is there something you've been wanting to buy?
d_counseling_rosanna_15_7,"I could buy it for you, no problem, but I have to say, I'm a little disappointed."
d_counseling_rosanna_15_8,I was thinking you'd take me somewhere special.
d_counseling_rosanna_15_9,!!
d_counseling_rosanna_15_10,"I'll take that as a signal, and an obvious one at that."
d_counseling_rosanna_15_11,I'll take you up on that offer!
d_counseling_rosanna_15_12,What time works best for you?
d_counseling_rosanna_15_13,I make date plans with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_1,Mister.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_2,"If you had to choose between the head or heart, which would it be?"
d_counseling_rosanna_16_3,Head.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_4,Heart.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_5,A wise decision.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_6,"Regardless of whether it's a Nikke or a human, aim for the head."
d_counseling_rosanna_16_7,That's the only way you'll stay alive.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_8,"The heart isn't a bad idea, 
but that'll pose problems if you're going up against a Nikke."
d_counseling_rosanna_16_9,So make a habit of aiming for the head.
d_counseling_rosanna_16_10,...
d_counseling_rosanna_16_11,"My eyes are up here, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_16_12,Rosanna and I have an agreeable counseling session.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_1,Rosanna is aiming a gun at me.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_2,"This is the end, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_17_3,Any last words?
d_counseling_rosanna_17_4,I-I'm sorry I never got to see the surface!
d_counseling_rosanna_17_5,S-save me!
d_counseling_rosanna_17_6,"Aw, how cute."
d_counseling_rosanna_17_7,*Pop*
d_counseling_rosanna_17_8,A flower comes out of Rosanna's gun.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_9,A present from the surface.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_10,Scaredy-cat.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_11,*Pop*
d_counseling_rosanna_17_12,A flower comes out of Rosanna's gun.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_13,Why were you so scared? I've always treated you well.
d_counseling_rosanna_17_14,I have a counseling session with Rosanna that nearly gives me a heart attack.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_1,*Tap tap*
d_counseling_rosanna_18_2,Rosanna taps her lips twice with her fingers.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_3,Lean in closer to Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_4,Tap your own lips twice.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_5,Hmm?
d_counseling_rosanna_18_6,That's not what I was hinting at.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_7,You need to learn to read signals better.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_8,Having said that... you can continue what you were doing.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_9,You're pretty good at reading signals.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_10,This is a secret signal I use often.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_11,It means that the person in front of me can be trusted.
d_counseling_rosanna_18_12,"So, it's clear that we can trust each other more than ever."
d_counseling_rosanna_18_13,I have a meaningful counseling session with Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_1,*Phew* I'm pooped.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_2,Can I rest a little?
d_counseling_rosanna_19_3,Of course.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_4,Did something happen?
d_counseling_rosanna_19_5,"Man, this couch is comfy."
d_counseling_rosanna_19_6,It's not easy for me to let my guard down around others.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_7,"Thanks, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_19_8,Nothing out of the ordinary.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_9,You shouldn't ask too many questions.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_10,You might get hurt if you know too much.
d_counseling_rosanna_19_11,I spend a while watching Rosanna rest.
d_counseling_rosanna_20_1,I'm thinking of buying some new clothes.
d_counseling_rosanna_20_2,What do you think would look good on me?
d_counseling_rosanna_20_3,Bright colors that pop.
d_counseling_rosanna_20_4,"Subtle, neutral colors."
d_counseling_rosanna_20_5,Is that what you like?
d_counseling_rosanna_20_6,"Well, it doesn't suit me."
d_counseling_rosanna_20_7,"If I wore garish clothing, I'd attract a lot of unwanted attention, which would make my life more difficult than it already is."
d_counseling_rosanna_20_8,Good call.
d_counseling_rosanna_20_9,"It's better for me to fly under the radar, so I usually go for inconspicuous colors."
d_counseling_rosanna_20_10,"They tend to look better on me, anyway."
d_counseling_rosanna_20_11,How about we go shopping?
d_counseling_rosanna_20_12,Rosanna and I spend some time thinking about what clothes she could buy.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_1,Waterpower.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_2,"Waterpower, waterpower!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_3,"Waterpower, waterpower!
Waterpower!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_4,Waterpower!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_5,Firepower!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_6,"Waterpower, waterpower!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_7,Waterpower! Waterpower!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_8,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_9,Wanterpower...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_01_10,Neon and I 'waterpower' together for a while.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_1,Master.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_2,I think I can finally be reborn as a hybrid.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_3,"From now on, you're gonna be on easy street."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_4,Can a hybrid solve the Ark's energy crisis?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_5,"So, in other words, you're an opportunist."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_6,Uh...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_7,Um...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_8,I think I've got to train more for that.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_9,Huh?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_10,If you mean I'm someone who grabs an opportunity the moment I see it...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_11,... Then that's exactly what I am!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_02_12,Neon and I pontificate on the profundity of hybrids.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_1,Huff... Huff... Master!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_2,I almost fell for Yan's promotional tactics again!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_3,I'm impressed that you stood your ground.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_4,What did you buy this time?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_5,I know!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_6,I dropped by Yan's shop earlier to buy some watermelon juice.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_7,But she told me there was a 10-drink minimum for each order.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_8,"When I refused, she changed her tune and said I only had to buy three,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_9,and that she'd then give me a conch necklace for free.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_10,And what did you do?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_11,"She said I'd get a free necklace if I bought three cups of juice, so I did."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_12,"In other words, you fell for it."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_13,Nuh-uh!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_14,I didn't pay for the conch necklace.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_15,*Honk*
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_16,"When Neon blows the conch, a resounding echo booms."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_17,"... Well, as long as you're happy."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_03_18,I watch Neon blow the conch to her heart's content.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_1,I've been wondering...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_2,Why is sea water so salty? It tastes awful.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_3,Why are you so hell-bent on drinking it?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_4,Because there are seamounts erupting deep in the ocean depths.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_5,Oh. I don't drink it because I want to.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_6,It's just that I always end up accidentally swallowing some when I'm swimming in the ocean.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_7,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_8,"The salt in the rocks melts into the sea, and..."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_9,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_10,... Fine.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_04_11,I talk about some scientific topics with Neon.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_1,I took a catnap on the hammock for a while earlier because I was pooped.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_2,"Frima got really upset with me though,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_3,and demanded to know why I was sleeping on her bed.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_4,Aren't hammocks meant to be used by everyone?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_5,I'll talk to her about it.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_6,"But Frima set that up herself, didn't she? And you were off to the side napping."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_7,"Ah, well..."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_8,"Actually, I didn't help much when the hammock was being set up."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_9,Then why are you mad?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_10,"I figured since I didn't have the facts on my side, I had to try and appeal to your sympathy."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_11,"Yeah, so?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_12,That doesn't mean she can't share it!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_13,People like you are the reason we can't have nice things.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_14,Hmph!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_05_15,"Neon is agitated about her nap being interrupted, and I let her sleep on my lap."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_1,There's something I've noticed during our vacation here.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_2,I'm very talented at goofing off.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_3,Anyone can do that.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_4,"All right, show me what you've got."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_5,Nuh-uh!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_6,Goofing around requires a huge amount of energy and creativity.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_7,This is a unique skill set that not just anyone can master!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_8,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_9,Hyah!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_10,Pfffwaaah! Hyah!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_06_11,I pick up a few pointers on how to goof around from Neon.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_1,Master.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_2,What do you think of my swimsuit? Be honest.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_3,It's cute.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_4,"Very aquatic, and perfectly symmetrical."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_5,!!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_6,Um... Thank you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_7,I'm glad you like it.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_8,Huh?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_9,How can you tell it's got perfect symmetry if you've only
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_10,seen me from one side?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_11,"That's a very thoughtful answer though, and I appreciate that."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_07_12,I continue to praise Neon's swimsuit for a while.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_1,Master!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_2,"When you think of fun activities to do by the seaside, what comes to mind first?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_3,Great big fireworks that light up the sky.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_4,Adrenaline-pumping water sports where you zoom across the sea.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_5,"Master, I've already told you."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_6,I've temporarily cast aside my desire for all things pyrotechnic.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_7,"Not even the word ""fireworks"" will make me waver."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_8,Not... one... bit...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_9,I see.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_10,"So you like water sports, do you?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_11,*Splash*
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_12,... Drip.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_13,... Drop.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_14,What in the world are you doing?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_15,"You said you like water sports, so I thought I'd splash you with some water."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_16,You don't seem too pleased though... I think I should go.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_08_17,Neon beats a swift retreat.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_2,I've been pondering something lately.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_3,"If a shark and whale fought, who would win?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_4,"The shark, of course."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_5,"The whale, of course."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_6,Right.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_7,"Sharks are agile, and they have sharp teeth."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_8,But what if it were against a killer whale?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_9,Right.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_10,"The sheer enormity of a whale is a big advantage, and they're smart."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_11,... But what if it were against a great white shark?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_12,It still couldn't beat a killer whale.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_13,I should have known you'd put the question of
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_14,"this royal rumble to rest, Master."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_09_15,Neon and I continue to imagine other battles between marine powerhouses.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_1,You know that beach chair in the coastal clinic?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_2,You think it'd feel cozy if you were to lie there for a long time?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_3,"That spot is shaded from the sun, and there's a nice breeze."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_4,Are you planning on malingering?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_5,"If you stay there for too long, they'll give you a shot."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_6,What?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_7,What an accusation!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_8,"I may be pretending to be a patient when I'm not,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_9,"but I'm not faking an illness, necessarily."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_10,Ah...!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_11,I didn't even think about that.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_12,"In that case, I'll keep my eyes peeled and slink off when it's my turn."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_10_13,I tell Neon of other nice places where she can avoid the heat.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_1,Could you give me some recommendations
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_2,for some summer activities I can do with Mary?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_3,Catch a cold and get a shot for it.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_4,Play games that test your courage in the dead of the night.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_5,"But Master, it's summer! Not even Volt could catch a cold this time of year."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_6,"Besides, you know how much I hate needles."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_7,Hmm... there are a lot of ancient structures on this island. You don't think it'd be too scary playing at night?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_8,"Then again, it might be fun if Mary's there with me."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_9,Even a ghost would run away at the sight of Mary holding a syringe.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_11_10,Neon and I plan how we'll be spending summer vacation with Mary.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_1,"Volt and I have gotten closer recently, and it made me think..."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_2,I'd like to raise a dog of my own.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_3,Are you sure that you can handle that responsibility?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_4,Dogs are always the cutest when you don't have to take care of them.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_5,Of course!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_6,Even when you have to go into isolation to hone your waterpower?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_7,Oh. I didn't think of that.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_8,"Thanks for pointing that out, Master!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_9,Huh?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_10,I still want to raise one myself.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_11,"Whenever Volt sees Liter while I'm playing with him, he ditches me straight away and runs to her."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_12_12,Neon and I show each other photos we took of Volt while conversing.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_1,I collected way too many shells from the beach.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_2,I'm having a tough time figuring out which ones I like.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_3,How about diving into the sea to look for some?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_4,"Oh, there's one by your feet..."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_5,What?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_6,Then I would be a shell without a soul.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_7,What?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_8,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_9,Whoa! This one's shaped like a train! I've never seen anything like that before!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_13_10,Neon gives me a crash course on seashell collection.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_2,I think my waterpower and firepower can work in harmony now.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_3,That means I'll be the big cheese amongst the hybrids.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_4,I suppose so.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_5,Everyone knows Brid is the big cheese amongst the hybrids.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_6,Woohoo! Master finally acknowledged me!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_7,I'm gonna go around and tell everyone about this!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_8,"Oh, right! Hybrid does sound like ""High Brid""."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_9,"When you consider that, Brid's the natural choice to be the head honcho."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_10,I guess I'm doomed to only ascend so high...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_14_11,I study the fundamentals of the world of hybrids with Neon.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_1,I recently discovered a real conundrum.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_2,"If I go into the sea wearing glasses and I get slammed by a rogue wave,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_3,my glasses will go flying and be swept away. What should I do?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_4,Throw your glasses into the water before the wave gets you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_5,How about wearing goggles instead of glasses?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_6,Nice!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_7,Neon takes off her glasses and tosses them into the ocean.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_8,*Plop*
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_9,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_10,Agh! I can't see!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_11,How am I going to live now?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_12,... Let's go. I'll help you find your glasses.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_13,!!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_14,Goggles would definitely be more secure than glasses.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_15,I'll try to ask Liter to make me a pair.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_15_16,I study ways to avoid losing things with Neon.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_1,"Master, there's this Nikke."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_2,She comes across a faucet while walking on the street.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_3,What does she do?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_4,Turn it on.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_5,Walk by it.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_6,That's right.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_7,"If you see a faucet, you crank that baby to the max! It's the most logical course of action."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_8,"Faucet, activate! Splash!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_9,... Master.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_10,Are you trying to upset me?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_11,I thought the answer would be painfully obvious to you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_16_12,"Together, Neon and I make up a fable about the water nation."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_1,"Whenever I'm hanging out at the beach,  I sometimes look up at the clinic,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_2,and I can't help but notice that the doctors are always staring at you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_3,What could that mean?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_4,They're spies from Tetra. We should keep our eyes peeled.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_5,... No comment.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_6,!!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_7,You're right. Elysion can't be the only one of the Big Three to plant spies in our midst.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_8,I'll be extra vigilant from now on.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_9,Huh?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_10,"You know something, don't you?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_11,What is it? What are you keeping from me?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_12,I'm not keeping anything from you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_13,"You say that, but that smile of yours is awfully ambiguous..."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_17_14,We talk about secret stories related to the doctors in Seraphim.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_2,have you got any in-depth knowledge to impart to me today?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_3,No. It's time that you strike out on your own.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_4,"Sure, let's take a dip in the ocean."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_5,What? But I only just started learning waterpower from you.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_6,Are you sure I'm ready to be on my own?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_7,It sounds to me more like you're trying to shirk responsibility.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_8,"... Hehe, all right."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_9,I'm hoping to extend my water gun's range today.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_10,"If I can pull that off, I'll consider today's training a success."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_18_11,I spend some time with Neon as her mentor.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_1,The path of waterpower is such a profound discipline.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_2,"I wonder, what is its essence?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_3,... Water.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_4,"I am waterpower, therefore waterpower is."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_5,I think you may be taking this too literally.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_6,"Or am I? Fear not, young grasshopper, you are still new to this world."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_7,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_8,Whoa!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_9,"That's like... super-duper profound! And confusing as heck, too!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_10,"The next time someone asks me, that's what I'm gonna tell them."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_19_11,I talk to Neon about the essence of waterpower.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_1,Yan and I had some wonderfully refreshing fruit today.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_2,Want to taste some?
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_3,We got two kinds. Pick whichever one you want!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_4,I'll take the one that's a bit hairy.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_5,I want the pink mushroom.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_6,"Hmm, this one's looking a bit weird, don't you think?"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_7,Neon and I peel the fruit and taste it.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_8,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_9,Whoa... whoa! This is delicious!
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_10,"Let's have some more! No, a lot more!"
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_11,I've got some reservations about this one.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_12,"But, the Ark is low on resources, so we should do our part and give it a taste."
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_13,We roast the mushrooms and take a few tentative nibbles.
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_14,...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_15,Barf...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_16,Blurgh...
d_counseling_neon_blueocean_20_17,We end up having to visit the clinic for our upset stomachs.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_1,"Are you all right, Commander?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_2,I saw you having a really intense water fight with Neon by the beach earlier.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_3,"You didn't hurt yourself, did you?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_4,I'm just fine.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_5,"Actually, I did take a tumble and swallowed a mouthful of salt water."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_6,Are you sure?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_7,You should know better than to lie to a doctor.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_8,I clearly saw you fall into the water.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_9,"Considering how long you were under, you must be 90% filled with salt water by now."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_10,How about letting me take a look?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_11,I knew it. I told you not to play in the water for too long.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_12,Drinking too much seawater can make you dehydrated.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_13,"Come along, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_14,It's time to give you some treatment.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_01_15,I obediently let Mary lead me to the clinic by hand.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_2,"this might seem a bit random,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_3,but what do you think of my swimsuit?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_4,It's sexy.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_5,"You're right, that is a bit out of left field."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_6,...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_7,"You're nothing if not to the point, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_8,"But I like this side of you, too."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_9,Are you blushing?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_10,"You're not too hot, are you? Is it because there's no A/C?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_02_11,Mary and I have a nice conversation.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_1,It sure is sweltering out here.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_2,What can I do
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_3,to beat the summer heat?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_4,Nothing beats a nice iced coffee.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_5,You can't go wrong with a cool slice of refreshing watermelon.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_6,"Now that you mention coffee, Commander,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_7,you've been drinking that stuff like there's no tomorrow lately.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_8,Too much caffeine is bad for the body.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_9,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_10,"If the weather's really blistering, having some watermelon can be good for you."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_11,But you should really cut down on all the iced coffee you've been drinking.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_03_12,I talk to Mary about ways to beat the summer heat.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_1,"I've prepared a quiz for you, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_2,The ocean is right before you.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_3,The vast azure waters are glimmering invitingly.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_4,What do you do?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_5,Do a few warm-up stretches and enter the water.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_6,Dive in without any hesitation.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_7,Very good! That's the correct answer.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_8,"Far too easy a question for someone as smart as you, isn't it?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_9,"Next time, I'll have to prepare a harder quiz for you."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_10,"If you do that,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_11,you might end up passing out and waking up to an unfamiliar ceiling above you.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_12,You'd ostensibly be diving straight into a bed at the clinic.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_13,Is that what you want?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_04_14,I review water safety procedures with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_1,"I don't know if it's because it's cooler in the clinic,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_2,but we've had an influx of patients lately. It's rather disconcerting.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_3,What should I do to drive away those who aren't actually sick?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_4,Rely on your trusty old needles.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_5,Why not take the chance to give them a checkup?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_6,"We need to be careful with giving injections, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_7,"Of course, for those who are faking an illness, we can use IV drips and the like."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_8,"But I believe there are other, more effective ways."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_9,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_10,"People usually don't like coming in for checkups, even when we offer them for free."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_11,I could take this chance to scratch them off the list
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_12,"Thanks for the suggestion, Commander!"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_05_13,I talk with Mary about how to deal with malingerers.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_2,"it seems you've got a little sunburn,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_3,Have you been using the sunscreen I gave you?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_4,Every day.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_5,"I can't reach my back, so I haven't been putting it on."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_6,Okay...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_7,"I suppose there's not much we can do to avoid getting a little burnt, since the sun is so strong."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_8,"If you need more, just let me know."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_9,I'm not only talking about your back!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_10,Come over here.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_11,Is this the spot you were referring to?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_12,Ouch!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_13,Or here?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_14,Ow...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_06_15,I learn from Mary how effective sunscreen is against UV rays.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_1,More and more people have been getting stung by jellyfish lately.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_2,"Typically, it's not a big deal, but you never know."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_3,"I've been telling everyone to be careful, but no one listens to me."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_4,And it's not like I can capture the jellyfish... This is really quite worrisome.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_5,Do you have any suggestions?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_6,How about putting up a warning sign that people won't miss?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_7,Put your trust in me. I'll kill all the jellyfish.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_8,"A great idea as always, Commander. Good thing I asked you."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_9,"That shouldn't be too hard to pull off, and it will likely reduce the number of stings significantly."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_10,I'll discuss with Pepper how to make that sign.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_11,That may be a bit extreme...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_12,We don't want to kill off an entire species just because they pose an inconvenience.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_13,"Besides, I don't think that would really reduce the number of people getting stung."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_14,"Moreover, we might find you washed up on the shore 
covered in jellyfish stings."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_07_15,Mary and I learn about jellyfish.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_1,"Time flies by so quickly.
The sun is already setting."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_2,"What do you think of when you see the sunset, Commander?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_3,I feel as if I'm looking at a painting. It's beautiful.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_4,I feel a bit melancholy.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_5,I agree.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_6,It really is like looking at a painting. One with no imperfections.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_7,"It's so magical, it's hard to believe that it's real life."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_8,"You're so sentimental, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_9,"I keep having the feeling that I've seen this view before,
back when I was living an ordinary life."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_10,"But those times are long gone, much like the setting sun soon will be gone."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_11,"Hehe, I guess now that I think about it, I'm a bit melancholy myself. Of course, it bears mentioning that this entire view is artificial."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_08_12,I watch the sunset with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_1,I've always felt that Pepper is absolutely adorable.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_2,Don't you agree?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_3,Super cute. She follows you around like a puppy.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_4,"Eh, I dunno."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_5,"Ha, that she does."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_6,I think she has become more clingy during this mission.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_7,I wonder if Liter feels the same way about Volt?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_8,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_9,I'm shocked that you don't find Pepper as cute as I do.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_09_10,I have an earnest conversation with Mary about Pepper.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_1,What illness should you be extra careful of during summer?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_2,"I'll give you a few hints: fever, headache, and chills."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_3,A cold.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_4,The flu.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_5,"Another softball question, I see."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_6,"The greater the temperature difference between day and night, the more wary you should be of potentially catching a cold."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_7,"Even though it's hot during the day, you should bring a jacket with you for when the sun goes down."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_8,... Huh?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_9,"Flu season generally tends to be around autumn, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_10,"I see you did your research before coming here, though. How adorable, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_10_11,I receive a free lesson from Mary on different illnesses.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_1,"I came across a shell with medicinal effects,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_2,so I asked Neon to dig up a whole bunch of them for me. She got around 100!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_3,Are you really going to need all of those?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_4,Neon could do this kind of stuff in her sleep.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_5,"Hard to say,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_6,but Neon certainly seemed happy.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_7,"She hollered, ""Neon: Impact!"" and then took off running."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_8,"It seems she really enjoys looking for shells, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_9,"In fact, she ran off without putting on her swim ring..."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_10,"Actually, I should have Pepper go find her and give that to her."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_11_11,"Mary and I spend some time together, guessing how long Neon will be digging for shells."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_1,"Commander, what kind of color do you think I like?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_2,White.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_3,Red.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_4,Hehe. I knew you'd say that.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_5,"Although I'm wearing a white swimsuit now,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_6,I actually don't really like white.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_7,"Oh, that's unexpected!"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_8,I thought you'd say another color.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_9,You're right: red is in fact my favorite color.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_10,It symbolizes warmth and passion. Kind of like the way you treat Nikkes. Hehe.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_12_11,Mary and I talk about our favorite colors.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_1,Which do you think I pull off better?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_2,"Swimsuits, or my usual attire?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_3,"Swimsuits, because of the novelty factor. We don't get to see you wearing something like this often."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_4,Your usual attire.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_5,"Hehe,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_6,"you didn't have to justify your answer, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_7,"I guess I should show it off more often, so that it won't be such an uncommon sight."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_8,"In that case, I should go and change."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_9,"Just joking, hehe!"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_10,Don't look so upset.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_13_11,Mary and I share our opinions on her fashion style.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_1,"Commander, you know how important getting enough sleep is."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_2,But I heard that you've been staying up until late at night recently.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_3,Why is that?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_4,... It's hard for me to talk about.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_5,I have too much work piled up.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_6,Huh...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_7,...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_8,"Fair enough. You are an adult, after all."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_9,I feel like I've created some kind of misunderstanding...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_10,Good thing I asked.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_11,Make sure to drop by the clinic tomorrow.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_12,"I'll give you a special prescription that'll get rid of all that fatigue in no time, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_14_13,Guess I'll have to visit the clinic tomorrow.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_1,"Even if you're at the beach,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_2,"in vacation mode,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_3,"there are some things you shouldn't slack off on, don't you think?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_4,I've been having so much fun that I haven't had time to rest properly.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_5,"... Sorry, I didn't hear you. What was that?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_6,"If you want to be healthy, resting is essential."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_7,Make sure to take it easy today.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_8,Goodness gracious!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_9,"Your stamina has hit rock bottom, no doubt due to the hot weather."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_10,You'd better have another checkup.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_15_11,I once again learn the importance of resting.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_1,"People always say they don't like it when it's windy at the beach, because of the sand."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_2,I don't think it's that bad though. I wonder why?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_3,"Maybe because your eyes are smaller, not as much sand gets in them?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_4,Maybe your wide-brim hat shields you from the sand?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_5,You think so?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_6,...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_7,"So if I open my eyes wide like this, I might find the wind uncomfortable too."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_8,"Hehe, I didn't startle you, did I, Commander?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_9,That could very well be the case.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_10,I'm going to recommend hats like this to other people.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_16_11,I spend some time with Mary picking out hats.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_1,Doesn't Pepper look lovely
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_2,in her swimsuit?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_3,I love it! Such a fresh and different look for her!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_4,I prefer a bit more of a mature vibe.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_5,Such an enthusiastic response.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_6,I'll have to let Pepper know how you feel.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_7,I can't wait for her reaction.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_8,I assume that's directed toward me?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_9,"Thank you for the compliment, Commander."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_17_10,I share my swimsuit preferences with Mary.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_1,Pepper seems to be too much of a workaholic.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_2,She's been spreading herself far too thin.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_3,What can I do to make her rest?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_4,"That's rich, coming from you."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_5,I could fake an illness and lure her out of the clinic.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_6,...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_7,Hehe. I didn't expect to be called out like that.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_8,"All right then, how about we go for a walk tomorrow?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_9,"Are you telling me, a doctor, to lie?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_10,"As much as I'd like to turn down your suggestion,"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_11,I think that may well be the only way we can get Pepper to leave.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_18_12,Mary and I make a plan to let Pepper rest.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_1,"Commander, do you enjoy"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_2,cold showers or hot showers more?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_3,Cold showers.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_4,Hot showers.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_5,That settles it then!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_6,Hyah!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_7,*Splash*
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_8,What the... what's this?
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_9,"Since you're at the beach, you should try playing in the water at least once."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_10,"It's good for your health too. This is called killing two birds with one stone, hehe."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_11,"Well, the seawater is a bit cold, but what can you do?"
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_12,*Splash*
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_13,Eek! That's freezing!
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_14,Mary runs away after splashing water all over me.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_19_15,I have so much fun playing in the water with Mary that I forget about the time.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_1,"I just don't understand how someone can be injured so severely, without even knowing it."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_2,I'll be more careful next time.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_3,I didn't want to lose to Neon in the water gun fight...
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_4,"Pain is a signal sent to the body, telling it to flee from the current situation."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_5,You say you'll be more careful in the future. I hope that's true.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_6,Seems like you had quite an intense battle.
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_7,"Still, you should take better care of yourself."
d_counseling_mary_baygoddess_20_8,I receive both gentle treatment and a harsh scolding from Mary.
d_counseling_mast_01_1,"Since ancient times, cats have been a symbol of good luck for sailors."
d_counseling_mast_01_2,I heard that having a feline companion on board can even ward off shipwrecks.
d_counseling_mast_01_3,"What do you think, should we get a cat for the Admire?"
d_counseling_mast_01_4,Will the cat be able to get along with Morgan?
d_counseling_mast_01_5,Maybe we can ask Nero to help us out.
d_counseling_mast_01_6,"Oh shoot, I hadn't thought of that."
d_counseling_mast_01_7,...
d_counseling_mast_01_8,"Well, Morgan is pretty understanding, so I'm sure it'll work out somehow."
d_counseling_mast_01_9,"Hey, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_mast_01_10,"Ahaha! You're such a genius, Captain!"
d_counseling_mast_01_11,I'll go look for a cat tree to put on the ship!
d_counseling_mast_01_12,"We look into the process of adopting a cat,"
d_counseling_mast_01_13,but the complicated procedures and expensive fees make it too difficult for us to follow through.
d_counseling_mast_02_1,What's the deal with all this dust?
d_counseling_mast_02_2,"I keep sweeping and wiping, but it just keeps coming back."
d_counseling_mast_02_3,"With that kind of resilience, it could probably beat a sea monster easily."
d_counseling_mast_02_4,You're pretty impressive for being able to handle it.
d_counseling_mast_02_5,How about getting a robot vacuum?
d_counseling_mast_02_6,Really?
d_counseling_mast_02_7,You're right. I do manage to get rid of it every time it pops up.
d_counseling_mast_02_8,Maybe that means I'm at the top of the food chain!
d_counseling_mast_02_9,That's actually a great idea.
d_counseling_mast_02_10,"Although, I don't think the Admire is the right size for it..."
d_counseling_mast_02_11,...
d_counseling_mast_02_12,"Anyway, I'll bring it up to Helm."
d_counseling_mast_02_13,We discuss mindset management in cleaning.
d_counseling_mast_03_1,"Ahoy, Captain!"
d_counseling_mast_03_2,Have you ever heard of the drifting ghost ship?
d_counseling_mast_03_3,I don't like horror stories.
d_counseling_mast_03_4,Tell me about it.
d_counseling_mast_03_5,"Ha, I thought you were braver than that."
d_counseling_mast_03_6,How about giving it a chance?
d_counseling_mast_03_7,"Trust me, it's not so scary once you hear the story."
d_counseling_mast_03_8,"Well, as you know, no survivors have been reported upon the surface."
d_counseling_mast_03_9,But some resource miners went to the coast and told me something interesting.
d_counseling_mast_03_10,"Beyond the foggy area,"
d_counseling_mast_03_11,"there's a huge warship that keeps flashing its searchlight, blink, blink..."
d_counseling_mast_03_12,Sending out an unknown signal before vanishing like a ghost ship!
d_counseling_mast_03_13,Do you know what the signal says?
d_counseling_mast_03_14,"""Aliens have appeared. We advise all citizens to take shelter."""
d_counseling_mast_03_15,When was the last time someone mentioned Raptures aliens anyway?
d_counseling_mast_03_16,It's been ages!
d_counseling_mast_03_17,"With the lights off in the Commander's Room, I listen to Mast's story of the ghost ship."
d_counseling_mast_04_1,"Oh gosh, I'm so scared right now."
d_counseling_mast_04_2,I can't help but wonder where is Morgan's limit.
d_counseling_mast_04_3,"It's hard to gauge, you know?"
d_counseling_mast_04_4,"Morgan and me, which one do you like?"
d_counseling_mast_04_5,Did Morgan learn new phrases?
d_counseling_mast_04_6,...
d_counseling_mast_04_7,"Captain, seriously?"
d_counseling_mast_04_8,Are you really competing with a bird right now?
d_counseling_mast_04_9,"Haha, you bet!"
d_counseling_mast_04_10,"C'mon, Morgan. Time to show Captain what you've learned!"
d_counseling_mast_04_11,...
d_counseling_mast_04_12,...
d_counseling_mast_04_13,...
d_counseling_mast_04_14,"Hey, why aren't you showing off for everyone else?"
d_counseling_mast_04_15,I spend some time feeding and playing with Morgan.
d_counseling_mast_05_1,"Hey, Captain."
d_counseling_mast_05_2,When do you think rum tastes the absolute best?
d_counseling_mast_05_3,When I'm drinking it with Helm.
d_counseling_mast_05_4,When I'm drinking it without Helm finding out.
d_counseling_mast_05_5,"Hmm, yeah."
d_counseling_mast_05_6,But scheduling a drinking session with Helm isn't easy.
d_counseling_mast_05_7,She's always busy saving the world!
d_counseling_mast_05_8,"But when you finally do get to drink with her, it's always worth the wait."
d_counseling_mast_05_9,"Hmm, I see."
d_counseling_mast_05_10,"Knocking back a few while on the job can be fun too, I guess."
d_counseling_mast_05_11,But drinking with your fellow crewmates is always more memorable.
d_counseling_mast_05_12,It's always a night of celebrating stories and reminiscing.
d_counseling_mast_05_13,I listen to Mast's tales about all the epic adventures of the Aegis Squad.
d_counseling_mast_06_1,Captain!
d_counseling_mast_06_2,Do you wanna be my crewmate?
d_counseling_mast_06_3,"I am the captain, so technically you should be my crewmate."
d_counseling_mast_06_4,Aren't we already crewmates?
d_counseling_mast_06_5,"Hm, that does make sense."
d_counseling_mast_06_6,"But really, does it even matter who's who as long as we're all in it together?"
d_counseling_mast_06_7,"If the ship goes down, we're all going down with it."
d_counseling_mast_06_8,"Ahaha, yeah!"
d_counseling_mast_06_9,I just wanted to try saying
d_counseling_mast_06_10,the famous line from Straw Hat Voyage to you.
d_counseling_mast_06_11,"It feels pretty great to say out loud, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_mast_06_12,Mast tells me a story about a young boy with a dream of becoming the Pirate Lord.
d_counseling_mast_07_1,I'm running late for my counseling session with Mast.
d_counseling_mast_07_2,"As I approach the Commander's Room, I hear someone singing."
d_counseling_mast_07_3,Yo-ho! Yo-ho! A pirate's life for Mast and Morgan♪
d_counseling_mast_07_4,We'll enjoy the pirates' feast until Captain comes♪
d_counseling_mast_07_5,Hahaha! I'm here to take over your ship!
d_counseling_mast_07_6,Hahaha! Let's set sail and go on an adventure!
d_counseling_mast_07_7,"Wait, what? Aren't we on the same side?"
d_counseling_mast_07_8,That's right! Hand over everything nice and easy!
d_counseling_mast_07_9,"Uh, um, you wouldn't really betray me, would you, Captain?"
d_counseling_mast_07_10,You must have been cursed by some ancient dark magic.
d_counseling_mast_07_11,"Don't worry, I'll find a way to break it!"
d_counseling_mast_07_12,Sure thing!
d_counseling_mast_07_13,"Let me finish up this pirate feast real quick, then we can board the ship!"
d_counseling_mast_07_14,"The winds are just right, this voyage is going to be amazing!"
d_counseling_mast_07_15,I play a loud and fun pirate game with Mast.
d_counseling_mast_08_1,"Captain, Morgan's been surprisingly chatty lately..."
d_counseling_mast_08_2,What do you think he wants?
d_counseling_mast_08_3,Maybe you haven't been playing with him enough?
d_counseling_mast_08_4,Maybe you stole his food?
d_counseling_mast_08_5,I don't think that's how it works.
d_counseling_mast_08_6,He's too wise to be entertained by mere games.
d_counseling_mast_08_7,It's more like he's playing with me!
d_counseling_mast_08_8,"Hey, come on, Captain."
d_counseling_mast_08_9,"I would never steal a bird's food, no matter how hungry I am!"
d_counseling_mast_08_10,"But, I may have snuck a taste of his jello when I was drunk on rum..."
d_counseling_mast_08_11,Best snack with alcohol! Best snack with alcohol!
d_counseling_mast_08_12,How many times did you do that for him to learn that phrase?
d_counseling_mast_08_13,I listen to Morgan chatter on for a while.
d_counseling_mast_09_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_mast_09_2,"This might be a tough question to answer, but..."
d_counseling_mast_09_3,"Captain, do you think I can become a pirate?"
d_counseling_mast_09_4,"Whether or not they can achieve it, a true pirate chases their dream, isn't it?"
d_counseling_mast_09_5,"Well, first you should probably take off that navy uniform."
d_counseling_mast_09_6,...
d_counseling_mast_09_7,"Thanks, Captain."
d_counseling_mast_09_8,"I was starting to lose faith, but you reminded me why I started down this path in the first place."
d_counseling_mast_09_9,...
d_counseling_mast_09_10,"If I take this off, I'll lose the only remaining ship I have."
d_counseling_mast_09_11,Won't that make me stray farther from my dream?
d_counseling_mast_09_12,Mast and I talk about her career development.
d_counseling_mast_10_1,A voyage always starts with gathering your crew!
d_counseling_mast_10_2,"So, if you were going to set sail,"
d_counseling_mast_10_3,who would be the first person you'd look for?
d_counseling_mast_10_4,I'd have to find a parrot to be my lucky charm.
d_counseling_mast_10_5,I'd have to find someone to sail the ship for me.
d_counseling_mast_10_6,What? But...
d_counseling_mast_10_7,I thought I was the one taking care of Morgan.
d_counseling_mast_10_8,It turns out I'm the one who relies on him more!
d_counseling_mast_10_9,"Haha, you know what you're talking about!"
d_counseling_mast_10_10,"And don't you worry, I'll always be here sailing with the Admire."
d_counseling_mast_10_11,"If you're looking for adventure, don't go to anyone else. Make sure you come find me!"
d_counseling_mast_10_12,Mast and I team up to form the ultimate voyage dream team.
d_counseling_mast_11_1,Why did you join the Admire?
d_counseling_mast_11_2,"Was it for the thrill of adventure, the money, or your crewmates?"
d_counseling_mast_11_3,I wanted to take back the surface we lost.
d_counseling_mast_11_4,I wanted to see new places I've never seen before.
d_counseling_mast_11_5,"Ah, I see."
d_counseling_mast_11_6,"That's just like you, Captain. As firm and resolute as a rock."
d_counseling_mast_11_7,"Yes, that's exactly why I love sailing too."
d_counseling_mast_11_8,"For those of us who were born and raised in the Ark,"
d_counseling_mast_11_9,the view from the ship's deck is priceless.
d_counseling_mast_11_10,Mast and I discuss the true meaning of sailing.
d_counseling_mast_12_1,"You know, since the olden days,"
d_counseling_mast_12_2,"the most famous pirates were always known by their nicknames, not their real names."
d_counseling_mast_12_3,"So, what do you think mine would be?"
d_counseling_mast_12_4,The Last Voyager.
d_counseling_mast_12_5,The Mean Pirate Queen.
d_counseling_mast_12_6,"Hmm, that sounds a bit melancholic, but also kinda cool."
d_counseling_mast_12_7,"It reflects reality, but if it were up to me,"
d_counseling_mast_12_8,"I'd strive to make the ""last"" the ""first""."
d_counseling_mast_12_9,Seriously? That's the best you could come up with?
d_counseling_mast_12_10,How about...
d_counseling_mast_12_11,The Ocean's Barrel! The Ocean's Barrel!
d_counseling_mast_12_12,You two are playing a trick on me?
d_counseling_mast_12_13,Mast and I seek to find a memorable nickname that truly represents her identity.
d_counseling_mast_13_1,Being a pirate
d_counseling_mast_13_2,is all about having amazing adventures and experiencing things that are out of this world!
d_counseling_mast_13_3,Are there any legends or mysterious phenomena that you've always wanted to experience first-hand?
d_counseling_mast_13_4,I want to explore the Devil's Triangle.
d_counseling_mast_13_5,I want to come across a cursed pirate ship.
d_counseling_mast_13_6,... The Devil's Triangle?
d_counseling_mast_13_7,Alva particles in there are so dense
d_counseling_mast_13_8,that it blocks all communication.
d_counseling_mast_13_9,And there are crazy tornadoes that destroy ships left and right.
d_counseling_mast_13_10,"Actually, I've looked into that place too."
d_counseling_mast_13_11,I heard that some people fled there during the first invasion.
d_counseling_mast_13_12,I wonder if they're still alive and kicking... I'm itching to go on an adventure there again!
d_counseling_mast_13_13,"Oh, I see what you're going for."
d_counseling_mast_13_14,You're talking about the outlaws' pirate ship that drifts eternally
d_counseling_mast_13_15,"because they're cursed for being too greedy, right?"
d_counseling_mast_13_16,But isn't that just a Pirates of the Caspian rip-off?
d_counseling_mast_13_17,"Come on, Captain, use your imagination."
d_counseling_mast_13_18,Mast and I indulge in our imaginations with enthusiasm.
d_counseling_mast_14_1,"Hey, did you ever hear that in the pirate world,"
d_counseling_mast_14_2,it's kind of a tradition to have an animal companion like Morgan?
d_counseling_mast_14_3,"Do you have any animals that you trust, Captain?"
d_counseling_mast_14_4,I think a parrot is best for a pirate.
d_counseling_mast_14_5,I think a monkey would be nice.
d_counseling_mast_14_6,... Ha!
d_counseling_mast_14_7,"Parrots are the ultimate pirate companion, no doubt about it!"
d_counseling_mast_14_8,"Ummm, I don't know about that."
d_counseling_mast_14_9,"The monkey would probably play tricks on me,"
d_counseling_mast_14_10,like leaving banana peels in my path or something...
d_counseling_mast_14_11,"Nah, a monkey just isn't for me."
d_counseling_mast_14_12,Mast and I discuss the importance of animal companions.
d_counseling_mast_15_1,"Anchor is a great crewmate, but sometimes she leaves me scratching my head."
d_counseling_mast_15_2,"Like, when we were cleaning, out of nowhere, she just yells, ""Starfish!"" What's up with that?"
d_counseling_mast_15_3,Don't try to understand girls going through puberty.
d_counseling_mast_15_4,Maybe that's Anchor's special code system.
d_counseling_mast_15_5,I know other girls her age
d_counseling_mast_15_6,and they don't act like that.
d_counseling_mast_15_7,"But they always storm out of the room and slam the door behind them, saying not to follow."
d_counseling_mast_15_8,Might as well cloak her in mystery
d_counseling_mast_15_9,"since we can't decipher her anyway, huh?"
d_counseling_mast_15_10,That's not a bad approach.
d_counseling_mast_15_11,We discuss the peculiar behaviors of Anchor that we've observed so far.
d_counseling_mast_16_1,Sometimes I feel bad for the Admire.
d_counseling_mast_16_2,"It was built to be a majestic warship,"
d_counseling_mast_16_3,"racing across the open ocean, slicing through the waves."
d_counseling_mast_16_4,But it's stuck dry-docked most of the time.
d_counseling_mast_16_5,I'll make sure we get out to sea soon.
d_counseling_mast_16_6,That's why we're always stoked when an opportunity comes around.
d_counseling_mast_16_7,Thank you.
d_counseling_mast_16_8,"I want to help make that happen, too."
d_counseling_mast_16_9,"But sadly, I don't have many means to do so."
d_counseling_mast_16_10,"Yeah, that makes sense."
d_counseling_mast_16_11,"In fact, I get so pumped that I can't even sleep when I think about the possibility of unexpected adventures."
d_counseling_mast_16_12,I bet the Admire feels the same way.
d_counseling_mast_16_13,"We send an email to Andersen, expressing our desire for more seafaring missions."
d_counseling_mast_17_1,"Usually, famous pirates have rivals who are every bit as notorious."
d_counseling_mast_17_2,"So who do you want to compete with the most, Captain?"
d_counseling_mast_17_3,"Helm's enemy, starfish."
d_counseling_mast_17_4,"The humans' enemy, Rapture Queen."
d_counseling_mast_17_5,...
d_counseling_mast_17_6,"Even though Helm doesn't know, she'd be so grateful if she found out about this."
d_counseling_mast_17_7,But you're already a captain! Shouldn't you be dreaming bigger?
d_counseling_mast_17_8,!!
d_counseling_mast_17_9,That's what I call a pirate with plenty of potential! You're one ambitious captain!
d_counseling_mast_17_10,"Count me in, I'll be following you all the way until we crush all our rivals!"
d_counseling_mast_17_11,We analyze the rivalries depicted in famous pirate movies.
d_counseling_mast_18_1,...
d_counseling_mast_18_2,Mast seems to have a lot on her mind.
d_counseling_mast_18_3,Wait patiently.
d_counseling_mast_18_4,Did anything happen?
d_counseling_mast_18_5,... Captain.
d_counseling_mast_18_6,I think I need to go somewhere.
d_counseling_mast_18_7,May I leave first?
d_counseling_mast_18_8,Go ahead.
d_counseling_mast_18_9,Are you not gonna ask why?
d_counseling_mast_18_10,We're crewmates who trust each other. No words needed.
d_counseling_mast_18_11,!!
d_counseling_mast_18_12,Thanks so much. Let's have rum together next time.
d_counseling_mast_18_13,"Yeah, things like this happen all the time."
d_counseling_mast_18_14,"The higher-ups always rush Helm, which forces Helm to rush us."
d_counseling_mast_18_15,"But this time, things are pretty dicey."
d_counseling_mast_18_16,...
d_counseling_mast_18_17,"If it's possible, I don't want to let you see me like this."
d_counseling_mast_18_18,We end the session early due to Mast's personal reasons.
d_counseling_mast_19_1,Anchor is just so intriguing.
d_counseling_mast_19_2,Did you know that she has a radar inside her own body?
d_counseling_mast_19_3,But it malfunctions sometimes
d_counseling_mast_19_4,and she just bumps her head against the cabin wall to fix it. It's like it gets magically repaired or something.
d_counseling_mast_19_5,I thought radars were supposed to have precise components?
d_counseling_mast_19_6,I guess that's really the way to fix everything in this world.
d_counseling_mast_19_7,Exactly!
d_counseling_mast_19_8,"I don't know what'll happen if more problems arise in the future,"
d_counseling_mast_19_9,especially if she keeps fixing it like that.
d_counseling_mast_19_10,What...?
d_counseling_mast_19_11,"Uh, anyway, she often spaces out and gets lost in her own thoughts."
d_counseling_mast_19_12,I just feel so intrigued when I watch her do that though.
d_counseling_mast_19_13,"I spend some time listening to Mast talk about everything Anchor's radar can do, all 99 of them."
d_counseling_mast_20_1,Is Deputy Chief Andersen your immediate boss?
d_counseling_mast_20_2,What's he like anyway?
d_counseling_mast_20_3,He's definitely worthy of respect.
d_counseling_mast_20_4,He gives me way too much work. Does he think I don't have anything else to do?
d_counseling_mast_20_5,"Yeah, I can see that too."
d_counseling_mast_20_6,"He seems calm and mature,"
d_counseling_mast_20_7,and he's reliable too—never goes back on his word.
d_counseling_mast_20_8,"But you know, my superior, Burningum, isn't so bad either in those aspects."
d_counseling_mast_20_9,!!
d_counseling_mast_20_10,"Let me just say, I feel you, Captain. It's crazy how all employees feel the same way."
d_counseling_mast_20_11,"Like, we work under Burningum,"
d_counseling_mast_20_12,but it's also our job to manage the Admire.
d_counseling_mast_20_13,And he always forgets that fact.
d_counseling_mast_20_14,We have a secret discussion about our superiors.
d_counseling_nero_01_1,Scoops.
d_counseling_nero_01_2,I feel like going somewhere high up.
d_counseling_nero_01_3,How about the upper part of the Command Center?
d_counseling_nero_01_4,Do you want me to carry you on my back?
d_counseling_nero_01_5,...
d_counseling_nero_01_6,That's too high for me.
d_counseling_nero_01_7,Just... can I lie on your lap instead?
d_counseling_nero_01_8,!!
d_counseling_nero_01_9,"Well... That'd be pawesome,"
d_counseling_nero_01_10,but it might be tiring for you.
d_counseling_nero_01_11,"Just let me lie on your lap,"
d_counseling_nero_01_12,that'll be enough.
d_counseling_nero_01_13,I let Nero lie on my lap.
d_counseling_nero_02_1,...
d_counseling_nero_02_2,...
d_counseling_nero_02_3,... Meow?
d_counseling_nero_02_4,... Sleepy?
d_counseling_nero_02_5,What are you doing?
d_counseling_nero_02_6,*Yawn* I'm feeling sleepy.
d_counseling_nero_02_7,Can we talk while lying down today?
d_counseling_nero_02_8,*Yawn* Yes.
d_counseling_nero_02_9,You're very observant.
d_counseling_nero_02_10,Can I lie down now?
d_counseling_nero_02_11,Nero curls up on the couch in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_nero_03_1,...
d_counseling_nero_03_2,Nero approaches me and rubs her head against my arm.
d_counseling_nero_03_3,Touch her head.
d_counseling_nero_03_4,Want some treats?
d_counseling_nero_03_5,Nero moves away.
d_counseling_nero_03_6,I don't want pats. Do you have any food?
d_counseling_nero_03_7,I feel like snacking.
d_counseling_nero_03_8,"You're so tactful, Scoops."
d_counseling_nero_03_9,I actually feel like snacking right now.
d_counseling_nero_03_10,It'd be purrfect if you could give me some.
d_counseling_nero_03_11,I give Nero some cat treats.
d_counseling_nero_04_1,I'm curious about something.
d_counseling_nero_04_2,Do you also want to understand cats?
d_counseling_nero_04_3,I can already communicate with you though.
d_counseling_nero_04_4,I don't mind if I don't understand them. They're cute anyway.
d_counseling_nero_04_5,Are you sure about that?
d_counseling_nero_04_6,Then... Meow.
d_counseling_nero_04_7,??
d_counseling_nero_04_8,Meow meow. Meow meow meow meow. Meow.
d_counseling_nero_04_9,Did you get that?
d_counseling_nero_04_10,... No.
d_counseling_nero_04_11,I knew it.
d_counseling_nero_04_12,!!
d_counseling_nero_04_13,...
d_counseling_nero_04_14,Do you really find me cute when you look at me?
d_counseling_nero_04_15,I nod.
d_counseling_nero_04_16,Then look to your heart's content.
d_counseling_nero_04_17,I can make you feel better.
d_counseling_nero_04_18,Nero teaches me the language of cats.
d_counseling_nero_05_1,Scoops.
d_counseling_nero_05_2,Be honest with me.
d_counseling_nero_05_3,Which one do you like better: cats or dogs?
d_counseling_nero_05_4,I prefer cats.
d_counseling_nero_05_5,I prefer dogs.
d_counseling_nero_05_6,"I knew it,"
d_counseling_nero_05_7,it's so obvious.
d_counseling_nero_05_8,Nero sways her tail lightly.
d_counseling_nero_05_9,"Of course, cats are the best choice."
d_counseling_nero_05_10,!!!
d_counseling_nero_05_11,"Is that a well-considered answer, meow?"
d_counseling_nero_05_12,Do you really like dogs over cats?
d_counseling_nero_05_13,That hurts...
d_counseling_nero_05_14,... I was just kidding.
d_counseling_nero_05_15,... Right?
d_counseling_nero_05_16,I knew it.
d_counseling_nero_05_17,Nero begins purring happily.
d_counseling_nero_06_1,Scoops.
d_counseling_nero_06_2,Nero takes out a can of tuna.
d_counseling_nero_06_3,Shall I open it for you?
d_counseling_nero_06_4,Thank you.
d_counseling_nero_06_5,Meow!
d_counseling_nero_06_6,"You're so considerate, I love it."
d_counseling_nero_06_7,I've been waiting for you to return
d_counseling_nero_06_8,so I could ask you to open it for me.
d_counseling_nero_06_9,??
d_counseling_nero_06_10,Nero slaps the floor with her tail.
d_counseling_nero_06_11,This isn't for you. I want you to open it for me.
d_counseling_nero_06_12,I've been waiting for you to come back
d_counseling_nero_06_13,because I trust you to lend me a helping paw.
d_counseling_nero_06_14,I help Nero open the canned tuna.
d_counseling_nero_07_1,"Scoops, things have been tough lately."
d_counseling_nero_07_2,Any idea why?
d_counseling_nero_07_3,Because Biscuit keeps asking you to play with her?
d_counseling_nero_07_4,What could be causing someone like you to struggle?
d_counseling_nero_07_5,!!
d_counseling_nero_07_6,"You're a genius, Scoops."
d_counseling_nero_07_7,What do you mean?
d_counseling_nero_07_8,Every creature has its own struggles.
d_counseling_nero_07_9,Is something bothering you?
d_counseling_nero_07_10,Well...
d_counseling_nero_07_11,Biscuit has been asking me to play with her a lot lately.
d_counseling_nero_07_12,"She never seems to get tired, and if I agree to play with her, I have to do it all day."
d_counseling_nero_07_13,It's so exhausting.
d_counseling_nero_07_14,I lay a blanket out on the couch so Nero can rest.
d_counseling_nero_08_1,Meow...
d_counseling_nero_08_2,Nero cleans her face with her hands.
d_counseling_nero_08_3,*Lick* *Lick*
d_counseling_nero_08_4,Purr... Purr...
d_counseling_nero_08_5,Meow.
d_counseling_nero_08_6,I'm done washing my face.
d_counseling_nero_08_7,You wash your face just like a cat.
d_counseling_nero_08_8,"As a Nikke, you can't just clean yourself like that and call it a day."
d_counseling_nero_08_9,That's because I am a cat.
d_counseling_nero_08_10,Meow.
d_counseling_nero_08_11,"Anyway, I'm going now."
d_counseling_nero_08_12,Nero stalks away.
d_counseling_nero_08_13,!!
d_counseling_nero_08_14,I hate water!
d_counseling_nero_08_15,Nero scurries away.
d_counseling_nero_08_16,"I set out to search for Nero, who has left."
d_counseling_nero_09_1,...
d_counseling_nero_09_2,"It's time for our counseling session, but Nero hasn't shown up yet."
d_counseling_nero_09_3,Call out loudly for Nero.
d_counseling_nero_09_4,Quietly swing the cat teaser in the air.
d_counseling_nero_09_5,*Clack*
d_counseling_nero_09_6,A sound comes from the window.
d_counseling_nero_09_7,*Thud thud thud*
d_counseling_nero_09_8,...?
d_counseling_nero_09_9,But Nero still doesn't appear.
d_counseling_nero_09_10,*Clack*
d_counseling_nero_09_11,A sound comes from the window.
d_counseling_nero_09_12,*Thud thud thud*
d_counseling_nero_09_13,Meow!
d_counseling_nero_09_14,There she is!
d_counseling_nero_09_15,Let's start our session—
d_counseling_nero_09_16,Aren't you going to swing the toy anymore?
d_counseling_nero_09_17,I guess I'll have to schedule the session with her for another time.
d_counseling_nero_10_1,*Sniff sniff*
d_counseling_nero_10_2,Meow? You smell so good.
d_counseling_nero_10_3,Could it be the milk I drank?
d_counseling_nero_10_4,Huh? I don't know what smell you're talking about.
d_counseling_nero_10_5,!!
d_counseling_nero_10_6,Milk...!
d_counseling_nero_10_7,My nose knows best.
d_counseling_nero_10_8,This sweet scent is definitely from delicious milk.
d_counseling_nero_10_9,No... I smell something delicious.
d_counseling_nero_10_10,*Sniff sniff sniff*
d_counseling_nero_10_11,!!
d_counseling_nero_10_12,It's the smell of milk.
d_counseling_nero_10_13,I'm sure you drank milk.
d_counseling_nero_10_14,Do you have any left?
d_counseling_nero_10_15,"I want some too. Some sweet, sweet milk."
d_counseling_nero_10_16,... No.
d_counseling_nero_10_17,!!
d_counseling_nero_10_18,Nero and I go buy some milk together.
d_counseling_nero_11_1,"Scoops, what kind of weather do you like?"
d_counseling_nero_11_2,Rainy weather.
d_counseling_nero_11_3,Sunny weather.
d_counseling_nero_11_4,I see.
d_counseling_nero_11_5,I don't like rainy days.
d_counseling_nero_11_6,"Too much water falling, and no sun. It gets so cold."
d_counseling_nero_11_7,... I hate the cold.
d_counseling_nero_11_8,You like sunny days too?
d_counseling_nero_11_9,Me too.
d_counseling_nero_11_10,The sun makes everything warm.
d_counseling_nero_11_11,"My fur becomes fluffy, and my paws feel warm."
d_counseling_nero_11_12,I love feeling warm.
d_counseling_nero_11_13,Nero and I hope for a bright and sunny day tomorrow.
d_counseling_nero_12_1,It feels so cozy and comfortable hanging out with Admi.
d_counseling_nero_12_2,Purr... I just feel that she smells like me.
d_counseling_nero_12_3,Because you're both children?
d_counseling_nero_12_4,Because you're both cats?
d_counseling_nero_12_5,Children?
d_counseling_nero_12_6,"I don't know about Admi, but I'm not a child."
d_counseling_nero_12_7,I was trying to say that we both smell like cats.
d_counseling_nero_12_8,Purr... That may be the case.
d_counseling_nero_12_9,Admi also smells like a cat.
d_counseling_nero_12_10,I'm not sure if it's because she likes cats or because she resembles one...
d_counseling_nero_12_11,"Either way, I feel pawsitive and comfortable whenever I see her."
d_counseling_nero_12_12,Nero and I talk about Admi while thinking of her.
d_counseling_nero_13_1,Biscuit gets really scared when she sees Leona
d_counseling_nero_13_2,even when Leona didn't do anything.
d_counseling_nero_13_3,I wonder why.
d_counseling_nero_13_4,Maybe her existence itself is intimidating?
d_counseling_nero_13_5,Maybe Biscuit is just too timid?
d_counseling_nero_13_6,Meow?
d_counseling_nero_13_7,I'm not sure about that.
d_counseling_nero_13_8,"Leona is just bigger in size, but she's not scary."
d_counseling_nero_13_9,"No matter how I think of it, I believe it's because Biscuit is simply a scaredy-dog."
d_counseling_nero_13_10,Do you think so too?
d_counseling_nero_13_11,I agree.
d_counseling_nero_13_12,"Leona is just bigger in size, but she's not scary."
d_counseling_nero_13_13,Biscuit is just a scaredy-dog.
d_counseling_nero_13_14,That's just how small animals are.
d_counseling_nero_13_15,Why don't you help them get closer?
d_counseling_nero_13_16,No way.
d_counseling_nero_13_17,Why not?
d_counseling_nero_13_18,It's too much work.
d_counseling_nero_13_19,I talk to Nero about how to get along well with friends.
d_counseling_nero_14_1,Meow.
d_counseling_nero_14_2,Biscuit has been so annoying lately...
d_counseling_nero_14_3,Should I tell her to stay away from you?
d_counseling_nero_14_4,But wouldn't it be a shame if she's not around?
d_counseling_nero_14_5,?!
d_counseling_nero_14_6,... No.
d_counseling_nero_14_7,I need her to pass me treats when I'm feeling lazy.
d_counseling_nero_14_8,"When I'm hot, I need her to fan me..."
d_counseling_nero_14_9,"And when I'm cold, I need her to tuck me in."
d_counseling_nero_14_10,!!
d_counseling_nero_14_11,... True.
d_counseling_nero_14_12,"She's a bother sometimes, but when she's not here, I miss her."
d_counseling_nero_14_13,"When I'm hot, I need her to fan me."
d_counseling_nero_14_14,"And when I'm cold, I need her to tuck me in."
d_counseling_nero_14_15,So...
d_counseling_nero_14_16,I need her.
d_counseling_nero_14_17,Because she's an important friend?
d_counseling_nero_14_18,...
d_counseling_nero_14_19,No need to state the obvious.
d_counseling_nero_14_20,Nero and I discuss Biscuit.
d_counseling_nero_15_1,"Scoops, I'm in big trouble."
d_counseling_nero_15_2,Mary and Pepper said that they'll come looking for me if I don't get a check-up within this week.
d_counseling_nero_15_3,Where do you think would be a good place to hide?
d_counseling_nero_15_4,How about the Commander's Room?
d_counseling_nero_15_5,I'll be with you. Let's go to the hospital.
d_counseling_nero_15_6,Thanks.
d_counseling_nero_15_7,Then I'll hide under the bed.
d_counseling_nero_15_8,"... No, scratch that. I should stay in the closet."
d_counseling_nero_15_9,That doesn't seem right...
d_counseling_nero_15_10,!!
d_counseling_nero_15_11,"No way, I'm not going to the hospital. It's too scary."
d_counseling_nero_15_12,I'll find somewhere to hide on my own.
d_counseling_nero_15_13,"I comfort Nero, who is clearly frightened."
d_counseling_nero_16_1,...
d_counseling_nero_16_2,"It's time for counseling, but Nero hasn't shown up yet."
d_counseling_nero_16_3,No cat toys are in sight either.
d_counseling_nero_16_4,Open an empty box and place it on the floor.
d_counseling_nero_16_5,Make sounds with an empty plastic bag.
d_counseling_nero_16_6,*Clack*
d_counseling_nero_16_7,There's a rustling sound from the bed.
d_counseling_nero_16_8,?!
d_counseling_nero_16_9,Nero rolls out from under the bed.
d_counseling_nero_16_10,"Oh, it's a box."
d_counseling_nero_16_11,Nero jumps into the box.
d_counseling_nero_16_12,"Okay, let's start our session—"
d_counseling_nero_16_13,Being in this box makes me sleepy...
d_counseling_nero_16_14,*Clack*
d_counseling_nero_16_15,There's a rustling sound from the bed.
d_counseling_nero_16_16,?!
d_counseling_nero_16_17,Nero rolls out from under the bed.
d_counseling_nero_16_18,... It's not a treat.
d_counseling_nero_16_19,*Thud thud thud thud*
d_counseling_nero_16_20,Nero dashes out of the door!
d_counseling_nero_16_21,!!
d_counseling_nero_16_22,I guess I'll have to reschedule Nero's session for another time.
d_counseling_nero_17_1,Scoops.
d_counseling_nero_17_2,What will you do when you feel lonely?
d_counseling_nero_17_3,I'll hold your hand.
d_counseling_nero_17_4,I'll grab your tail.
d_counseling_nero_17_5,!!
d_counseling_nero_17_6,My hands will get sweaty if we hold hands for too long.
d_counseling_nero_17_7,But...
d_counseling_nero_17_8,"If that's what you want, I won't mind."
d_counseling_nero_17_9,So... Make sure to visit me when you're lonely.
d_counseling_nero_17_10,!!
d_counseling_nero_17_11,No way!
d_counseling_nero_17_12,Nero hides her tail.
d_counseling_nero_17_13,"My tail is off-limits, even for you."
d_counseling_nero_17_14,I talk to Nero about ways to relieve loneliness.
d_counseling_nero_18_1,...
d_counseling_nero_18_2,Nero stares out the window in a daze.
d_counseling_nero_18_3,...
d_counseling_nero_18_4,Leave her be.
d_counseling_nero_18_5,... What are you up to?
d_counseling_nero_18_6,... Meow.
d_counseling_nero_18_7,"After a while, Nero turns her attention to her surroundings."
d_counseling_nero_18_8,Found ya.
d_counseling_nero_18_9,!!
d_counseling_nero_18_10,You startled me.
d_counseling_nero_18_11,"I was staring out of the window, and I didn't notice you were here."
d_counseling_nero_18_12,What were you looking at?
d_counseling_nero_18_13,Nothing.
d_counseling_nero_18_14,??
d_counseling_nero_18_15,Just gazing out of the window makes me feel content.
d_counseling_nero_18_16,Would you like to join me?
d_counseling_nero_18_17,"I take a brief break, gazing out of the window with Nero."
d_counseling_nero_19_1,Meowww...
d_counseling_nero_19_2,*Shiver*
d_counseling_nero_19_3,It's too cold today...
d_counseling_nero_19_4,Put some clothes over her.
d_counseling_nero_19_5,Put a blanket over her.
d_counseling_nero_19_6,!!
d_counseling_nero_19_7,Meow... I don't want more clothes...
d_counseling_nero_19_8,I want a cozy blanket...
d_counseling_nero_19_9,... and you.
d_counseling_nero_19_10,Meow!
d_counseling_nero_19_11,Blankets are the best when it's cold outside.
d_counseling_nero_19_12,Purr... Purr...
d_counseling_nero_19_13,It'll be warmer if we cuddle together...
d_counseling_nero_19_14,Can't we do that?
d_counseling_nero_19_15,I snuggle under the blanket with Nero to stay warm.
d_counseling_nero_20_1,"Scoops, do you know any place that will brighten up the day?"
d_counseling_nero_20_2,The shelter where you're at.
d_counseling_nero_20_3,The supermarket where I can find everything I need.
d_counseling_nero_20_4,"Hmm, that answer feels a bit too deliberate..."
d_counseling_nero_20_5,Nero sways her tail lightly.
d_counseling_nero_20_6,But it does make me happy.
d_counseling_nero_20_7,You can come by often.
d_counseling_nero_20_8,!!
d_counseling_nero_20_9,... Meow.
d_counseling_nero_20_10,That's not the answer I expected.
d_counseling_nero_20_11,You're too practical.
d_counseling_nero_20_12,But they have cat toys and treats there. Isn't that great?
d_counseling_nero_20_13,!!
d_counseling_nero_20_14,... It seems like the supermarket could be a pawesome place.
d_counseling_nero_20_15,Nero and I decide to go to a place that makes us both happy.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_1,"Hey, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_2,I'm so jealous that you can swim.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_3,I actually prefer staying out of the water.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_4,"Then let's go swim, just like you mentioned."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_5,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_6,Then how about you come and help me cut up some watermelons?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_7,You don't have to rub it in...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_8,"Fine, I'll stay here and watch you swim."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_9,But you've gotta come back and hang out with me once you're done!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_01_10,I have a good time with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_1,Check out the sky.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_2,Don't you think sunset is prettier than sunrise?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_3,How about we crack open a soda and take in the sunset?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_4,"It is, but neither of them is more beautiful than you."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_5,Sounds great!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_6,"Here, take a seat."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_7,...?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_8,"So, if I'm not mistaken,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_9,"you would say that to every girl you meet, right?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_02_10,I have a good time with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_1,"Oh no, it's finally happening!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_2,I'm running out of soda!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_3,How can I live without my precious carbonated beverages?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_4,How about I give you some of mine?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_5,You can take this as an opportunity to wean yourself off of soda and drink more water.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_6,!!!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_7,Commander...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_8,What an awesome guy you are!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_9,Huh?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_10,"If you're gonna lecture me, at least give me a bottle of soda first."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_03_11,I give Anis a bottle of soda and continue to chat with her for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_1,"Firepower is for ordinary occasions, and waterpower is for when she's out at sea."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_2,I wonder what new variations will appear in the future?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_3,That's probably all of them.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_4,What about windpower?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_5,"Apparently you don't know Neon that well, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_6,I think there are many more variations which have yet to appear.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_7,Sounds like you know Neon pretty well.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_8,I can see it now; her ascending to the top of a mountain peak and starting to clamor for windpower training.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_9,... Makes me exhausted just thinking about it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_04_10,Anis and I talk about Neon for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_1,"Ugh, the sun is baking me alive."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_2,"How are you holding up, Commander?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_3,Waddya say we both take shelter under this beach umbrella?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_4,I'm fine. I applied sunscreen.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_5,Much appreciated.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_6,"Ah, so you've lubed yourself up beforehand, have you? Admirable perspicacity..."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_7,... but a bit boring.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_8,"I don't know if the umbrella is too small, or you're too bulky, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_9,You're hardly half-covered.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_10,We'll have to get closer.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_05_11,Anis and I deliberate over different ways to shade ourselves from the sun.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_1,Commander! Look over here!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_2,Isn't the color of this shell lovely?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_3,It's the same color as your hair.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_4,It's similar to Rapi's hair.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_5,Is it?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_6,I suppose it is a beige hue. No wonder I was drawn to it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_7,I'll have to take it with me when we go back.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_8,Hey! What are you mentioning Rapi for?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_9,"My hair's brown too, y'know."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_10,That was super insensitive of you! I'm really put out right now...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_06_11,Anis and I continue to hunt for shells for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_1,"Hey, Commander,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_2,"sorry to bother you so late at night,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_3,but I couldn't sleep.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_4,Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_5,Want to hang out for a while?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_6,A lullaby? Seriously?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_7,Don't be such a goof.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_8,Let's just hang out for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_9,Is that okay?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_10,You're not too tired? Awesome!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_11,What should we do?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_07_12,Anis and I have a fun time hanging out for the evening.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_1,"Ahhh, isn't the sea wonderful?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_2,I wonder if I was a fish in my previous life?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_3,Fish can swim though.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_4,You may be onto something.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_5,...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_6,Good point.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_7,Maybe I was a grain of sand then.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_8,"I must have gotten my fill of swimming around back then, so that's why in this life, I sink like a stone when I try to swim."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_9,I don't feel as bad when I think about it that way.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_10,"Some fish look kind of ugly, though. I'm not a fan."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_08_11,Anis and I discuss the concept of past lives for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_1,Hum♪ Hum hum hum♪
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_2,Under the red hot sun♬
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_3,What song is that?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_4,"You and me, just two of us♬"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_5,"Oh, this little ditty?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_6,It's from a singer I used to be obsessed with.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_7,What the...?!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_8,"You know this song, Commander?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_9,I'm stunned! It's not a very popular song.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_10,It's from a singer I used to be obsessed with.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_09_11,Anis and I sing together for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_1,"Commander, I just saw a bird I've never seen before!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_2,"When it flew past, it made this warbling sound, like ""Huoh, huoh!"""
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_3,I wanna test you: do you know what kind of bird it was?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_4,A seagull.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_5,A sparrow.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_6,Oh! I didn't know we had an amateur ornithologist in our midst.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_7,The only reason I'm familiar with it is because Helm told me about it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_8,"She said that since seagulls live by the sea, we rarely get the chance to see them."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_9,But they have a very unique call.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_10,"Er... Commander,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_11,"we've spent more than enough time up on the surface, so I'm sure you've seen your fair share of sparrows."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_12,"Sparrows don't go ""huoh, huoh"", they go ""chirp chirp""."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_13,"According to Helm, what I saw recently is a seagull."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_10_14,I discuss seagulls with Anis for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_2,what do you think of my swimsuit?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_3,It's so nice that it's almost a shame to wear it. You should store it away safely and treasure it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_4,You should take good care of it so you can keep wearing it in the future.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_5,What?!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_6,"No way, no how! I won't get burned twice."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_7,"If I keep treating it like a piece of treasure, it only means I won't be able to wear it at all in the end."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_8,My thoughts exactly.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_9,Now you know why I've been so coy about wearing it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_10,I'm glad you like it!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_11_11,I discuss swimsuits with Anis for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_1,"Commander, something's happened."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_2,I think I've grown addicted to drinking soda on the beach.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_3,What if I find out I don't like soda as much when we return to the Outpost?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_4,You can just come back to the seaside again.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_5,Something tells me you're gonna keep drinking soda no matter where you are.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_6,!!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_7,"Thanks for saying that, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_8,I'm so touched...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_9,"Even if I never end up going to the beach again, I won't blame you for it."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_10,"Yeah, you're probably right."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_11,"I'm a hopeless soda addict, and I'll be knockin' 'em back for years to come."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_12,But that's not really what I'm getting at.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_13,What I'm trying to say is that drinking a soda is even better when you're at the beach.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_14,I thought you'd pick up on that...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_12_15,Anis and I have a nice chat.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_1,Even the most serene surroundings often have a dark underbelly hidden just underneath.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_2,"Well, I have a bloodcurdling story to share with you, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_3,Anis! Be-behind you!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_4,Lay it on me.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_5,Gaahhh!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_6,You scared the bejesus out of me!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_7,"Well, you gave me quite the fright as well when you grabbed me and threw yourself in my arms."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_8,I only did that because you frightened me!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_9,...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_10,Let's just take a breather and relax until I calm down.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_11,"It's late at night, and you're alone in the Commander's Room."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_12,"Suddenly, there's a knock on the door. On the other side, a voice claims to have found a note, and they walk in."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_13,In comes a figure who raises their hand and slowly moves towards you.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_14,...?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_15,"Commander, are you all right? I haven't even gotten to the scary part yet, but you look as white as a sheet."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_16,I think I've experienced this story in my dreams.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_17,"Whoa, no kidding! You think it's some kind of premonition, maybe?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_18,"Anyway, you're more easily scared than I thought."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_13_19,Anis continues to regale me with bone-chilling stories.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_1,"Mmmm, nothing beats a good barbecue!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_2,Food on the surface just hits different.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_3,What's the tastiest thing you've sampled up here so far?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_4,Grilled seafood.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_5,Barbecue.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_6,Really?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_7,"Ever since we got here, I've had enough seafood to last multiple lifetimes, so I'm a bit over it."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_8,...!!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_9,Did I really just say that I was tired of food from the surface?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_10,"Man, it's scary how fast we can get used to, and move past, things."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_11,Right?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_12,"For all Neon babbles on about firepower, it turns out she's got a real knack for cooking."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_13,Would you like another one?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_14_14,I have a good time talking about food with Anis.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_1,"Ugh, the sun's a real scorcher today."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_2,Can you apply some sunscreen on my back?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_3,Sure. Turn over.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_4,Do Nikkes even need sunscreen?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_5,Okay!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_6,"Just keep your mind out of the gutter, and be sure to apply it evenly."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_7,...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_8,"No,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_9,but did you ever consider the real reason why I was asking?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_10,Why don't you think it over again and reconsider?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_15_11,I spend some time applying sunscreen on Anis.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_1,Ahahaha!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_2,"Come and get me, Commander!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_3,I'm gonna get you!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_4,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_5,"So you know this game, too?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_6,I saw it on TV and have always wanted to try it.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_7,"All right, come try and catch me!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_8,"Come on,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_9,put those legs in motion
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_10,and come catch me!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_16_11,"I run after Anis for a while, attempting to catch her."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_1,Check this out!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_2,I made this sand castle all by myself. What do you think?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_3,... Castle? Where?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_4,It's breathtaking. I feel like we could move in.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_5,It's right there on the ground! Can't you see?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_6,"It may not be as majestic as a real castle, but what can you expect when it's made of sand?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_7,"*Sigh* Well, you're nothing if not frank."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_8,"I suppose that's part of your charm, though."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_9,"... That's laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_10,"You don't actually think you could live in this, do you?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_11,Like for real?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_17_12,I join Anis and play in the sand for a while.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_1,"The more I look at Rapi's swimsuit, the more I like it."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_2,How should I put it... it's very... tasteful.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_3,"What do you think, Commander?"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_4,"I personally prefer your swimsuit, Anis."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_5,Rapi's swimsuit is indeed very cool.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_6,Really?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_7,I guess I'll just have to be more confident about my swimsuit.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_8,"Heehee, I should go show it off to Rapi."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_9,You think so too?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_10,...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_11,Wait a second. I need to get Rapi to take off her swimsuit.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_18_12,Anis runs over to Rapi.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_1,"Commander, look!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_2,"Yan couldn't peel her eyes off this thing, so I snagged it."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_3,Do you know what it is?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_4,A pearl?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_5,A nice-looking rock?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_6,Good eye!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_7,Apparently this is used a lot for jewelry.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_8,Isn't it gorgeous?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_9,"I'm disappointed in you, Commander. I thought you'd be more perceptive."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_10,Yan would never be interested in an ordinary hunk of rock.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_11,"Judging by how shiny it is, it must be some kind of gemstone."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_19_12,Anis and I continue to admire the gemstone.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_1,Hey!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_2,*Slap*
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_3,"Ahahaha! You should see the look on your face, Commander!"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_4,... Is this a starfish?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_5,I can't see! Help!!
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_6,Yep.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_7,"I saw Anchor slinging starfish and thought I'd give it a try,"
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_8,but your reaction is way more subdued than I thought it'd be. That's no fun.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_9,...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_10,Can I throw one more?
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_11,It's just a cute lil' starfish. You can pry it off using your hands.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_12,I saw Anchor slinging starfish and thought I'd give it a try.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_13,Pfff...
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_14,"I'm sorry, it's just that you're so adorable when you're confused."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_15,"You can throw one at me the next time, Commander."
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_16,You've got my permission.
d_counseling_anis_sprklingsummer_20_17,Anis and I take turns tossing starfish at one another.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_1,"Subordinate,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_2,I still can't believe I'm actually out at sea.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_3,Am I dreaming?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_4,Pinch Helm's cheek.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_5,Hold Helm's hand.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_6,Ow!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_7,I guess that proves it's not a dream.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_8,But you didn't have to pinch so hard...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_9,It kind of hurts.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_10,...!!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_11,Your hand is so warm.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_12,"Since I can feel that warmth so clearly, I know for sure that I'm not dreaming."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_01_13,Helm and I quietly gaze at the ocean.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_1,Do you have a robe or anything I can wear?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_2,Preferably one that reaches the ankles.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_3,Can't say I do.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_4,Let me see...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_5,Are you sure?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_6,Then can I have a look? Just in case there's one lying around.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_7,Thanks.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_8,"Even though I'm already wearing a jacket,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_9,it still feels awkward being in this swimsuit.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_02_10,I help Helm look for something she can wear over her swimsuit.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_1,Subordinate.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_2,"If you see someone drowning,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_3,what is the first thing you should do?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_4,Tell you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_5,Jump into the water.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_6,Correct.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_7,"I'm the best swimmer out of all of us,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_8,"so if you ever see someone having trouble staying above water, tell me right away."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_9,Wrong answer.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_10,"You wouldn't be able to bring Nikkes back ashore,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_11,"so if you do ever see someone drowning, tell me straight away."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_03_12,Helm tells me more swimming safety rules.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_1,...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_2,Helm stares at the beach as if in a reverie.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_3,What are you thinking?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_4,...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_5,"... Oh, nothing."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_6,I'm sorry for thinking about other things while I'm with you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_7,...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_8,"Oh, I didn't see you there. Sorry, I was thinking about something."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_9,"It's fine, don't worry about me."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_10,... Thank you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_04_11,I have a meaningful session with Helm.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_1,The breeze at night is so refreshing.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_2,It'd be a shame to spend the entire night here.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_3,Should we take an evening stroll?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_4,Want a beer?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_5,Good idea.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_6,I can't wait!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_7,"Subordinate,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_8,you should know the adverse health effects of consuming alcohol.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_9,"... Besides, I can't drink."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_10,How about going on a walk instead?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_05_11,Helm and I take a nice nighttime stroll along the beach.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_1,I feel like swimsuits don't really suit me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_2,What do you think?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_3,You look good now.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_4,Your uniform suits you better.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_5,"Thank you,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_6,"but no matter what I do, I feel awkward in them."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_7,Huh...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_8,You think so too?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_9,I just feel like I look so silly in this.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_10,I want to change back into my usual clothes as soon as possible.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_06_11,I talk with Helm about clothes.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_1,It's kind of spooky at night.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_2,It feels like a ghost could pop up at any minute.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_3,"... So. You think I'm human, huh?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_4,"Don't be afraid, I'll protect you."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_5,Pfft...!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_6,!!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_7,"It's funny seeing you say this with that face, Subordinate."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_8,Thanks for giving me a good laugh. I don't feel so scared anymore.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_9,"No,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_10,I should be the one protecting you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_11,*Swish swish swish*
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_12,Eeeek!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_13,Helm leans over and grabs me tightly.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_14,I think there's something behind us!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_07_15,I comfort Helm throughout our session.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_1,Isn't the Admire splendid?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_2,It's so massive and majestic... just looking at it excites me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_3,You look like you were meant to be on it.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_4,I agree.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_5,!!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_6,You really know how to make a person feel great.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_7,Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_8,Looks like I'm not the only one who feels that way.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_9,I'm sure everyone thinks the same thing when they lay eyes on the Admire.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_08_10,Helm and I talk about the Admire.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_1,Check out this tiny fish.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_2,Isn't it adorable?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_3,... Blech.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_4,Looks a lot like you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_5,!!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_6,You don't like fish?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_7,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_8,"Actually, I'm not a huge fan either."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_9,I just figured it was appropriate to show you this since we're at the beach.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_10,Like me?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_11,Sure. Because it's adorable.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_12,I take it that's supposed to be a compliment?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_13,Yeah. All right. Thanks.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_09_14,I talk with Helm about fish.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_1,I'm craving some fresh fruit today.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_2,"What's your favorite fruit, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_3,"If we're talking about summertime, watermelons."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_4,"If we're talking about summertime, peaches."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_5,So you also like watermelons.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_6,"A lot of people seem to like watermelons,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_7,but I prefer peaches.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_8,"You like peaches, too?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_9,You're just like me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_10,"It doesn't matter whether they're crunchy or soft, I just love them."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_11,Although I don't get too many chances to try them out.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_10_12,Helm and I converse about our favorite fruits.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_1,"Anis and Mary have both been pestering me,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_2,"telling me to rest,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_3,but I've been resting this entire time.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_4,I don't know what they're getting at when they say 'rest'.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_5,Maybe something like lying in a hammock?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_6,Maybe clearing your mind and thinking about nothing.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_7,I'm afraid that would be a bit difficult.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_8,Frima has been sleeping in the hammock since early this morning.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_9,It'd be rude of me to wake her and wrestle it away from her.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_10,Like meditation?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_11,Close your eyes and focus on the sound of the sea.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_12,...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_13,Hmm... My mind does feel less cluttered now.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_14,"Thanks, Subordinate."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_11_15,Helm and I take some time to have a proper rest.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_1,I bought a pearl necklace from Yan today.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_2,"I initially wasn't sold on it,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_3,but Yan kept saying how this necklace would be perfect for me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_4,"She said it looks great on me, so..."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_5,I think it suits you well.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_6,Another victim of her peerless salesmanship.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_7,You think so?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_8,I thought I'd fallen for her old sales tricks.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_9,"Well, I suppose I can wear this the next time there's a party on the ship."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_10,I know...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_11,"You think if I return it, she'd give me a refund?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_12_12,Helm and I talk more about the pearl necklace.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_1,"You don't look well, Subordinate."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_2,Are you all right?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_3,I might have a mild bout of heatstroke.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_4,"I was out of sorts, but now that you're here, I feel energized."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_5,It's easy to get overheated in this weather.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_6,Do you want to lie on my lap for a while?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_7,"If you don't feel better after resting for a bit, I'll take you to see Mary."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_8,"If you can still joke around like that, I'd say you're doing just fine."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_9,Although it wouldn't hurt for you to go see Mary.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_13_10,Helm takes me to visit Mary.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_1,The stars tonight seem extra bright.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_2,Is it true that your wishes will come true if you wish upon a star?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_3,"If it is, what wish would you make, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_4,That we can one day reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_5,That I'll win the lottery.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_6,We have the same wish.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_7,I want to reclaim the surface as soon as possible
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_8,and explore the sea there.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_9,"If I were to win the lottery,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_10,we probably wouldn't need to drum up donations anymore.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_11,I wouldn't have to kiss up to potential sponsors either.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_12,... But this whole thing with shooting stars is just a fantasy.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_14_13,Helm and I watch the stars together and make wishes.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_1,"Finally, I can swim to my heart's content."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_2,"Are you a good swimmer, Subordinate?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_3,I can't even doggy paddle.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_4,I could swim laps around you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_5,How about I give you some lessons?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_6,It's a good idea to at least learn the basics.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_7,Really?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_8,How about we go for a swim after this session?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_9,You've got me feeling competitive again.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_15_10,"After our session is over, I go swimming with Helm."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_1,Anis threw a starfish at me today.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_2,I thought I was done with that while we're here.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_3,"I'll give it up to her though, her aim is impressive."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_4,I got plastered with one as well.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_5,Are you okay?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_6,You too?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_7,Pfft.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_8,I'm imagining you two hurling starfish at each other.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_9,I have to thank you for providing me with such a funny image.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_10,I'm fine.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_11,Anchor has been giving me some training on how to dodge starfish.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_12,I should be able to evade it next time.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_16_13,Helm and I talk more about starfish.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_1,Mast told me I should take more pictures.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_2,But what should I photograph?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_3,Me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_4,The ocean.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_5,Why you?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_6,"If anything, I think Mast was referring to the ocean."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_7,Mast will love that.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_8,I can also get some photos of birds that look like Morgan.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_9,And starfish that Anchor likes so much.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_10,And...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_17_11,Helm and I take a plethora of photos together.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_1,Anis and I agreed to have a two-on-two water fight.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_2,Would you like to join us?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_3,Sure. I'll be on your team.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_4,Sure. I'll be on Anis' team.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_5,...!!
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_6,I'll do everything I can to make sure you win.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_7,"Wait, no, so that we win, I mean..."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_8,I think Anis is going to team up with Neon.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_9,"But if you really want to be on her side,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_10,I'll team up with Neon.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_11,... I guess I'll go inform Anis.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_18_12,Helm and I have a good time having a water fight.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_1,"Subordinate, is there any nickname you'd like me to call you by?"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_2,"Since we're at the beach,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_3,I thought it might be better to use a new nickname.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_4,{AccountData.NickName}?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_5,I like Subordinate just fine.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_6,Huh?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_7,"Now that I think of it, I've never called you by your actual name."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_8,"Okay, for today, that's what I'll call you."
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_9,Really?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_10,... If you say so.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_11,Feels like kind of a waste though...
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_19_12,Helm and I continue discussing the notion of nicknames.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_1,... Subordinate.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_2,Is there something on my face?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_3,Why do you keep staring at me?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_4,Because you're gorgeous.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_5,Because you look so powerful when you're by the sea.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_6,You're incorrigible.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_7,"I already told you before,"
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_8,don't look at me like that unless you really mean it.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_9,I do?
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_10,Thank you.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_11,That's the first time anyone has ever said that to me.
d_counseling_helm_aquamarine_20_12,I spend a meaningful session with Helm.
d_counseling_anchor_01_1,Fishing is a big hobby of mine.
d_counseling_anchor_01_2,"Are you good at fishing, Captain?"
d_counseling_anchor_01_3,I'm a master angler.
d_counseling_anchor_01_4,Catching people is my specialty.
d_counseling_anchor_01_5,Really? I'm pretty good myself.
d_counseling_anchor_01_6,Waddya say we go fishing together sometime?
d_counseling_anchor_01_7,We could end up catching a real whopper!
d_counseling_anchor_01_8,... Huh?
d_counseling_anchor_01_9,With a fishing rod?
d_counseling_anchor_01_10,How is that even possible? Wouldn't a person be too heavy?
d_counseling_anchor_01_11,And what kind of bait do you use?
d_counseling_anchor_01_12,Anchor and I discuss the ins and outs of fishing.
d_counseling_anchor_02_1,...
d_counseling_anchor_02_2,Anchor stares at the marine life in the box.
d_counseling_anchor_02_3,"Marine life have faces only a mother could love, don't you think?"
d_counseling_anchor_02_4,That's part of their charm.
d_counseling_anchor_02_5,They sure do.
d_counseling_anchor_02_6,Well said!
d_counseling_anchor_02_7,"Apparently once you get hooked on something ugly, there's no going back."
d_counseling_anchor_02_8,I can personally attest to how accurate that is.
d_counseling_anchor_02_9,"They're positively repugnant, but I can't get enough of these little guys."
d_counseling_anchor_02_10,...
d_counseling_anchor_02_11,"I doubt they'd appreciate hearing that, though."
d_counseling_anchor_02_12,We better apologize to them.
d_counseling_anchor_02_13,Anchor and I talk more about marine life.
d_counseling_anchor_03_1,All these radar waves have been giving me a headache lately.
d_counseling_anchor_03_2,What should I do when my head hurts?
d_counseling_anchor_03_3,I'll take you to go see Mary.
d_counseling_anchor_03_4,Touch Anchor's forehead.
d_counseling_anchor_03_5,"I despise going to the hospital,"
d_counseling_anchor_03_6,"but if you're going with me, I'll... nah, I still won't go."
d_counseling_anchor_03_7,I've got nothing but bad memories about the hospital.
d_counseling_anchor_03_8,...!!
d_counseling_anchor_03_9,Your hand is so cold. I think my headache isn't as intense anymore.
d_counseling_anchor_03_10,Can you leave your hand on my forehead for a while?
d_counseling_anchor_03_11,I talk with Anchor about headaches.
d_counseling_anchor_04_1,I wonder...
d_counseling_anchor_04_2,"If I hadn't become a Nikke, what would I be doing?"
d_counseling_anchor_04_3,You'd be a starfish.
d_counseling_anchor_04_4,You'd be a member of the navy rescue team.
d_counseling_anchor_04_5,Huh?
d_counseling_anchor_04_6,What do you mean?
d_counseling_anchor_04_7,How on earth could I become a starfish?
d_counseling_anchor_04_8,We're two totally different species.
d_counseling_anchor_04_9,Navy rescue team?
d_counseling_anchor_04_10,That would be fantastic.
d_counseling_anchor_04_11,"I'm all about rescuing people,"
d_counseling_anchor_04_12,"and I like being in the water, too."
d_counseling_anchor_04_13,Anchor and I share our hopes and dreams with each other.
d_counseling_anchor_05_1,Helm said she's gonna buy me a swimsuit.
d_counseling_anchor_05_2,What kind of swimsuit should I choose?
d_counseling_anchor_05_3,Something cute with frills.
d_counseling_anchor_05_4,A one-piece with starfish designs.
d_counseling_anchor_05_5,"Frills...?
Cute...?"
d_counseling_anchor_05_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_anchor_05_7,"It's hardly something I would have chosen, but if you think it'll suit me, I'll consider it."
d_counseling_anchor_05_8,"We all know how much I like starfish,"
d_counseling_anchor_05_9,but that may look a bit strange.
d_counseling_anchor_05_10,I talk with Anchor about swimsuits.
d_counseling_anchor_06_1,What else can I throw in people's faces?
d_counseling_anchor_06_2,Starfish are getting a bit stale for me.
d_counseling_anchor_06_3,Jellyfish?
d_counseling_anchor_06_4,Octopus?
d_counseling_anchor_06_5,"Jellyfish can be poisonous, so that'd be dangerous."
d_counseling_anchor_06_6,People could get stung if I'm not careful.
d_counseling_anchor_06_7,That's not a bad idea.
d_counseling_anchor_06_8,It'd certainly stick to people's faces easily.
d_counseling_anchor_06_9,I'll give it a try and throw one at Mast next time.
d_counseling_anchor_06_10,I have an enjoyable session with Anchor.
d_counseling_anchor_07_1,"Captain,"
d_counseling_anchor_07_2,is there anyone else here aside from us?
d_counseling_anchor_07_3,"Yeah, there's someone... right beside you!"
d_counseling_anchor_07_4,"No, why?"
d_counseling_anchor_07_5,Nice try.
d_counseling_anchor_07_6,Actually...
d_counseling_anchor_07_7,"there are several people surrounding you, Captain."
d_counseling_anchor_07_8,Huh.
d_counseling_anchor_07_9,My radar is picking up other bodies. Must be malfunctioning.
d_counseling_anchor_07_10,"You okay, Captain? You look awfully pale."
d_counseling_anchor_07_11,I spend time with Anchor telling ghost stories.
d_counseling_anchor_08_1,I'm too lazy to clean today.
d_counseling_anchor_08_2,Helm will probably give me an earful if I ask the marine life to take over for me.
d_counseling_anchor_08_3,How could they help you clean?
d_counseling_anchor_08_4,I can help you.
d_counseling_anchor_08_5,It was a joke.
d_counseling_anchor_08_6,"Actually, although it'd take them a bit longer, I'm sure they could do it."
d_counseling_anchor_08_7,There's a reason people say that marine creatures are practically the janitors of the ocean.
d_counseling_anchor_08_8,...!
d_counseling_anchor_08_9,"I honestly wasn't saying that to try and get you to help me,"
d_counseling_anchor_08_10,"but since you're offering, who am I to refuse?"
d_counseling_anchor_08_11,I clean with Anchor for a while.
d_counseling_anchor_09_1,"The bird Mast always brings around is named Morgan, right?"
d_counseling_anchor_09_2,"I want to give the marine life names, too."
d_counseling_anchor_09_3,Got any good suggestions?
d_counseling_anchor_09_4,"Sea Cucumbo, Spoony Worm, and Starry?"
d_counseling_anchor_09_5,Let's put our brains together and think.
d_counseling_anchor_09_6,"... Well, we finally discovered something you're terrible at, Captain. Thinking of names."
d_counseling_anchor_09_7,Sorry? I didn't catch that.
d_counseling_anchor_09_8,"Nothing.
Any other suggestions? Let's think together."
d_counseling_anchor_09_9,Sure.
d_counseling_anchor_09_10,I don't want ordinary names.
d_counseling_anchor_09_11,"I want names that really mean something, like..."
d_counseling_anchor_09_12,Anchor and I think up names for her sea creatures.
d_counseling_anchor_10_1,I have to prepare food for the boat party.
d_counseling_anchor_10_2,What should I prepare?
d_counseling_anchor_10_3,Can't go wrong with seafood.
d_counseling_anchor_10_4,Nutrium would be a good choice for a party.
d_counseling_anchor_10_5,"I don't think that will do, since Helm doesn't like seafood."
d_counseling_anchor_10_6,"After all, a party is where everyone has fun and enjoys food."
d_counseling_anchor_10_7,That might be the right call.
d_counseling_anchor_10_8,"There could be some people who don't like seafood,"
d_counseling_anchor_10_9,but virtually no one will dislike Nutrium.
d_counseling_anchor_10_10,Anchor and I plan out the menu for the upcoming boat party.
d_counseling_anchor_11_1,"Sometimes when I look at the Admire, I can't help but feel it's lonely."
d_counseling_anchor_11_2,What do you think I can do to make it not as lonely?
d_counseling_anchor_11_3,Raise marine life on it.
d_counseling_anchor_11_4,"It looks happy to me, because the Aegis squad is around."
d_counseling_anchor_11_5,That'd definitely give it some company.
d_counseling_anchor_11_6,And it'd be like the sea was by its side.
d_counseling_anchor_11_7,You're right!
d_counseling_anchor_11_8,"But if Helm finds out, I'll never hear the end of it."
d_counseling_anchor_11_9,I'll have to see how long I can raise them before she shows up.
d_counseling_anchor_11_10,That makes sense.
d_counseling_anchor_11_11,But I don't think we alone can fill that void.
d_counseling_anchor_11_12,Maybe it's because it's not able to sail the high seas...
d_counseling_anchor_11_13,I talk with Anchor about the Admire.
d_counseling_anchor_12_1,You know the white uniforms Helm and Mast wear?
d_counseling_anchor_12_2,Do you think that kind of outfit would suit me?
d_counseling_anchor_12_3,Your current outfit suits you perfectly.
d_counseling_anchor_12_4,I am a tad curious how you'd look in uniform.
d_counseling_anchor_12_5,"I'm glad to hear that,"
d_counseling_anchor_12_6,"but sometimes I want to wear something a bit more charismatic, like Helm or Mast."
d_counseling_anchor_12_7,So you're curious too.
d_counseling_anchor_12_8,"The next time I see Helm, I'll see if I can try on a uniform."
d_counseling_anchor_12_9,I'm also curious myself.
d_counseling_anchor_12_10,I talk with Anchor about uniforms.
d_counseling_anchor_13_1,I heard there used to be an aquarium on the surface.
d_counseling_anchor_13_2,Why doesn't the Ark have one?
d_counseling_anchor_13_3,Should we build one in the Outpost?
d_counseling_anchor_13_4,We should hurry and reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_anchor_13_5,Here?
d_counseling_anchor_13_6,...
d_counseling_anchor_13_7,"Even if we do, it'd probably only be full of water and no actual fish."
d_counseling_anchor_13_8,"And when we do, we'll open our own sprawling aquarium!"
d_counseling_anchor_13_9,Just thinking about it gets me pumped.
d_counseling_anchor_13_10,"I'd go there every day, and you could come with me, Captain."
d_counseling_anchor_13_11,Anchor and I continue to imagine our future aquarium.
d_counseling_anchor_14_1,Why can't marine life speak?
d_counseling_anchor_14_2,I get kinda jealous whenever I see Morgan talking to Mast.
d_counseling_anchor_14_3,Mimic marine life speaking.
d_counseling_anchor_14_4,You're connected to them on a spiritual level. They don't have to speak.
d_counseling_anchor_14_5,...
d_counseling_anchor_14_6,Anchor takes out a starfish from her pocket.
d_counseling_anchor_14_7,Sorry.
d_counseling_anchor_14_8,... Anchor puts the starfish back in her pocket.
d_counseling_anchor_14_9,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_anchor_14_10,We can understand each other even without talking.
d_counseling_anchor_14_11,How could I forget something so important?
d_counseling_anchor_14_12,Anchor and I have a pleasant session together.
d_counseling_anchor_15_1,Mast has been making me watch pirate movies every day this week.
d_counseling_anchor_15_2,I think I've got nearly every line memorized by now.
d_counseling_anchor_15_3,I'll keep the pirate-related movies somewhere out of reach.
d_counseling_anchor_15_4,Just tell her you want to watch something else.
d_counseling_anchor_15_5,You would do that for me?
d_counseling_anchor_15_6,I will never forget the kindness you've done me.
d_counseling_anchor_15_7,"If I do that,"
d_counseling_anchor_15_8,Mast will only badger me about pirate novels or something else.
d_counseling_anchor_15_9,Then she'll start going on about the history of pirates or other trivia. I'd rather watch the movie in peace.
d_counseling_anchor_15_10,Anchor and I discuss how to deal with Mast.
d_counseling_anchor_16_1,... Captain.
d_counseling_anchor_16_2,I'm so sleepy.
d_counseling_anchor_16_3,We can end our session early today.
d_counseling_anchor_16_4,You can take a nap on my bed if you want.
d_counseling_anchor_16_5,*Yawn* Thanks. So sleepy...
d_counseling_anchor_16_6,I'm barely even registering what I'm saying right now.
d_counseling_anchor_16_7,Would that be okay?
d_counseling_anchor_16_8,"Thanks. I spent all day yesterday watching seaweed,"
d_counseling_anchor_16_9,and barely got any sleep.
d_counseling_anchor_16_10,I lend Anchor my bed so she can catch up on some sleep.
d_counseling_anchor_17_1,"Captain,"
d_counseling_anchor_17_2,how long can you stay underwater?
d_counseling_anchor_17_3,Probably longer than you can.
d_counseling_anchor_17_4,32 seconds on the dot.
d_counseling_anchor_17_5,Are you sure? I can hold my breath for around 10 minutes.
d_counseling_anchor_17_6,Let's have a contest.
d_counseling_anchor_17_7,Loser gets a starfish to the face.
d_counseling_anchor_17_8,I appreciate the fact that you're always honest.
d_counseling_anchor_17_9,I'll teach you how to stay underwater longer.
d_counseling_anchor_17_10,I spend some time diving with Anchor.
d_counseling_anchor_18_1,"Helm seems to have something on her mind, but she won't tell me what it is."
d_counseling_anchor_18_2,What should I do?
d_counseling_anchor_18_3,Wait for her to open up.
d_counseling_anchor_18_4,Threaten her with a starfish.
d_counseling_anchor_18_5,You're probably right.
d_counseling_anchor_18_6,Helm is the type to open up only after she's sorted everything out in her head.
d_counseling_anchor_18_7,"Although plastering her with a starfish would definitely force her to fess up,"
d_counseling_anchor_18_8,my curiosity isn't strong enough to warrant such extreme methods.
d_counseling_anchor_18_9,Anchor and I talk about Helm.
d_counseling_anchor_19_1,"Captain,"
d_counseling_anchor_19_2,"I've got a question for you, and you need to guess the answer."
d_counseling_anchor_19_3,Are seahorses good or bad at swimming?
d_counseling_anchor_19_4,They're good at it.
d_counseling_anchor_19_5,They're bad at it.
d_counseling_anchor_19_6,Nope.
d_counseling_anchor_19_7,Seahorses can't swim very well at all.
d_counseling_anchor_19_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_anchor_19_9,Seahorses are far from adept swimmers.
d_counseling_anchor_19_10,I only found that out recently.
d_counseling_anchor_19_11,Anchor and I continue to quiz each other on random trivia.
d_counseling_anchor_20_1,"I feel so happy whenever Mast and Helm are near me,"
d_counseling_anchor_20_2,but I don't know how to express that and tell them how I feel.
d_counseling_anchor_20_3,Imagine them as sea creatures.
d_counseling_anchor_20_4,I don't think you have to tell them. I'm sure they already know.
d_counseling_anchor_20_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_anchor_20_6,That may be a bit of a mental leap. They don't exactly look like marine life.
d_counseling_anchor_20_7,Any other suggestions?
d_counseling_anchor_20_8,But how would they know if I've never told them?
d_counseling_anchor_20_9,You can always tell if you're special to someone by looking into their eyes.
d_counseling_anchor_20_10,Really? That's great.
d_counseling_anchor_20_11,"Honestly, Helm and Mast are right up there with sea creatures for me. You too, Captain."
d_counseling_anchor_20_12,I listen to Anchor talk about Helm and Mast.
d_counseling_marciana_01_1,"Commander, would you take a look at this?"
d_counseling_marciana_01_2,This is a drawing Rei gave me.
d_counseling_marciana_01_3,It's cute. She's a talented artist.
d_counseling_marciana_01_4,Is this supposed to be a fox?
d_counseling_marciana_01_5,I think so too.
d_counseling_marciana_01_6,Marciana's smile remains plastered on her face for a while.
d_counseling_marciana_01_7,Rei apparently has an innate talent for drawing.
d_counseling_marciana_01_8,...
d_counseling_marciana_01_9,...
d_counseling_marciana_01_10,I was told it was a picture of me.
d_counseling_marciana_01_11,No wonder it looks so cool.
d_counseling_marciana_01_12,I personally think it's more on the adorable side.
d_counseling_marciana_01_13,I have a conversation with Marciana about Rei's drawings.
d_counseling_marciana_02_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_02_2,Do I look angry to you right now?
d_counseling_marciana_02_3,You look the same as always.
d_counseling_marciana_02_4,Yes. Is there something wrong?
d_counseling_marciana_02_5,Hmm... I'll take that as a yes.
d_counseling_marciana_02_6,I've got to try and make another expression.
d_counseling_marciana_02_7,"Nothing's wrong. Unless you consider seeing a cat along the road worth getting angry over, which I don't."
d_counseling_marciana_02_8,"I'm the furthest thing from upset, yet I keep getting told I look angry."
d_counseling_marciana_02_9,Coming off as irate has its own appeal.
d_counseling_marciana_02_10,!!
d_counseling_marciana_02_11,I spend time with Marciana researching expressions.
d_counseling_marciana_03_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_03_2,"Ein has been using this expression lately, ""hip""."
d_counseling_marciana_03_3,What does it mean to be hip?
d_counseling_marciana_03_4,When you're unique and novel in your look or demeanor.
d_counseling_marciana_03_5,Just take a look at me. I'm hip.
d_counseling_marciana_03_6,"Okay, I think I understand."
d_counseling_marciana_03_7,"If I want to understand Ein, I need to look into what's hip these days."
d_counseling_marciana_03_8,... Sorry?
d_counseling_marciana_03_9,I'm not quite sure I understand.
d_counseling_marciana_03_10,Would it be okay if I continued observing you?
d_counseling_marciana_03_11,I spend time determining what hip is with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_04_1,I sometimes get worried that my shortcomings as a teacher
d_counseling_marciana_04_2,will negatively affect my students.
d_counseling_marciana_04_3,"You don't have any shortcomings, Marciana."
d_counseling_marciana_04_4,"You're always doing your best, and that's all you can do."
d_counseling_marciana_04_5,...
d_counseling_marciana_04_6,"Nobody is perfect, and I'm no exception."
d_counseling_marciana_04_7,"Still, thank you for saying that."
d_counseling_marciana_04_8,I suppose that's true...
d_counseling_marciana_04_9,"The kids will see that, and it's sure to leave a positive effect on them."
d_counseling_marciana_04_10,"Thank you for the encouragement, Commander."
d_counseling_marciana_04_11,I have a serious counseling session with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_05_1,"Commander, I have a question."
d_counseling_marciana_05_2,How do you get the most out of your designated rest times?
d_counseling_marciana_05_3,Close your eyes and take deep breaths.
d_counseling_marciana_05_4,Bring my hands up and cover Marciana's eyes.
d_counseling_marciana_05_5,Phewwwwww!
d_counseling_marciana_05_6,Like this?
d_counseling_marciana_05_7,"Nothing really feels different, but I'll keep trying."
d_counseling_marciana_05_8,...!?
d_counseling_marciana_05_9,Clear your mind and only focus on being comfortable.
d_counseling_marciana_05_10,Your hands are warm.
d_counseling_marciana_05_11,They put me at ease.
d_counseling_marciana_05_12,I spend time taking a rest with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_06_1,Do you want to try some of this?
d_counseling_marciana_06_2,It's a cake with a topper of a fox hugging a penguin.
d_counseling_marciana_06_3,Awwww so cute!
d_counseling_marciana_06_4,What flavor is it?
d_counseling_marciana_06_5,You think so?
d_counseling_marciana_06_6,It reminds me of you hugging Rei.
d_counseling_marciana_06_7,...!
d_counseling_marciana_06_8,...
d_counseling_marciana_06_9,... I didn't think of it like that.
d_counseling_marciana_06_10,Um...
d_counseling_marciana_06_11,I bought it once I saw the fox and the penguin.
d_counseling_marciana_06_12,I didn't even pay attention to what flavor it was.
d_counseling_marciana_06_13,I spend some time eating some delicious cake with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_07_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_07_2,These small desserts I've got here are called animal macarons.
d_counseling_marciana_07_3,"I don't think I'll be able to eat them, though."
d_counseling_marciana_07_4,What should I do with them?
d_counseling_marciana_07_5,How about giving them to the students?
d_counseling_marciana_07_6,I could eat some.
d_counseling_marciana_07_7,That's a brilliant idea!
d_counseling_marciana_07_8,The students will be super excited about that.
d_counseling_marciana_07_9,I'll hand them out first thing tomorrow.
d_counseling_marciana_07_10,"So... you're going to devour this happy little smiling doggie, right in front of me?"
d_counseling_marciana_07_11,...
d_counseling_marciana_07_12,...
d_counseling_marciana_07_13,I talk about macarons with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_08_1,Zwei has been pushing herself a bit too hard with her studies.
d_counseling_marciana_08_2,What should I say to help out?
d_counseling_marciana_08_3,Tell her not to overdo it.
d_counseling_marciana_08_4,Compliment her and say that she's been doing well.
d_counseling_marciana_08_5,I don't think that'll be enough to make her pump the brakes.
d_counseling_marciana_08_6,I'll have to think about it a little more.
d_counseling_marciana_08_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_marciana_08_8,"Yes, I think you may be right."
d_counseling_marciana_08_9,"I'm not especially skilled in this area, but I'll do my best."
d_counseling_marciana_08_10,Marciana and I talk about Zwei.
d_counseling_marciana_09_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_marciana_09_2,"I'm not sure how they got here, but there's a big pile of dolls lying on your desk."
d_counseling_marciana_09_3,Neon left them. Aren't they cute?
d_counseling_marciana_09_4,"Neon won a bunch of them at a claw machine, so she must have left a few there. Do you want one?"
d_counseling_marciana_09_5,...
d_counseling_marciana_09_6,...
d_counseling_marciana_09_7,Actually... they are kind of cute.
d_counseling_marciana_09_8,I'd say she left more than a few.
d_counseling_marciana_09_9,Anyway... I suppose I'll take one.
d_counseling_marciana_09_10,Marciana and I talk about dolls.
d_counseling_marciana_10_1,Have you ever heard of parfait?
d_counseling_marciana_10_2,"It's a layered dessert made with a variety of fruit, fresh cream, and custard."
d_counseling_marciana_10_3,"I have, but I've never tried it. Do you want to go try some together?"
d_counseling_marciana_10_4,"I have, and they're delicious. You should try some next time you get the chance."
d_counseling_marciana_10_5,!
d_counseling_marciana_10_6,I...
d_counseling_marciana_10_7,I'd like that.
d_counseling_marciana_10_8,Just me? On my own?
d_counseling_marciana_10_9,I'll think about it.
d_counseling_marciana_10_10,I talk about various desserts with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_11_1,Drones are all the rage with the student body.
d_counseling_marciana_11_2,I can't tell you how many classroom windows have gotten shattered because of them.
d_counseling_marciana_11_3,I'm trying to think about how I should handle this.
d_counseling_marciana_11_4,Is there any way to encourage them to fly their drones outside?
d_counseling_marciana_11_5,You should forbid them from flying drones inside the classroom.
d_counseling_marciana_11_6,!
d_counseling_marciana_11_7,"We could tell them that if they don't fly their drones inside the classroom,"
d_counseling_marciana_11_8,"we'll hold a drone flying contest or something like that. Thanks for the advice, Commander."
d_counseling_marciana_11_9,"If we crack the whip too harshly straight off, it'll result in a backlash and end poorly."
d_counseling_marciana_11_10,I've got to think of a way to spin this situation into a positive.
d_counseling_marciana_11_11,Marciana and I talk about the direction education is heading in.
d_counseling_marciana_12_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_marciana_12_2,what do you think a good teacher should be like?
d_counseling_marciana_12_3,Someone who guides the students and helps them achieve good results.
d_counseling_marciana_12_4,"Someone who recognizes the students for who they are, and helps them move towards a brighter future."
d_counseling_marciana_12_5,That's true. We should be a leading example for our students.
d_counseling_marciana_12_6,"However, teachers are far from infallible. We need to develop along with our students."
d_counseling_marciana_12_7,Hm...
d_counseling_marciana_12_8,I think you're right.
d_counseling_marciana_12_9,"It's something that may seem obvious to the outside observer, but in reality, it's a very difficult virtue to uphold."
d_counseling_marciana_12_10,I speak about what is the role of a teacher with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_13_1,"You know the data instrument I've got on my belly button, T.Va.?"
d_counseling_marciana_13_2,"I can't quite put my finger on it,"
d_counseling_marciana_13_3,but it feels like the data sync speed for T.Va. has been awfully sluggish lately.
d_counseling_marciana_13_4,Put a blanket over Marciana's stomach.
d_counseling_marciana_13_5,Have you spoken to M.M.R. or Missilis?
d_counseling_marciana_13_6,...!
d_counseling_marciana_13_7,"This should help, shouldn't it?"
d_counseling_marciana_13_8,...
d_counseling_marciana_13_9,"It does feel nice and warm. Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_marciana_13_10,"I have. Whenever I feel something is amiss, I put in a request to M.M.R."
d_counseling_marciana_13_11,"They said there wasn't anything wrong, though."
d_counseling_marciana_13_12,I suppose I'll just have to keep my eye on it.
d_counseling_marciana_13_13,Marciana and I talk about T.Va.
d_counseling_marciana_14_1,*Whirrrrr*
d_counseling_marciana_14_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_marciana_14_3,And Rei's test paper as well.
d_counseling_marciana_14_4,*Whirrrrr*
d_counseling_marciana_14_5,That drone seems to act like your assistant.
d_counseling_marciana_14_6,That drone sounds kinda cute when it's whizzing about.
d_counseling_marciana_14_7,Very much so.
d_counseling_marciana_14_8,I use it to maximize my work efficiency.
d_counseling_marciana_14_9,It helps me a lot.
d_counseling_marciana_14_10,?
d_counseling_marciana_14_11,...
d_counseling_marciana_14_12,"Now that you've mentioned it, I suppose that's true."
d_counseling_marciana_14_13,I talk about drones with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_15_1,"My tablet was upgraded recently,"
d_counseling_marciana_15_2,but I'm having a hard time getting used to it.
d_counseling_marciana_15_3,The interface is totally different from the last version.
d_counseling_marciana_15_4,I can help you familiarize yourself with it.
d_counseling_marciana_15_5,Isn't there an instruction manual or tutorial that'll walk you through everything?
d_counseling_marciana_15_6,...!
d_counseling_marciana_15_7,...
d_counseling_marciana_15_8,Sure. Press this button to turn it on.
d_counseling_marciana_15_9,"I checked, but couldn't find anything."
d_counseling_marciana_15_10,I'm sure I'll get used to it the more I use it.
d_counseling_marciana_15_11,I spend time looking at the tablet with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_16_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_16_2,"Rei saw a picture of a fox in class today,"
d_counseling_marciana_16_3,"and kept calling me ""Miss Foxy"" all day."
d_counseling_marciana_16_4,"I don't look like a fox, do I?"
d_counseling_marciana_16_5,You're clearly flirting with me right now.
d_counseling_marciana_16_6,Sure you do. Foxes are intelligent as well as easy on the eyes.
d_counseling_marciana_16_7,Excuse me?
d_counseling_marciana_16_8,What does that have to do with my question?
d_counseling_marciana_16_9,There are many ancient legends of fox spirits seducing people. So I'd say you're rather fox-like.
d_counseling_marciana_16_10,... I see.
d_counseling_marciana_16_11,...!
d_counseling_marciana_16_12,...
d_counseling_marciana_16_13,"I can't say I necessarily agree with you, but... thank you."
d_counseling_marciana_16_14,I spend time searching for fox pictures with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_17_1,M.M.R. sent me next year's curriculum.
d_counseling_marciana_17_2,"It clearly hadn't taken the individual needs of the students into account, so I sent it back for corrections."
d_counseling_marciana_17_3,"I just got a reply saying that if I want any changes made, I'll have to do them myself."
d_counseling_marciana_17_4,They clearly trust you.
d_counseling_marciana_17_5,I also think you should make the changes that you want.
d_counseling_marciana_17_6,...
d_counseling_marciana_17_7,They wouldn't leave something so important up to you if they didn't have faith in your abilities.
d_counseling_marciana_17_8,"... I guess I'll proceed with making the necessary changes, then."
d_counseling_marciana_17_9,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_marciana_17_10,I don't know if it's a good idea for me to operate entirely on my own on this.
d_counseling_marciana_17_11,"I'll make the necessary corrections, then contact M.M.R. again."
d_counseling_marciana_17_12,I spend time watching Marciana work.
d_counseling_marciana_18_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_18_2,"In order to broaden the knowledge of our students, we're planning a field trip."
d_counseling_marciana_18_3,Is there a location you would recommend?
d_counseling_marciana_18_4,How about the M.M.R.'s research lab?
d_counseling_marciana_18_5,How about the animal shelter run by Happy Zoo?
d_counseling_marciana_18_6,"We've already visited the research lab,"
d_counseling_marciana_18_7,and the students are going to want to go somewhere new.
d_counseling_marciana_18_8,I'll have to think it over for a little while.
d_counseling_marciana_18_9,!
d_counseling_marciana_18_10,The one filled with dogs and cats?
d_counseling_marciana_18_11,...
d_counseling_marciana_18_12,That would definitely be an intellectual field unfamiliar to our students.
d_counseling_marciana_18_13,"Thanks for the advice, Commander."
d_counseling_marciana_18_14,Marciana and I spitball more field trip ideas.
d_counseling_marciana_19_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_marciana_19_2,"you're a graduate of the military academy, aren't you?"
d_counseling_marciana_19_3,"When you were a student there, what expectations did you have of your instructors?"
d_counseling_marciana_19_4,I would have killed to have someone like you there.
d_counseling_marciana_19_5,I honestly can't really remember much. I was more focused on wanting better meals.
d_counseling_marciana_19_6,... Are you serious?
d_counseling_marciana_19_7,Deadly serious.
d_counseling_marciana_19_8,...
d_counseling_marciana_19_9,I'm honored to hear you say that.
d_counseling_marciana_19_10,...
d_counseling_marciana_19_11,"Food is important, no doubt,"
d_counseling_marciana_19_12,but I'm afraid that's not my area of expertise.
d_counseling_marciana_19_13,I share more about the military academy with Marciana.
d_counseling_marciana_20_1,Commander.
d_counseling_marciana_20_2,Ein keeps pestering me about taking a group photo.
d_counseling_marciana_20_3,She's even mentioned matching outfits.
d_counseling_marciana_20_4,What do you think would look best?
d_counseling_marciana_20_5,How about something nice and sporty?
d_counseling_marciana_20_6,How about some cute animal pajamas?
d_counseling_marciana_20_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_marciana_20_8,Thanks for your advice.
d_counseling_marciana_20_9,I'll bring it up to the students.
d_counseling_marciana_20_10,...
d_counseling_marciana_20_11,"It will be our first photo together, so I suppose it'd be good to wear something memorable."
d_counseling_marciana_20_12,...
d_counseling_marciana_20_13,Animal pajamas... could be fun.
d_counseling_marciana_20_14,Marciana and I spend some time contemplating what she and the others could wear in a group photo.
d_counseling_tia_01_1,"Teacher,"
d_counseling_tia_01_2,"when you were little, what did you want to be?"
d_counseling_tia_01_3,"A teacher, of course."
d_counseling_tia_01_4,Nothing.
d_counseling_tia_01_5,I knew you'd say that.
d_counseling_tia_01_6,You're like a dependable tree that I can always lean on.
d_counseling_tia_01_7,Can I be a little chameleon clinging to your side?
d_counseling_tia_01_8,Hehe!
d_counseling_tia_01_9,Wow!
d_counseling_tia_01_10,I'm shocked to hear you say that.
d_counseling_tia_01_11,You just echoed my sentiments exactly.
d_counseling_tia_01_12,I am still not sure what I want to do going forward.
d_counseling_tia_01_13,It's tough trying to determine your future...
d_counseling_tia_01_14,Tia and I both think about what we want our futures to be like.
d_counseling_tia_02_1,I ran into Belorta in the cafe.
d_counseling_tia_02_2,"She said that when it comes to food, the more the better. It doesn't matter what you're eating."
d_counseling_tia_02_3,"What do you think, Teacher?"
d_counseling_tia_02_4,I agree with her 100%.
d_counseling_tia_02_5,"It's all about quality, not quantity. The taste is what's important."
d_counseling_tia_02_6,Hm...
d_counseling_tia_02_7,"I should have expected an answer like that from a big, healthy guy like yourself."
d_counseling_tia_02_8,"As for me, I tend to focus more on the quality of what I'm eating, not the quantity."
d_counseling_tia_02_9,"Although I have to say, your answers somehow always have a way of seeming valid..."
d_counseling_tia_02_10,This is fantastic.
d_counseling_tia_02_11,We both feel the same on this. It's like we were meant to be together.
d_counseling_tia_02_12,!
d_counseling_tia_02_13,"Whoops... sorry, hehe."
d_counseling_tia_02_14,I got a little excited.
d_counseling_tia_02_15,I'll try and be better at maintaining my composure in the future.
d_counseling_tia_02_16,Tia and I continue to discuss how much is too much when eating.
d_counseling_tia_03_1,"Naga is in the same class as me,"
d_counseling_tia_03_2,but she's so much more mature.
d_counseling_tia_03_3,I think that's why I depend on her so much.
d_counseling_tia_03_4,Shouldn't you try and be more independent?
d_counseling_tia_03_5,I think I know what you mean.
d_counseling_tia_03_6,"Oof, you really exposed me..."
d_counseling_tia_03_7,I want to put off living on my own for as long as I can.
d_counseling_tia_03_8,It's lonely being all by yourself.
d_counseling_tia_03_9,Any chance I could live with you in the future?
d_counseling_tia_03_10,I'll consider being less dependent on Naga then.
d_counseling_tia_03_11,Hehe!
d_counseling_tia_03_12,"Sometimes she's like a big sister, then other times she's like my mom."
d_counseling_tia_03_13,Her determination is infectious.
d_counseling_tia_03_14,"Whenever I see her working hard on something, I feel so happy."
d_counseling_tia_03_15,Tia and I talk about Naga.
d_counseling_tia_04_1,Teacher.
d_counseling_tia_04_2,Are you busy right now?
d_counseling_tia_04_3,Yes.
d_counseling_tia_04_4,No.
d_counseling_tia_04_5,"Aww, too bad."
d_counseling_tia_04_6,I'll try next time.
d_counseling_tia_04_7,Bye bye.
d_counseling_tia_04_8,I'm joking. I'm not busy.
d_counseling_tia_04_9,Ah! I'm glad. Can you go somewhere with me for a bit?
d_counseling_tia_04_10,I'll take you somewhere nice.
d_counseling_tia_04_11,"Okay, great."
d_counseling_tia_04_12,"There's this dessert event I'm going to, and I need a plus one."
d_counseling_tia_04_13,Naga says she has something to do after school.
d_counseling_tia_04_14,Would you like to join me?
d_counseling_tia_04_15,"Sure, let's go."
d_counseling_tia_04_16,"Yahoo! Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_04_17,I participate in the dessert event with Tia.
d_counseling_tia_05_1,I haven't been too happy about my dessert photos lately.
d_counseling_tia_05_2,What do you think I'm doing wrong?
d_counseling_tia_05_3,I think it's a problem with the focus.
d_counseling_tia_05_4,I think it's a problem with the filter.
d_counseling_tia_05_5,You think? Let me see.
d_counseling_tia_05_6,*Click*
d_counseling_tia_05_7,"Huh, you're right. It does seem a bit blurry."
d_counseling_tia_05_8,Ah!
d_counseling_tia_05_9,*Wipe wipe*
d_counseling_tia_05_10,*Click*
d_counseling_tia_05_11,Much better!
d_counseling_tia_05_12,Some whipped cream had gotten smeared on the lens.
d_counseling_tia_05_13,That must be why everything was coming out blurry.
d_counseling_tia_05_14,"Thanks for the help, Teacher!"
d_counseling_tia_05_15,You mean like a colored filter?
d_counseling_tia_05_16,"I'd use a red one, but that seems a bit too fiery."
d_counseling_tia_05_17,The yellow one reminds me of oil.
d_counseling_tia_05_18,The blue one makes everything look like food from an alien planet.
d_counseling_tia_05_19,Hmmm...
d_counseling_tia_05_20,"Well, thanks for the suggestion anyway, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_05_21,I'll have to find another filter to use.
d_counseling_tia_05_22,Tia immerses herself in her photography until the photos come out to her satisfaction.
d_counseling_tia_06_1,You see the container I'm always carrying on my back?
d_counseling_tia_06_2,What animal do you think is in the pattern?
d_counseling_tia_06_3,A snake.
d_counseling_tia_06_4,A dragon.
d_counseling_tia_06_5,"Snakes are cute too,"
d_counseling_tia_06_6,but this is actually a dragon.
d_counseling_tia_06_7,It's named Epiq.
d_counseling_tia_06_8,Epiq?
d_counseling_tia_06_9,Yep! It's a nickname I came up with myself.
d_counseling_tia_06_10,I knew you'd be able to tell what it was instantly.
d_counseling_tia_06_11,Say hello to Epiq!
d_counseling_tia_06_12,Epiq?
d_counseling_tia_06_13,Yep! It's a nickname I came up with myself.
d_counseling_tia_06_14,"From now on, whenever you see Epiq, be sure to give her a warm welcome."
d_counseling_tia_06_15,Tia continues to boast about Epiq for a while.
d_counseling_tia_07_1,"Whenever I go to the cafe, I order a coffee and some desserts."
d_counseling_tia_07_2,"Although I have to admit, I usually don't end up drinking much of the coffee, 'cause it's too bitter."
d_counseling_tia_07_3,"What about you, Teacher?"
d_counseling_tia_07_4,I just drink coffee.
d_counseling_tia_07_5,I also eat a lot of desserts.
d_counseling_tia_07_6,Attractive men with a coffee scent... totally a dream of mine.
d_counseling_tia_07_7,I should invite you to come to the cafe with me.
d_counseling_tia_07_8,"You can have a cup of coffee, and I'll have some desserts."
d_counseling_tia_07_9,It'd be a match made in heaven!
d_counseling_tia_07_10,You don't say!
d_counseling_tia_07_11,I never thought I'd have a rival dessert fanatic.
d_counseling_tia_07_12,I'll have to keep an eye out for you at the cafe and make sure we don't run into each other.
d_counseling_tia_07_13,I have a conversation with Tia about the cafe.
d_counseling_tia_08_1,"Teacher, check these animal pictures."
d_counseling_tia_08_2,Isn't it adorable?
d_counseling_tia_08_3,Which one? The puppy?
d_counseling_tia_08_4,Which one? The chameleon?
d_counseling_tia_08_5,"No, not the puppy! This one!"
d_counseling_tia_08_6,"Tia's finger moves towards the chameleon, which is the furthest thing from cute."
d_counseling_tia_08_7,Isn't it lovely?
d_counseling_tia_08_8,I just love chameleons!
d_counseling_tia_08_9,Yep!
d_counseling_tia_08_10,Such vibrant colors. Such a unique appearance.
d_counseling_tia_08_11,Those round and expressive eyes.
d_counseling_tia_08_12,Chameleons are just magical!
d_counseling_tia_08_13,...
d_counseling_tia_08_14,I decide to respect Tia's preference for certain animals.
d_counseling_tia_09_1,"For some reason, my shoulders feel a bit stiff."
d_counseling_tia_09_2,Maybe I've been studying too hard?
d_counseling_tia_09_3,You've got to maintain good posture during class.
d_counseling_tia_09_4,Maybe it's because you've got such a big heart.
d_counseling_tia_09_5,Naga said the same thing.
d_counseling_tia_09_6,"I was super tired today, so I was slouching over my desk."
d_counseling_tia_09_7,I'll try to sit up straight from now on.
d_counseling_tia_09_8,"Ha! I don't know what I expected, but certainly not a compliment. You're gonna make me blush."
d_counseling_tia_09_9,"So if you've got a big heart, it can actually make your shoulders stiffen up?"
d_counseling_tia_09_10,I had no idea.
d_counseling_tia_09_11,I've got to tell Naga about this.
d_counseling_tia_09_12,I give Tia a light shoulder massage.
d_counseling_tia_10_1,A nice cake has to look good. It's even more important than the taste.
d_counseling_tia_10_2,Wouldn't you agree?
d_counseling_tia_10_3,I agree.
d_counseling_tia_10_4,I don't agree.
d_counseling_tia_10_5,I figured you would.
d_counseling_tia_10_6,"If the outside is appealing enough, then you'll want to eat it up."
d_counseling_tia_10_7,"Of course, what's even more important is that it'll come out looking good in photos."
d_counseling_tia_10_8,"I suppose most people wouldn't care too much about appearance,"
d_counseling_tia_10_9,"but still, it's too bad you feel that way."
d_counseling_tia_10_10,I thought for sure we'd agree on this.
d_counseling_tia_10_11,Tia and I spend some time talking about our food preferences.
d_counseling_tia_11_1,I saw Miss Marciana
d_counseling_tia_11_2,standing outside of the dessert store.
d_counseling_tia_11_3,What do you think she was doing there?
d_counseling_tia_11_4,She was probably there to buy some desserts.
d_counseling_tia_11_5,"Maybe she heard some students were hanging out there late at night, and she wanted to check up on them."
d_counseling_tia_11_6,"Hehe, you're a real joker, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_11_7,There's no way Miss Marciana would be caught dead buying desserts.
d_counseling_tia_11_8,"I offered her some before, and she practically had a conniption."
d_counseling_tia_11_9,She hates all things sweet with a passion.
d_counseling_tia_11_10,I think that's the most likely explanation.
d_counseling_tia_11_11,"In that case, I probably shouldn't go to the cafe when it's too late."
d_counseling_tia_11_12,"Otherwise, Miss Marciana might worry about me."
d_counseling_tia_11_13,I have a conversation with Tia about why Marciana was in front of the dessert store.
d_counseling_tia_12_1,"Hi, Teacher!"
d_counseling_tia_12_2,It's good to see you.
d_counseling_tia_12_3,Tia runs into my arms and gives me a big hug.
d_counseling_tia_12_4,Nice to see you.
d_counseling_tia_12_5,You shouldn't act like this when we're in public.
d_counseling_tia_12_6,Hehe... hehehe...
d_counseling_tia_12_7,Wheeee!
d_counseling_tia_12_8,...
d_counseling_tia_12_9,"Oh, whoops."
d_counseling_tia_12_10,"Sorry, I forgot again."
d_counseling_tia_12_11,"Oh, right."
d_counseling_tia_12_12,Sorry.
d_counseling_tia_12_13,I always forget when Naga isn't here.
d_counseling_tia_12_14,I won't do it again.
d_counseling_tia_12_15,I give Tia advice on how to be mindful of physical contact.
d_counseling_tia_13_1,"If I met a dragon on the surface,"
d_counseling_tia_13_2,what would I wish for?
d_counseling_tia_13_3,Free desserts for life.
d_counseling_tia_13_4,Dragons grant wishes?
d_counseling_tia_13_5,"Whoa, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_tia_13_6,I'm glad I asked you.
d_counseling_tia_13_7,I've gotta write this down before I forget.
d_counseling_tia_13_8,Sure they do!
d_counseling_tia_13_9,I see it in a cartoon that airs every night.
d_counseling_tia_13_10,"Aw man, just thinking about it makes my heart flutter."
d_counseling_tia_13_11,I have imaginations with Tia about making wishes to a dragon.
d_counseling_tia_14_1,It's tough managing a social media account.
d_counseling_tia_14_2,People are always wanting me to collaborate with them for all sorts of ads.
d_counseling_tia_14_3,I get lots of people asking me how much I'd be willing to sell my account for.
d_counseling_tia_14_4,Some even ask for my personal information.
d_counseling_tia_14_5,That's because you're so pretty.
d_counseling_tia_14_6,That's because you take such stunning photos of desserts.
d_counseling_tia_14_7,Huh?
d_counseling_tia_14_8,This is a travesty!
d_counseling_tia_14_9,You clearly have never visited my account.
d_counseling_tia_14_10,"It's called SWEET_Lover, and there aren't any pictures of my face on it."
d_counseling_tia_14_11,I only post photos of desserts on there. You should follow me.
d_counseling_tia_14_12,I'll take it!
d_counseling_tia_14_13,That's the best compliment you could have possibly given me.
d_counseling_tia_14_14,"I was feeling down in the dumps, but not any more, thanks to you."
d_counseling_tia_14_15,"Thanks a bunch, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_14_16,Tia and I try to come up with hacks that would make running a social media account easier.
d_counseling_tia_15_1,I wolfed down 50 desserts at the cafe yesterday.
d_counseling_tia_15_2,You should have seen the owner. They were stunned.
d_counseling_tia_15_3,That's all you ate?
d_counseling_tia_15_4,You ate that much?
d_counseling_tia_15_5,"Yeah, I had to stop before I scared the owner too much."
d_counseling_tia_15_6,"It's a real shame, because I could have eaten way more."
d_counseling_tia_15_7,How come you're so surprised?
d_counseling_tia_15_8,You of all people should know that I usually eat way more than that.
d_counseling_tia_15_9,Looks like I'll have to take you along with me on these cafe excursions.
d_counseling_tia_15_10,"Tia explains to me how there is a separate stomach for dessert, and another for regular food."
d_counseling_tia_16_1,"I'm usually not like this with other desserts,"
d_counseling_tia_16_2,"but every time I see a chocolate fountain,"
d_counseling_tia_16_3,"this incredible feeling wells up inside me, and I can't control it."
d_counseling_tia_16_4,"What kind of feeling, exactly?"
d_counseling_tia_16_5,I think I might know that feeling you're describing.
d_counseling_tia_16_6,Something like this.
d_counseling_tia_16_7,Hehe!
d_counseling_tia_16_8,*Hug*
d_counseling_tia_16_9,The feeling I get whenever I hug you nice and tight!
d_counseling_tia_16_10,Hehe!
d_counseling_tia_16_11,"Whenever I set my eyes on a chocolate fountain,"
d_counseling_tia_16_12,"I wanna run over, dunk my head straight in and guzzle down everything in it!"
d_counseling_tia_16_13,I can't help it...
d_counseling_tia_16_14,Tia and I both have to keep ourselves from drooling as we envision chocolate fountains.
d_counseling_tia_17_1,Hey Teacher.
d_counseling_tia_17_2,Do you prefer soft or hard objects?
d_counseling_tia_17_3,Hard.
d_counseling_tia_17_4,Soft.
d_counseling_tia_17_5,Me too.
d_counseling_tia_17_6,They just feel more reliable in a way.
d_counseling_tia_17_7,I'm glad you feel the same way.
d_counseling_tia_17_8,"Dragon scales must be super hard too, right?"
d_counseling_tia_17_9,I see.
d_counseling_tia_17_10,It's always nice touching something soft.
d_counseling_tia_17_11,Like whenever I hug Naga.
d_counseling_tia_17_12,Tia and I have a conversation about touch.
d_counseling_tia_18_1,"Whenever I think about how my time here at the school is coming to an end,"
d_counseling_tia_18_2,I get so sad.
d_counseling_tia_18_3,Is there any way you can delay it?
d_counseling_tia_18_4,Is it because you're worried about your future?
d_counseling_tia_18_5,"That'd be great if I could,"
d_counseling_tia_18_6,but is that even possible?
d_counseling_tia_18_7,I'm not entirely sure if it is...
d_counseling_tia_18_8,Darn.
d_counseling_tia_18_9,Too bad.
d_counseling_tia_18_10,"Heh, you got me."
d_counseling_tia_18_11,I should have known I couldn't hide it from you.
d_counseling_tia_18_12,I have no idea what I'm going to do after graduation.
d_counseling_tia_18_13,"Well, I'm sure things will work out in the end."
d_counseling_tia_18_14,I have a conversation with Tia about her happy school days.
d_counseling_tia_19_1,I'm jealous of people who get to live with a dog or cat.
d_counseling_tia_19_2,All I can do is stare at photos of the animals I want to have.
d_counseling_tia_19_3,It's so pathetic.
d_counseling_tia_19_4,Like that crocodile?
d_counseling_tia_19_5,Like that dragon?
d_counseling_tia_19_6,"That's called a dwarf caiman, to be precise."
d_counseling_tia_19_7,Isn't it the cutest thing?
d_counseling_tia_19_8,What I'd give to be able to pat its scales with my hands.
d_counseling_tia_19_9,"Don't be silly, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_19_10,How could I possibly have a dragon as a pet?
d_counseling_tia_19_11,It'd be way too big to bring into the Ark.
d_counseling_tia_19_12,I spend time with Tia talking about pets.
d_counseling_tia_20_1,Doesn't Naga look pretty with her hair tied back?
d_counseling_tia_20_2,I was thinking of tying my hair back to switch up my image. Hehe.
d_counseling_tia_20_3,You're perfect just the way you are.
d_counseling_tia_20_4,That'll make you two look like sisters. That oughta be fun.
d_counseling_tia_20_5,Hehe...
d_counseling_tia_20_6,You're gonna make me blush.
d_counseling_tia_20_7,"Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_tia_20_8,"Whoa, that'd be great!"
d_counseling_tia_20_9,Now I'm definitely gonna do it for sure.
d_counseling_tia_20_10,I watch Tia try out all kinds of different hairstyles.
d_counseling_naga_01_1,Isn't my daughter adorable?
d_counseling_naga_01_2,"It brings a smile to my face every time I look at her, hehe."
d_counseling_naga_01_3,You have a kid?
d_counseling_naga_01_4,Totally. She's adorable.
d_counseling_naga_01_5,What? Of course I don't!
d_counseling_naga_01_6,I'm still a student.
d_counseling_naga_01_7,That's just how I refer to Tia sometimes.
d_counseling_naga_01_8,Hilarious that you got the wrong idea!
d_counseling_naga_01_9,I figured you would agree.
d_counseling_naga_01_10,"Tia is always running up and giving me hugs, going on about how I feel like a mom to her."
d_counseling_naga_01_11,"You take such good care of her, that you're like a father figure as well,"
d_counseling_naga_01_12,so that's why I brought it up.
d_counseling_naga_01_13,I hope you can continue to look after her.
d_counseling_naga_01_14,Naga and I have a conversation about how cute Tia is.
d_counseling_naga_02_1,All the underclassmen were badgering me yesterday.
d_counseling_naga_02_2,They were wondering if I was in the graduating class because I looked old.
d_counseling_naga_02_3,I hate it when they tease me for looking older.
d_counseling_naga_02_4,"Maybe it's because you in fact look so young, and they're just jealous."
d_counseling_naga_02_5,That's terrible...
d_counseling_naga_02_6,"You always know what to say, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_02_7,And it's all the better because I know they're not just empty words.
d_counseling_naga_02_8,Thanks.
d_counseling_naga_02_9,"I'm sorry,"
d_counseling_naga_02_10,I didn't mean to bum you out.
d_counseling_naga_02_11,"Don't let it get you down, okay?"
d_counseling_naga_02_12,Keep your chin up.
d_counseling_naga_02_13,I tell Naga that age is just a number.
d_counseling_naga_03_1,What do you think of this new bracelet I bought?
d_counseling_naga_03_2,Did you pick it yourself? You have good taste.
d_counseling_naga_03_3,It suits you well. You look mature.
d_counseling_naga_03_4,What a wonderful compliment.
d_counseling_naga_03_5,Keep 'em coming.
d_counseling_naga_03_6,"So, in other words..."
d_counseling_naga_03_7,"I look old, is that it?"
d_counseling_naga_03_8,"Haha, gotcha! I'm just joking. You should have seen your face."
d_counseling_naga_03_9,We look at Naga's bracelet together.
d_counseling_naga_04_1,"Once in a while, I get a bit frustrated."
d_counseling_naga_04_2,"At times like that, I just want to get as far away from the school as I can."
d_counseling_naga_04_3,You're more than welcome to come hang out with me anytime you want.
d_counseling_naga_04_4,"No matter how bad you feel, you can't forget your responsibilities as a student."
d_counseling_naga_04_5,"I thought you'd say something like that,"
d_counseling_naga_04_6,but it feels nice to hear you really say it.
d_counseling_naga_04_7,I might just take you up on that offer sometime.
d_counseling_naga_04_8,"A truly professional answer if there ever was one. I expected no less from you, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_04_9,"It might not be easy, but I feel like I'm back on track."
d_counseling_naga_04_10,And it's thanks to you.
d_counseling_naga_04_11,I speak with Naga about the difficulties of attending school.
d_counseling_naga_05_1,"I was wondering why everyone around me has been so glum lately,"
d_counseling_naga_05_2,and it turns out exams are approaching.
d_counseling_naga_05_3,My stomach is always in knots during this time of the school year.
d_counseling_naga_05_4,Have you not studied properly for your exams?
d_counseling_naga_05_5,Your expression is telling me you're worried about something other than exams.
d_counseling_naga_05_6,You caught me!
d_counseling_naga_05_7,I'll take my studying more seriously from here on out.
d_counseling_naga_05_8,Don't forget to cheer me on!
d_counseling_naga_05_9,...
d_counseling_naga_05_10,"Hehe, you're pretty astute, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_05_11,I'm a bit worried that
d_counseling_naga_05_12,a bunch of my friends are gonna flunk the exam.
d_counseling_naga_05_13,"If that happens, then I won't be able to see them, and I don't want that..."
d_counseling_naga_05_14,I share some tips with Naga on how to reduce stress during exams.
d_counseling_naga_06_1,I bought another hair tie.
d_counseling_naga_06_2,"It was so darned cute, that I just couldn't pass it up."
d_counseling_naga_06_3,No wonder you have so many hair ties.
d_counseling_naga_06_4,Is it the one you've got on your wrist?
d_counseling_naga_06_5,You know it!
d_counseling_naga_06_6,"I've got a bunch in my bag,"
d_counseling_naga_06_7,and there's a veritable mountain of them piled up in my room.
d_counseling_naga_06_8,Very impressive!
d_counseling_naga_06_9,How did you realize this was the one I just bought?
d_counseling_naga_06_10,"You're very attentive, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_06_11,I check out Naga's hair tie collection.
d_counseling_naga_07_1,"Whenever I see underclassmen talking about all their dreams,"
d_counseling_naga_07_2,I'm not sure how to feel.
d_counseling_naga_07_3,"On one hand, it's endearing, but on the other, it can be kind of sad."
d_counseling_naga_07_4,Mostly endearing.
d_counseling_naga_07_5,Mostly sad.
d_counseling_naga_07_6,"I hope they never lose that side of them,"
d_counseling_naga_07_7,I really do.
d_counseling_naga_07_8,...
d_counseling_naga_07_9,I can't say that
d_counseling_naga_07_10,I expected that to be your answer.
d_counseling_naga_07_11,I'm glad that you understand where I'm coming from.
d_counseling_naga_07_12,Naga and I continue talking about the underclassmen.
d_counseling_naga_08_1,I've seen Marciana a couple of times outside of school.
d_counseling_naga_08_2,She's quite charming.
d_counseling_naga_08_3,What makes you say that?
d_counseling_naga_08_4,"She's a real charmer, that's for sure."
d_counseling_naga_08_5,I'm not sure.
d_counseling_naga_08_6,How should I put it...
d_counseling_naga_08_7,She seems... very secretive.
d_counseling_naga_08_8,Like she was hiding a lot from me.
d_counseling_naga_08_9,I see that you've already experienced that side of her.
d_counseling_naga_08_10,You seem awfully interested in her.
d_counseling_naga_08_11,I'm starting to get a little envious of her!
d_counseling_naga_08_12,Naga and I talk more about Marciana.
d_counseling_naga_09_1,I want to correct Tia's slouching.
d_counseling_naga_09_2,"Whenever she sits down at her desk, she hunches over. It looks terrible."
d_counseling_naga_09_3,Do you know any good ways to fix bad posture?
d_counseling_naga_09_4,Let's buy her a posture correction device.
d_counseling_naga_09_5,We can try to convince her to change using desserts as a reward.
d_counseling_naga_09_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_naga_09_7,I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
d_counseling_naga_09_8,I've already given her some pointers on proper posture during our breaks.
d_counseling_naga_09_9,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_naga_09_10,Tia even mentioned to me that she's a bit short on credits for desserts this month.
d_counseling_naga_09_11,"Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_09_12,"As I converse with Naga, we wonder about the parts for Tia's future waist."
d_counseling_naga_10_1,"Teacher, what do you think about lying?"
d_counseling_naga_10_2,Do you think all lies are bad?
d_counseling_naga_10_3,There's nothing wrong with a little white lie.
d_counseling_naga_10_4,I think all lies are bad.
d_counseling_naga_10_5,You think so?
d_counseling_naga_10_6,"What about you, Naga? What do you think?"
d_counseling_naga_10_7,Me?
d_counseling_naga_10_8,Hehe.
d_counseling_naga_10_9,It's a secret.
d_counseling_naga_10_10,"You're nothing if not firm, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_10_11,I better watch myself from now on.
d_counseling_naga_10_12,I'd hate to get on your bad side.
d_counseling_naga_10_13,Naga and I have a discussion about lies.
d_counseling_naga_11_1,"You've really got it rough, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_11_2,You've got to care for so many Nikkes all by yourself.
d_counseling_naga_11_3,That can't be an easy job.
d_counseling_naga_11_4,I can't complain. It's part of my job.
d_counseling_naga_11_5,It can be rough. Any chance I can have a breather?
d_counseling_naga_11_6,"Your professionalism is admirable,"
d_counseling_naga_11_7,but rest is important too.
d_counseling_naga_11_8,"You're not looking so hot, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_11_9,You've got to remember to take care of yourself while you're working.
d_counseling_naga_11_10,Of course.
d_counseling_naga_11_11,You don't look so good anyway.
d_counseling_naga_11_12,I think lying down for a bit might be a good idea.
d_counseling_naga_11_13,"Come, you can rest your head on my lap."
d_counseling_naga_11_14,I accept Naga's suggestion and take a short rest.
d_counseling_naga_12_1,"Teacher, is there any chance you"
d_counseling_naga_12_2,could teach me how to refrain from impulse buying?
d_counseling_naga_12_3,"You bought some more accessories, didn't you?"
d_counseling_naga_12_4,"You bought some more desserts, didn't you?"
d_counseling_naga_12_5,...
d_counseling_naga_12_6,But this stud was so shiny! I absolutely had to buy it.
d_counseling_naga_12_7,"Honestly, I must've been over 30 feet away and I could still see it twinkling."
d_counseling_naga_12_8,"... Yeah, avoiding jewelry shops for the time being might be a good idea."
d_counseling_naga_12_9,Huh?
d_counseling_naga_12_10,I think you've got me mixed up with Tia.
d_counseling_naga_12_11,I never buy desserts on a whim.
d_counseling_naga_12_12,Naga and I ponder about impulse buying and how to curb it.
d_counseling_naga_13_1,"When I graduate, there are two things I'll miss."
d_counseling_naga_13_2,One is not being able to see Tia every day like I do now.
d_counseling_naga_13_3,What do you think the other one is?
d_counseling_naga_13_4,Not being able to see your other friends?
d_counseling_naga_13_5,Not being able to wear your uniform?
d_counseling_naga_13_6,"Sorry, but that's not it."
d_counseling_naga_13_7,"You oughta study more, hehe."
d_counseling_naga_13_8,"You're as sharp as a tack, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_13_9,That's correct.
d_counseling_naga_13_10,"Whenever I think about not being able to wear the school uniform any longer,"
d_counseling_naga_13_11,I get bummed.
d_counseling_naga_13_12,So I'll try to enjoy it as much as possible while I still can.
d_counseling_naga_13_13,I spend time with Naga talking about graduation.
d_counseling_naga_14_1,Teacher! Teacher!
d_counseling_naga_14_2,What is it?
d_counseling_naga_14_3,I turn in the direction of Naga's shouting.
d_counseling_naga_14_4,*Poke*
d_counseling_naga_14_5,Hehe.
d_counseling_naga_14_6,Naga pokes me on the cheek with her finger.
d_counseling_naga_14_7,I can't believe I fell for that.
d_counseling_naga_14_8,What was that for?
d_counseling_naga_14_9,You should see your face!
d_counseling_naga_14_10,"Just a moment ago, I got Tia pretty good as well."
d_counseling_naga_14_11,Just a little prank.
d_counseling_naga_14_12,That you totally fell for! Hehe.
d_counseling_naga_14_13,Naga goes on to tell me about more of the latest pranks that are trending at school.
d_counseling_naga_15_1,"Among those who give off dog or cat vibes,"
d_counseling_naga_15_2,which do you prefer?
d_counseling_naga_15_3,Dog vibes.
d_counseling_naga_15_4,Cat vibes.
d_counseling_naga_15_5,So you prefer people who are more soft and cuddly?
d_counseling_naga_15_6,That's too bad.
d_counseling_naga_15_7,So you prefer people who are a bit more sassy?
d_counseling_naga_15_8,That's encouraging.
d_counseling_naga_15_9,Naga and I discuss whether other people around us resemble cats or dogs.
d_counseling_naga_16_1,I want to add another keyring to my bag.
d_counseling_naga_16_2,What kind do you think would look best?
d_counseling_naga_16_3,A purple one shaped like a ribbon.
d_counseling_naga_16_4,It doesn't look like you have room for any more keyrings.
d_counseling_naga_16_5,Right! How come I didn't think of that?
d_counseling_naga_16_6,You clearly know what you're talking about.
d_counseling_naga_16_7,Thanks for the suggestion. I'll go with this one.
d_counseling_naga_16_8,What are you talking about?
d_counseling_naga_16_9,There's plenty of space to add more.
d_counseling_naga_16_10,Hurry up and pick one.
d_counseling_naga_16_11,I help Naga attach the keyring to her bag.
d_counseling_naga_17_1,"Here, take these."
d_counseling_naga_17_2,What are they?
d_counseling_naga_17_3,Some vitamins.
d_counseling_naga_17_4,You've been pushing yourself hard lately.
d_counseling_naga_17_5,"I know it's not much, but I prepared this for you."
d_counseling_naga_17_6,Thank you.
d_counseling_naga_17_7,"Thanks, but the fact you're concerned about me is more than enough."
d_counseling_naga_17_8,I'm the one who should be thankful.
d_counseling_naga_17_9,You always take care of me.
d_counseling_naga_17_10,Take one in the morning and one at night.
d_counseling_naga_17_11,Don't forget.
d_counseling_naga_17_12,"Please, I insist."
d_counseling_naga_17_13,"If you feel I'm pressuring you, I'll take them back."
d_counseling_naga_17_14,But you better accept them next time!
d_counseling_naga_17_15,I express my gratitude to Naga.
d_counseling_naga_18_1,"Teacher, I'm here."
d_counseling_naga_18_2,*Thud*
d_counseling_naga_18_3,"Naga drops her bag, which lands on the ground with a resounding thud."
d_counseling_naga_18_4,What's that bag made of?
d_counseling_naga_18_5,What do you have in that bag?
d_counseling_naga_18_6,This bag?
d_counseling_naga_18_7,Just ordinary fabric.
d_counseling_naga_18_8,Is there a problem?
d_counseling_naga_18_9,You wanna see?
d_counseling_naga_18_10,*Ziiiip*
d_counseling_naga_18_11,These are an extra pair of stockings for Tia and a spare textbook for her...
d_counseling_naga_18_12,A backup set of gym clothes for Tia... some extra desserts for Tia...
d_counseling_naga_18_13,"This is Tia's spare tablet... oh, and then there's this..."
d_counseling_naga_18_14,I watch Naga unpack her bag for what feels like forever.
d_counseling_naga_19_1,"No matter how much I try not to think about some unpleasant memories,"
d_counseling_naga_19_2,they keep popping up.
d_counseling_naga_19_3,What would you do whenever that happens?
d_counseling_naga_19_4,I'd listen to soothing music and meditate.
d_counseling_naga_19_5,I shout at the top of my voice to release the stress.
d_counseling_naga_19_6,That's an awesome idea!
d_counseling_naga_19_7,I'll give that a try next time.
d_counseling_naga_19_8,"Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_19_9,"Hehe, that's a funny image."
d_counseling_naga_19_10,It really cheers me up.
d_counseling_naga_19_11,"Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_naga_19_12,"I comfort Naga, who seems less peppy than usual."
d_counseling_naga_20_1,"Whenever I do a group project,"
d_counseling_naga_20_2,I end up being the group leader.
d_counseling_naga_20_3,"It's not like I forced anyone, either. It's all decided fair and square through a vote."
d_counseling_naga_20_4,Why do you think that happens?
d_counseling_naga_20_5,People see you as a natural-born leader.
d_counseling_naga_20_6,Maybe they see you as a mature and sensible figure.
d_counseling_naga_20_7,Is that what the others think of me?
d_counseling_naga_20_8,I'll have to continue brushing up on my leadership skills going forward then!
d_counseling_naga_20_9,...
d_counseling_naga_20_10,"Teacher,"
d_counseling_naga_20_11,are you saying I look old?
d_counseling_naga_20_12,I have a conversation about group projects with Naga.
d_counseling_quiry_01_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_quiry_01_2,"The left one is the cup, and the one on the right is the bowl."
d_counseling_quiry_01_3,... Right?
d_counseling_quiry_01_4,Correct!
d_counseling_quiry_01_5,Wrong.
d_counseling_quiry_01_6,Yahoo!
d_counseling_quiry_01_7,"That was a blind guess, but I think I can see it now."
d_counseling_quiry_01_8,"This is the cup handle, right?"
d_counseling_quiry_01_9,It's not?
d_counseling_quiry_01_10,But how?!
d_counseling_quiry_01_11,"As Quiry gesticulates wildly, her hands veer dangerously close to the cup..."
d_counseling_quiry_01_12,*Clank*
d_counseling_quiry_01_13,Whoops!
d_counseling_quiry_01_14,We end our session while cleaning up the shards of the broken cup.
d_counseling_quiry_02_1,You know those documents you sent to me this morning?
d_counseling_quiry_02_2,One of them is missing.
d_counseling_quiry_02_3,Don't forget it next time.
d_counseling_quiry_02_4,Are you sure that's right?
d_counseling_quiry_02_5,"Will do. Good catch, Quiry."
d_counseling_quiry_02_6,I'm positive.
d_counseling_quiry_02_7,"I may not know much about a lot of things, but documentation is one thing I excel at."
d_counseling_quiry_02_8,You have no idea how hard I've trained to be good at what I do.
d_counseling_quiry_02_9,No worries.
d_counseling_quiry_02_10,I put a lot of effort into administrative work and handling documents.
d_counseling_quiry_02_11,"For example, if I put my face right up against the screen, I can see it way more clearly!"
d_counseling_quiry_02_12,I have an enjoyable time with Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_03_1,*Sigh*
d_counseling_quiry_03_2,I feel bad for making Poli's life so difficult.
d_counseling_quiry_03_3,Did you mistake her for a towel again?
d_counseling_quiry_03_4,Did something happen?
d_counseling_quiry_03_5,"No, she's gotten used to that by now."
d_counseling_quiry_03_6,...
d_counseling_quiry_03_7,I really do feel terrible.
d_counseling_quiry_03_8,"It's a bit embarrassing to admit this,"
d_counseling_quiry_03_9,"but I mistook a radio for a snack, and..."
d_counseling_quiry_03_10,...
d_counseling_quiry_03_11,"Actually, telling someone else about it makes me feel a lot better."
d_counseling_quiry_03_12,I spend time consoling Quiry during our session.
d_counseling_quiry_04_1,How does it feel to see the world clearly?
d_counseling_quiry_04_2,I can't begin to imagine what it's like. Everything is always so blurry for me.
d_counseling_quiry_04_3,"It's like looking at my face, but all the time."
d_counseling_quiry_04_4,It's like a haze being cleared away.
d_counseling_quiry_04_5,Whoa...
d_counseling_quiry_04_6,I totally get it!
d_counseling_quiry_04_7,"But I think if everything were always that clear, it'd hurt my eyes."
d_counseling_quiry_04_8,Hmmm...
d_counseling_quiry_04_9,I can't really imagine it.
d_counseling_quiry_04_10,"Even if the haze clears away, I think it'd still be kinda blurry."
d_counseling_quiry_04_11,Quiry and I have a conversation about seeing clearly.
d_counseling_quiry_05_1,*Crash*
d_counseling_quiry_05_2,Yikes!
d_counseling_quiry_05_3,"Sorry, Commander, I didn't see the door..."
d_counseling_quiry_05_4,"It's okay, I planned on swapping it out for a new one anyway."
d_counseling_quiry_05_5,"You're not hurt, are you?"
d_counseling_quiry_05_6,You're lying.
d_counseling_quiry_05_7,I'm really sorry...
d_counseling_quiry_05_8,"Awww, you're so kind. I'm okay."
d_counseling_quiry_05_9,I can't say the same thing about the door though...
d_counseling_quiry_05_10,I'll pay for everything. Please don't tell Poli!
d_counseling_quiry_05_11,I spend time with Quiry mourning about the broken door.
d_counseling_quiry_06_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_quiry_06_2,"this is a super big secret,"
d_counseling_quiry_06_3,but Poli recently...
d_counseling_quiry_06_4,was eating something she shouldn't have been. It was brown if you catch my drift...
d_counseling_quiry_06_5,"Actually, I enjoy eating that myself."
d_counseling_quiry_06_6,It's not what you think. It's just Splendamin in sweet potato flavor.
d_counseling_quiry_06_7,?!
d_counseling_quiry_06_8,What?!
d_counseling_quiry_06_9,Has everyone lost their minds?
d_counseling_quiry_06_10,Oh!
d_counseling_quiry_06_11,Phew...
d_counseling_quiry_06_12,I need to apologize to Poli. I had the completely wrong idea...
d_counseling_quiry_06_13,I have a conversation with Quiry about Splendamin in sweet potato flavor.
d_counseling_quiry_07_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_quiry_07_2,"There are times where I feel my bad eyesight is actually a blessing,"
d_counseling_quiry_07_3,especially since my line of work is being a police officer.
d_counseling_quiry_07_4,Because you can't see certain things you'd rather not see anyway?
d_counseling_quiry_07_5,Really?
d_counseling_quiry_07_6,Exactly!
d_counseling_quiry_07_7,There are some things that throw even Poli and Miranda for a loop.
d_counseling_quiry_07_8,"I feel bad when they have to cover up for my deficiencies,"
d_counseling_quiry_07_9,but I still feel glad that I can't see certain things.
d_counseling_quiry_07_10,"... It's a bit selfish of me, isn't it?"
d_counseling_quiry_07_11,Yep.
d_counseling_quiry_07_12,There are moments where I'd rather not see certain things.
d_counseling_quiry_07_13,"In those moments, I feel like I'm using my eyesight as a crutch though."
d_counseling_quiry_07_14,Quiry and I have a serious conversation.
d_counseling_quiry_08_1,"Poli says that during work, I should try to stay away from Miranda as much as possible."
d_counseling_quiry_08_2,"I know that we both get into a lot of accidents, but still..."
d_counseling_quiry_08_3,"I think we complement each other, don't you?"
d_counseling_quiry_08_4,No way. You'd only end up with accidents twice as big.
d_counseling_quiry_08_5,Definitely. You two could help each other out.
d_counseling_quiry_08_6,A bit harsh...
d_counseling_quiry_08_7,But thank you anyway for the constructive criticism.
d_counseling_quiry_08_8,"Poli said the same thing, probably because she was worried."
d_counseling_quiry_08_9,Exactly!
d_counseling_quiry_08_10,...
d_counseling_quiry_08_11,But I'm sure Poli had a good reason for telling us to stay apart.
d_counseling_quiry_08_12,I should try to keep away from Miranda as much as possible.
d_counseling_quiry_08_13,I spend a meaningful time with Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_09_1,Agh!
d_counseling_quiry_09_2,Commander! There's a bug on the desk!
d_counseling_quiry_09_3,I'll catch it for you.
d_counseling_quiry_09_4,Eeek! A bug!
d_counseling_quiry_09_5,*Crash*
d_counseling_quiry_09_6,Whoa! Did you just catch a bug with your bare hands?
d_counseling_quiry_09_7,Cool!
d_counseling_quiry_09_8,*Gulp*
d_counseling_quiry_09_9,...?
d_counseling_quiry_09_10,Did you... just eat it?
d_counseling_quiry_09_11,I see you're brave in more ways than one...
d_counseling_quiry_09_12,... I-I'll catch it.
d_counseling_quiry_09_13,Stay still!
d_counseling_quiry_09_14,Oh jeez...
d_counseling_quiry_09_15,*Crash*
d_counseling_quiry_09_16,"What Quiry took for a bug, was in fact, a cookie."
d_counseling_quiry_10_1,"This just came to me,"
d_counseling_quiry_10_2,but why am I able to see you so clearly?
d_counseling_quiry_10_3,This has never happened with anyone else.
d_counseling_quiry_10_4,Could it be because of my rank?
d_counseling_quiry_10_5,Because I'm special.
d_counseling_quiry_10_6,Hmmm...
d_counseling_quiry_10_7,Other commanders still look blurry to me.
d_counseling_quiry_10_8,There must be another reason.
d_counseling_quiry_10_9,Special...
d_counseling_quiry_10_10,That is true...
d_counseling_quiry_10_11,"Hehe. I'm not sure if I can see you clearly because you're special, or if you're special because I can see you clearly."
d_counseling_quiry_10_12,Quiry and I have a fun counseling session.
d_counseling_quiry_11_1,I want to be a capable police officer like Poli.
d_counseling_quiry_11_2,Someone who recognizes danger at a moment's notice and saves people.
d_counseling_quiry_11_3,"A calm, cool, and collected officer of the law who can handle any situation."
d_counseling_quiry_11_4,"You can do it, I'm sure of it!"
d_counseling_quiry_11_5,... Do you really think that's possible?
d_counseling_quiry_11_6,You really think so?
d_counseling_quiry_11_7,I'll never give up!
d_counseling_quiry_11_8,It's just that a lot of people will have to put up with me during the process...
d_counseling_quiry_11_9,I-it won't be easy but...
d_counseling_quiry_11_10,I don't want to give up.
d_counseling_quiry_11_11,...
d_counseling_quiry_11_12,Do you think I don't have it in me?
d_counseling_quiry_11_13,I try to encourage the dejected Quiry before ending the session.
d_counseling_quiry_12_1,I wish I had a hobby.
d_counseling_quiry_12_2,My vision is so terrible that even that's hard.
d_counseling_quiry_12_3,Do you know of any new pastimes I can get into?
d_counseling_quiry_12_4,Swimming.
d_counseling_quiry_12_5,Listening to music.
d_counseling_quiry_12_6,"Oh, good idea!"
d_counseling_quiry_12_7,It's not like you can see far ahead of you when you're underwater anyway.
d_counseling_quiry_12_8,...
d_counseling_quiry_12_9,But I can't swim.
d_counseling_quiry_12_10,"Oh, good idea!"
d_counseling_quiry_12_11,You don't need good eyesight to listen to music.
d_counseling_quiry_12_12,Can you recommend some songs that I should listen to?
d_counseling_quiry_12_13,I have a fun counseling session with Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_13_1,Oh boy.
d_counseling_quiry_13_2,"I followed someone thinking it was Miranda, but it was a stranger."
d_counseling_quiry_13_3,I thought for sure that I saw brown pigtails.
d_counseling_quiry_13_4,Is there any other way I can better pinpoint that it's Miranda?
d_counseling_quiry_13_5,Look carefully at how she walks.
d_counseling_quiry_13_6,Call out her name first.
d_counseling_quiry_13_7,How she walks?
d_counseling_quiry_13_8,"Hmm, she definitely does have a distinctive bounce in her step."
d_counseling_quiry_13_9,"Still, I don't know if that'll work."
d_counseling_quiry_13_10,"Oh, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_quiry_13_11,"If it really is Miranda, she'll either respond or come closer to me."
d_counseling_quiry_13_12,"Thanks for the tip, Commander!"
d_counseling_quiry_13_13,I have a discussion with Quiry about how to tell Miranda apart from others.
d_counseling_quiry_14_1,"Commander, do I have a sullen face?"
d_counseling_quiry_14_2,People keep asking me if I'm irritated.
d_counseling_quiry_14_3,I think it's because you're always frowning.
d_counseling_quiry_14_4,Your expression looks normal to me.
d_counseling_quiry_14_5,I do?
d_counseling_quiry_14_6,I guess it's because I'm always scrunching up my face since I can't see well.
d_counseling_quiry_14_7,I'll try and smile a bit more.
d_counseling_quiry_14_8,"Thanks for letting me know, Commander!"
d_counseling_quiry_14_9,Really?
d_counseling_quiry_14_10,Then how come everyone keeps telling me that I look so upset?
d_counseling_quiry_14_11,Is my expression that bad...?
d_counseling_quiry_14_12,I have a fun time advising Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_15_1,...
d_counseling_quiry_15_2,"Despite standing upright, Quiry keeps nodding off."
d_counseling_quiry_15_3,Wake her up.
d_counseling_quiry_15_4,Don't wake her up.
d_counseling_quiry_15_5,Agh...!
d_counseling_quiry_15_6,Sorry...
d_counseling_quiry_15_7,"I had a ton of work to do last night, so I didn't get any sleep."
d_counseling_quiry_15_8,"That's no excuse for me to check out during our session, though!"
d_counseling_quiry_15_9,...
d_counseling_quiry_15_10,... Ah!
d_counseling_quiry_15_11,*Crash*
d_counseling_quiry_15_12,"Ow, my head..."
d_counseling_quiry_15_13,I have a fun time advising Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_16_1,I had a lot of worries when I first came to the Outpost.
d_counseling_quiry_16_2,"Now though, I realize this place is far more peaceful than I thought it'd be."
d_counseling_quiry_16_3,"In fact, it feels like there isn't much that I need to do."
d_counseling_quiry_16_4,That's because the A.C.P.U. upholds the law.
d_counseling_quiry_16_5,So you should take a well-deserved break.
d_counseling_quiry_16_6,...!
d_counseling_quiry_16_7,Thank you for saying that.
d_counseling_quiry_16_8,"I was always proud to be part of the A.C.P.U., but now I'm super proud!"
d_counseling_quiry_16_9,"No, I can't do that."
d_counseling_quiry_16_10,"If something were to happen while I was on vacation, I'd never forgive myself."
d_counseling_quiry_16_11,I have a constructive time with Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_17_1,"I took a day off today,"
d_counseling_quiry_17_2,but I'm not exactly sure what to do with myself.
d_counseling_quiry_17_3,Why don't you take a nap?
d_counseling_quiry_17_4,Treat yourself to a nice meal.
d_counseling_quiry_17_5,Hmmm...
d_counseling_quiry_17_6,It'd be a waste to sleep the day away.
d_counseling_quiry_17_7,Isn't there something else I can do?
d_counseling_quiry_17_8,"Oooh, I like the sound of that!"
d_counseling_quiry_17_9,But it won't be easy with me being blind as a bat.
d_counseling_quiry_17_10,"Are you busy, Commander?"
d_counseling_quiry_17_11,Quiry and I plan how we'll spend her day off together.
d_counseling_quiry_18_1,Poli?
d_counseling_quiry_18_2,What are you doing here?
d_counseling_quiry_18_3,Are we having a joint counseling session today?
d_counseling_quiry_18_4,That's just a doll.
d_counseling_quiry_18_5,That's right.
d_counseling_quiry_18_6,Ah!
d_counseling_quiry_18_7,So it wasn't Poli?
d_counseling_quiry_18_8,"Oh right, Poli said she'd be going to the Ark on business today."
d_counseling_quiry_18_9,Okay!
d_counseling_quiry_18_10,Wait a minute...
d_counseling_quiry_18_11,Poli said she'd be going to the Ark on business today.
d_counseling_quiry_18_12,"You're not teasing me, are you, Commander?"
d_counseling_quiry_18_13,I have a fun session with Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_19_1,"I'm not really sure about this, so I wanted to ask you:"
d_counseling_quiry_19_2,Am I a bit stronger than other people?
d_counseling_quiry_19_3,You're certainly good at breaking things.
d_counseling_quiry_19_4,"Yes, I think so."
d_counseling_quiry_19_5,That...
d_counseling_quiry_19_6,that is true.
d_counseling_quiry_19_7,But that wasn't exactly what I meant...
d_counseling_quiry_19_8,I knew it!
d_counseling_quiry_19_9,It feels good to find a new positive trait about yourself.
d_counseling_quiry_19_10,"With this strength, I'll be able to help more people."
d_counseling_quiry_19_11,I have a fun time advising Quiry.
d_counseling_quiry_20_1,Commander! I finally did it!
d_counseling_quiry_20_2,I'm nearly done memorizing all the roadways in the Outpost.
d_counseling_quiry_20_3,Now I won't get lost or break down any more doors.
d_counseling_quiry_20_4,Congrats!
d_counseling_quiry_20_5,"Did you say ""nearly done""?"
d_counseling_quiry_20_6,Thank you!
d_counseling_quiry_20_7,I couldn't have done it without everyone's help.
d_counseling_quiry_20_8,"Especially you, Commander. Thank you so much."
d_counseling_quiry_20_9,I'll keep at it and make sure I memorize every last path there is!
d_counseling_quiry_20_10,"Yeah, almost..."
d_counseling_quiry_20_11,"I've improved tremendously compared to last time, but I'm still bumping into things."
d_counseling_quiry_20_12,I know I've got to keep at it.
d_counseling_quiry_20_13,I have a meaningful time with Quiry.
d_counseling_tove_01_1,"The great survivors of the olden days,"
d_counseling_tove_01_2,they always had a cameraman following them around.
d_counseling_tove_01_3,"They would be chased by the bears together, run from avalanches together,"
d_counseling_tove_01_4,"eat roasted cockroaches together, jump off cliffs together..."
d_counseling_tove_01_5,When will I ever be able to find a cameraman like that?
d_counseling_tove_01_6,How about you do it yourself?
d_counseling_tove_01_7,I can do it when I retire.
d_counseling_tove_01_8,"Well, there are some pretty high-end selfie sticks these days."
d_counseling_tove_01_9,"... No, that wouldn't be right."
d_counseling_tove_01_10,You can't experience the passionate bonds that are formed from facing extreme conditions together by yourself!
d_counseling_tove_01_11,Come on. That's too far in the future. Can't you just do it now?
d_counseling_tove_01_12,It's fine if you just think of it as part-time...
d_counseling_tove_01_13,"Sorry, I'm just really focused on survival right now."
d_counseling_tove_01_14,Hmph.
d_counseling_tove_01_15,I discuss extreme careers in the olden days with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_02_1,"You've been going through a rough patch, haven't you?"
d_counseling_tove_02_2,That's why I brought you some nourishment.
d_counseling_tove_02_3,Tove takes two bags out of her pocket.
d_counseling_tove_02_4,"I'll eat one and give one to you. Now, pick one!"
d_counseling_tove_02_5,Pick the bag that is wriggling.
d_counseling_tove_02_6,Pick the bag that is tinged with a faint touch of red.
d_counseling_tove_02_7,"Oh, you chose a high-protein diet!"
d_counseling_tove_02_8,These are beetles. They are a species that only lives in the north.
d_counseling_tove_02_9,The texture is very nice. Hehe. But putting it in your mouth is the hardest part.
d_counseling_tove_02_10,Haha. You chose the liver of an Elk!
d_counseling_tove_02_11,It's not only high in protein but also rich in iron and vitamins.
d_counseling_tove_02_12,"If you can endure the bitterness, it is a great nourishing meal."
d_counseling_tove_02_13,... But why are you making that face?
d_counseling_tove_02_14,It's nothing. Haha.
d_counseling_tove_02_15,I just get so excited that I get to keep the other one.
d_counseling_tove_02_16,I have an enjoyable and bizarre mealtime with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_03_1,I've been focusing on inventing a new survival tool recently.
d_counseling_tove_03_2,If it's possible I'm hoping it would help make up for my squadmates' weak points.
d_counseling_tove_03_3,Do you have any good ideas?
d_counseling_tove_03_4,A pillow that guarantees a good night's sleep anywhere.
d_counseling_tove_03_5,A magical shield that prevents any machine malfunctions.
d_counseling_tove_03_6,For Neve?
d_counseling_tove_03_7,"This pillow can use leather to make, with soft moss or leaves to fill,"
d_counseling_tove_03_8,and it would be good to make it resemble you as closely as possible.
d_counseling_tove_03_9,"To do that, I'll need you to accompany me as a reference! Hehe."
d_counseling_tove_03_10,Something like gloves that could prevent electronic devices from being destroyed? Ludmilla would probably like that.
d_counseling_tove_03_11,But I don't think it exists in reality.
d_counseling_tove_03_12,... Should I look into myths?
d_counseling_tove_03_13,I have a conversation with Tove about methods to make unconventional tools.
d_counseling_tove_04_1,"Earlier, Ludmilla invited me to have tea."
d_counseling_tove_04_2,She asked me to bring tea leaves of my choice.
d_counseling_tove_04_3,"So I gathered some, which do you think I should take?"
d_counseling_tove_04_4,Some unknown plant roots.
d_counseling_tove_04_5,A branch of pine needles.
d_counseling_tove_04_6,"This one, right?"
d_counseling_tove_04_7,They are dandelion roots so I can say it's a flower tea. Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_04_8,"Well, pine needle tea is said to boost your immune system."
d_counseling_tove_04_9,"Then, I'll just pluck some needles from the branch..."
d_counseling_tove_04_10,*Plop*
d_counseling_tove_04_11,A caterpillar drops from the branch.
d_counseling_tove_04_12,Eeeek!
d_counseling_tove_04_13,T-today must be my lucky day! A high-protein meal just fell from the sky!
d_counseling_tove_04_14,Didn't you just say eeeek?
d_counseling_tove_04_15,I prepare for an exciting tea time with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_05_1,"One time, there was a sudden gust of wind during one of my missions,"
d_counseling_tove_05_2,so I went to a nearby ice cave to take shelter.
d_counseling_tove_05_3,"But, someone was already inside!"
d_counseling_tove_05_4,Don't tell me it was... Neve?
d_counseling_tove_05_5,Don't tell me it was... a bear?
d_counseling_tove_05_6,... Uh?
d_counseling_tove_05_7,"Oh, if it was then I wouldn't be here right now."
d_counseling_tove_05_8,Neve is usually friendly but if you bother her when she's sleeping...
d_counseling_tove_05_9,She'd probably tear you to shreds.
d_counseling_tove_05_10,Right.
d_counseling_tove_05_11,So I gently walked backwards while avoiding eye contact.
d_counseling_tove_05_12,*Sigh* I still get goosebumps thinking about it.
d_counseling_tove_05_13,Tove and I share our experiences of encountering wild animals during our missions.
d_counseling_tove_06_1,You know how Ludmilla
d_counseling_tove_06_2,breaks all machines she touches?
d_counseling_tove_06_3,Don't you think we can use that against the Raptures?
d_counseling_tove_06_4,Why didn't we think of that before?
d_counseling_tove_06_5,It's hard to get that close to them.
d_counseling_tove_06_6,You think so?
d_counseling_tove_06_7,I'll go tell Ludmilla right now.
d_counseling_tove_06_8,... That's true.
d_counseling_tove_06_9,It's impossible to get that close to a Rapture.
d_counseling_tove_06_10,I just mentioned it because I thought it would be amazing if it was possible.
d_counseling_tove_06_11,Tove and I let our imaginations run wild about Ludmilla's constitution.
d_counseling_tove_07_1,I admire some survivalists from the olden days.
d_counseling_tove_07_2,What would you think if I tried making survival videos like them?
d_counseling_tove_07_3,Are you confident you could perform eating bizarre foods in your videos?
d_counseling_tove_07_4,I don't think there are any shows with a similar concept so I think it would work well.
d_counseling_tove_07_5,Come on. I'm a survival expert. You think I'm not capable of that?
d_counseling_tove_07_6,...
d_counseling_tove_07_7,"Well, if it comes down to it, I can hold the camera and you can perform."
d_counseling_tove_07_8,Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_07_9,"After all, there is no such thing as nature in the Ark!"
d_counseling_tove_07_10,I should plan it out when I have some time.
d_counseling_tove_07_11,Tove and I watch extreme survival videos from the olden days.
d_counseling_tove_08_1,"I always study survival tactics really hard,"
d_counseling_tove_08_2,"but when I actually find myself in a survival situation, it doesn't go as smoothly as I imagined."
d_counseling_tove_08_3,You can just rely on me as you always have.
d_counseling_tove_08_4,You just need to keep practicing.
d_counseling_tove_08_5,Huh? I don't think I relied on you that much.
d_counseling_tove_08_6,Of course there was that time I sought your help when I couldn't use the flint to start the fire or when a centipede popped out of nowhere!
d_counseling_tove_08_7,But those were unexpected situations!
d_counseling_tove_08_8,"Hmm... Still, they had to do with survival."
d_counseling_tove_08_9,"If you make even a single mistake, there might not be another chance."
d_counseling_tove_08_10,But hearing you say that makes me feel at ease. Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_08_11,I have a conversation with Tove about the limits of studying survival only from books.
d_counseling_tove_09_1,There is something I've been curious about for a while.
d_counseling_tove_09_2,How are you so good at eating unusual foods?
d_counseling_tove_09_3,I learned from the master of the wild.
d_counseling_tove_09_4,It's just lunch to me.
d_counseling_tove_09_5,What? You mean there's another survival expert in this day and age?
d_counseling_tove_09_6,Tove subtly grabs onto my sleeve.
d_counseling_tove_09_7,Um... Perhaps can you put in a good word for me? Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_09_8,...!
d_counseling_tove_09_9,"By that you mean you're born with it, right?"
d_counseling_tove_09_10,Darn! This unfair world!
d_counseling_tove_09_11,I have a conversation with Tove about the various edible insects.
d_counseling_tove_10_1,I hugged Alice tightly yesterday.
d_counseling_tove_10_2,Her body is warm which is an advantage for surviving in the cold.
d_counseling_tove_10_3,Is there any way I can become more like Alice?
d_counseling_tove_10_4,Try acting like a bunny.
d_counseling_tove_10_5,You are fine just the way you are.
d_counseling_tove_10_6,!!
d_counseling_tove_10_7,"Tove makes a V sign with both hands and puts it on her head,"
d_counseling_tove_10_8,"and with both feet together, starts hopping."
d_counseling_tove_10_9,Like this?
d_counseling_tove_10_10,"... Sorry, just kidding."
d_counseling_tove_10_11,"Well... Even though I don't have a warm body like Alice,"
d_counseling_tove_10_12,I have the skills to make survival tools that can function like that.
d_counseling_tove_10_13,Thank you for recognition. Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_10_14,I hear 10 adorable moments of Alice from Tove.
d_counseling_tove_11_1,"This just came to mind,"
d_counseling_tove_11_2,but what do you think I would be doing if I wasn't a survival expert?
d_counseling_tove_11_3,A new generation rookie employee.
d_counseling_tove_11_4,Firefighter.
d_counseling_tove_11_5,Ah! I've seen that a lot on Tetra TV recently.
d_counseling_tove_11_6,"You mean someone who wears noise-cancelling earphones while they work,"
d_counseling_tove_11_7,and takes care of plants during work hours?
d_counseling_tove_11_8,"Wow, I'm shocked. I didn't know I gave off that kind of impression."
d_counseling_tove_11_9,Huh? But...
d_counseling_tove_11_10,I prefer making fires to putting them out.
d_counseling_tove_11_11,"Still, there is a connection since it's saving people's lives, hehe."
d_counseling_tove_11_12,I have a conversation with Tove about different occupations in another life.
d_counseling_tove_12_1,"Between a black mamba and I,"
d_counseling_tove_12_2,"if the two of us fought, who do you think would win?"
d_counseling_tove_12_3,"You, of course."
d_counseling_tove_12_4,Black Mamba.
d_counseling_tove_12_5,"Ooh, you trust me that much? So much pressure..."
d_counseling_tove_12_6,Did you know? A black mamba's venom is 70 times stronger than that of a rattlesnake.
d_counseling_tove_12_7,And its top speed for short distances is 20km per hour.
d_counseling_tove_12_8,"... But it doesn't mean that I'm not confident, hehe."
d_counseling_tove_12_9,"Wow, you're not holding back."
d_counseling_tove_12_10,Of course it's better to run rather than face a dangerous venomous snake like a Black Mamba.
d_counseling_tove_12_11,But still... my pride as a survival expert is...
d_counseling_tove_12_12,I learn about the venomous snakes to avoid in the wild.
d_counseling_tove_13_1,"Survivalist, do you have a goal in life?"
d_counseling_tove_13_2,My goal is all about survival. About continuing to live as long as I can.
d_counseling_tove_13_3,Of course it's reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_tove_13_4,Survival is also my goal.
d_counseling_tove_13_5,Wow... Of course yours is on a whole different scale compared to mine.
d_counseling_tove_13_6,"If you achieve your goal, it might make it easier for me to achieve mine. Hehe."
d_counseling_tove_13_7,...!!
d_counseling_tove_13_8,I can help you achieve it right now.
d_counseling_tove_13_9,"If we go a little further from the Northern Base, you can experience survival there. Hehe."
d_counseling_tove_13_10,Tove and I compile a bucket list of 30 things in life.
d_counseling_tove_14_1,The Unlimited is a squad that rescues people who are lost.
d_counseling_tove_14_2,...
d_counseling_tove_14_3,But sometimes we can't save everyone.
d_counseling_tove_14_4,I know it can't be helped but it still lingers in my heart... What should I do?
d_counseling_tove_14_5,There is nothing that time can't resolve.
d_counseling_tove_14_6,"Instead of those you couldn't rescue, you should think about the ones you did."
d_counseling_tove_14_7,"Hmm... I know you're right,"
d_counseling_tove_14_8,but it's still so hard right now.
d_counseling_tove_14_9,I wish I had something to look forward to.
d_counseling_tove_14_10,You're right.
d_counseling_tove_14_11,"Everything has both a bright and a dark side,"
d_counseling_tove_14_12,and I decide which one to focus on! Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_14_13,I have a serious conversation with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_15_1,I heard that it has extreme conditions
d_counseling_tove_15_2,in the Outer Rim.
d_counseling_tove_15_3,Is there any special method of survival?
d_counseling_tove_15_4,To fight and steal?
d_counseling_tove_15_5,It's about utilizing the resources that you have. No matter how scarce they are.
d_counseling_tove_15_6,Applying that to my situation would mean
d_counseling_tove_15_7,fighting against my squadmates for survival.
d_counseling_tove_15_8,Yikes... I'd rather jump into freezing water without any gear on!
d_counseling_tove_15_9,Basically it's not that different from the survival knowledge that I know.
d_counseling_tove_15_10,We might have more in common with the people there than I thought.
d_counseling_tove_15_11,I have a conversation about Outer Rim with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_16_1,"Hey, Survivalist, can I ask you something?"
d_counseling_tove_16_2,What does it feel like to like someone?
d_counseling_tove_16_3,Why are you suddenly interested in that?
d_counseling_tove_16_4,Like feeling you could survive any extreme situation with that person.
d_counseling_tove_16_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_tove_16_6,"To tell you the truth, the algorithm led me here. Haha."
d_counseling_tove_16_7,"While I was looking for survival videos, a video about that automatically popped up."
d_counseling_tove_16_8,So what's the answer?
d_counseling_tove_16_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_tove_16_10,"Of course, physically I rely on my squadmates,"
d_counseling_tove_16_11,but mentally you're the one I rely on the most.
d_counseling_tove_16_12,Then does that mean I like you? Huhhh?
d_counseling_tove_16_13,I have a heart-beating conversation with Tove.
d_counseling_tove_17_1,I wonder what the Unlimited members were like when they first started.
d_counseling_tove_17_2,Somehow I get the feeling that they were amazing even then.
d_counseling_tove_17_3,They might have even been a super rookie like me? Hehe.
d_counseling_tove_17_4,"To be honest, it's hard to imagine."
d_counseling_tove_17_5,They might have been more sloppy than you think.
d_counseling_tove_17_6,"To be honest, me too."
d_counseling_tove_17_7,Especially Ludmilla... I thought she was perfect from the beginning.
d_counseling_tove_17_8,Hmm... You're right.
d_counseling_tove_17_9,"Even now, they still show a human side."
d_counseling_tove_17_10,"For me, that side is more approachable and likable. Hehe."
d_counseling_tove_17_11,I learn about how Tove has adapted to The Unlimited squad.
d_counseling_tove_18_1,"It seems that when you are in the Northern Base,"
d_counseling_tove_18_2,you only accumulate experience surviving in the bitter cold.
d_counseling_tove_18_3,Sometimes I would like to experience a new environment.
d_counseling_tove_18_4,Then you can come to the Ark sometime.
d_counseling_tove_18_5,What about going to the desert?
d_counseling_tove_18_6,Uh? But there is no such thing as nature in the Ark.
d_counseling_tove_18_7,"Instead, there is still a jungle but in a different sense."
d_counseling_tove_18_8,Ah... Do you mean the jungle of society?
d_counseling_tove_18_9,"If it's not a real jungle, I don't think I'd have anything to do there."
d_counseling_tove_18_10,Wow! A desert!
d_counseling_tove_18_11,"I know everything about avoiding the sun, staying hydrated,"
d_counseling_tove_18_12,and even distinguishing edible spiders in the desert.
d_counseling_tove_18_13,I never tried surviving in an environment like that. Do you want to go there with me in the future?
d_counseling_tove_18_14,I have a conversation with Tove about surviving in various regions.
d_counseling_tove_19_1,What genre of music do you like?
d_counseling_tove_19_2,The sound of nature.
d_counseling_tove_19_3,Noise.
d_counseling_tove_19_4,"Hehe, same here."
d_counseling_tove_19_5,"Especially when I've created a warm shelter and snuggled inside,"
d_counseling_tove_19_6,I like the sound of rain.
d_counseling_tove_19_7,Huh? That is not a genre.
d_counseling_tove_19_8,It's the name of a famous singer in the Ark!
d_counseling_tove_19_9,Sometimes a singer can create their own genre.
d_counseling_tove_19_10,Tove and I listen to the music that we like.
d_counseling_tove_20_1,"Splendamin or bizarre survival food,"
d_counseling_tove_20_2,which one do you think is better suited as a punishment in a game?
d_counseling_tove_20_3,Bizarre survival food.
d_counseling_tove_20_4,Splendamin.
d_counseling_tove_20_5,Hmm... you're right.
d_counseling_tove_20_6,Survival food includes things like spiders and animal eyeballs which usually people avoid.
d_counseling_tove_20_7,"However, if you look closer, you can also find a lot of really delicious foods too."
d_counseling_tove_20_8,I second that.
d_counseling_tove_20_9,Do you know that I can't eat any more Splendamin even though it's not been so long since I came to the surface?
d_counseling_tove_20_10,"Of course I eat it when I have to, but there is a huge difference in freshness."
d_counseling_tove_20_11,"Anyways, I'll take your opinions into account."
d_counseling_tove_20_12,What?
d_counseling_tove_20_13,I play a punishment game with Tove.
d_counseling_redhood_01_1,"There you are, Handsome."
d_counseling_redhood_01_2,"Now that you're here, let's kick out the jams."
d_counseling_redhood_01_3,Red Hood presses play on her cassette player.
d_counseling_redhood_01_4,Da dada♪
d_counseling_redhood_01_5,Aren't you sick of this song by now?
d_counseling_redhood_01_6,Hum along to the song with Red Hood.
d_counseling_redhood_01_7,This isn't just some ordinary song.
d_counseling_redhood_01_8,This is a record of my life.
d_counseling_redhood_01_9,Listen to it carefully.
d_counseling_redhood_01_10,"Wow, you've memorized the melody that quickly?"
d_counseling_redhood_01_11,You just made my day.
d_counseling_redhood_01_12,"Oooh, my favorite part is coming up!"
d_counseling_redhood_01_13,La de da♪
d_counseling_redhood_01_14,Red Hood and I listen intently to the music together.
d_counseling_redhood_02_1,Which do you think is more important:
d_counseling_redhood_02_2,the past or the future?
d_counseling_redhood_02_3,The past.
d_counseling_redhood_02_4,The future.
d_counseling_redhood_02_5,It makes sense that you'd pick that.
d_counseling_redhood_02_6,"That's fine, so long as you don't allow it to constrain you in the present."
d_counseling_redhood_02_7,"After all, the past should remain in the past."
d_counseling_redhood_02_8,"Ah, you truly are a wonderful specimen,"
d_counseling_redhood_02_9,both physically and mentally.
d_counseling_redhood_02_10,"I hope you can always boldly go forth with your head held high, looking towards the future."
d_counseling_redhood_02_11,Discussed the past and future with Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_03_1,You know what?
d_counseling_redhood_03_2,I kinda miss...
d_counseling_redhood_03_3,Me?
d_counseling_redhood_03_4,Your friends from before?
d_counseling_redhood_03_5,Pssh.
d_counseling_redhood_03_6,You're nothing if not confident.
d_counseling_redhood_03_7,It's no wonder why Rapi had such feelings for you.
d_counseling_redhood_03_8,Ha ha.
d_counseling_redhood_03_9,...
d_counseling_redhood_03_10,Come on.
d_counseling_redhood_03_11,Try and have a little tact.
d_counseling_redhood_03_12,"In situations like this, you should feign ignorance."
d_counseling_redhood_03_13,Discussed some easier topics with Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_04_1,I'm bored out of my gourd.
d_counseling_redhood_04_2,Waddya say you and I get frisky?
d_counseling_redhood_04_3,"Er, isn't that a bit..."
d_counseling_redhood_04_4,I'm down.
d_counseling_redhood_04_5,I'm only joking.
d_counseling_redhood_04_6,You remind me of a friend I had a long time ago.
d_counseling_redhood_04_7,"Man, the fun I had teasing her..."
d_counseling_redhood_04_8,... I wonder how she's doing right about now?
d_counseling_redhood_04_9,I'm only joking.
d_counseling_redhood_04_10,"If I laid a finger on you, Rapi would never let me hear the end of it."
d_counseling_redhood_04_11,"I may be many things, but disloyal is not one of them."
d_counseling_redhood_04_12,Red Hood and I have a pleasant chat.
d_counseling_redhood_05_1,"Hey, Handsome."
d_counseling_redhood_05_2,What do you think is the most important quality of a good Commander?
d_counseling_redhood_05_3,"Leadership, naturally."
d_counseling_redhood_05_4,"A sense of humor, I guess?"
d_counseling_redhood_05_5,"A textbook answer, but nothing more than that."
d_counseling_redhood_05_6,My former boss would have never given such a dry answer.
d_counseling_redhood_05_7,Ha! That's a new one.
d_counseling_redhood_05_8,"If my former boss was still alive,"
d_counseling_redhood_05_9,you and he would get along like a house on fire.
d_counseling_redhood_05_10,Red Hood and I discuss the qualities a commander should possess.
d_counseling_redhood_06_1,"Sometimes, I have this nagging feeling..."
d_counseling_redhood_06_2,What kind of feeling?
d_counseling_redhood_06_3,"My time has already come and gone,"
d_counseling_redhood_06_4,"and yet, I still exist in this world."
d_counseling_redhood_06_5,"It's a strange thought, and whenever it pops up in my mind, I'm a bit unsettled."
d_counseling_redhood_06_6,I think that's a perfectly normal reaction.
d_counseling_redhood_06_7,Shouldn't you be excited at having a new lease on life?
d_counseling_redhood_06_8,Yeah? I thought you'd be weirded out by it as well.
d_counseling_redhood_06_9,Thanks for understanding.
d_counseling_redhood_06_10,"Nevertheless, I still intend to give this body back to Rapi ASAP, so don't worry about that."
d_counseling_redhood_06_11,"Hey, how could you say that? Rapi wouldn't be too happy hearing that."
d_counseling_redhood_06_12,And it was you who told me to get your oh-so-precious Rapi back to you as soon as possible.
d_counseling_redhood_06_13,"There's a time for joking around, and there's a time to be serious."
d_counseling_redhood_06_14,Red Hood and I continue to discuss the intricacies of emotions for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_07_1,I'm curious:
d_counseling_redhood_07_2,Is Rapunzel still fixated on... you know what?
d_counseling_redhood_07_3,I'm not sure what you're alluding to.
d_counseling_redhood_07_4,More than ever.
d_counseling_redhood_07_5,... Handsome.
d_counseling_redhood_07_6,Stop pretending.
d_counseling_redhood_07_7,You know what I'm talking about. When a man and a woman... you know...
d_counseling_redhood_07_8,Er...
d_counseling_redhood_07_9,Some things never change.
d_counseling_redhood_07_10,"On that note,"
d_counseling_redhood_07_11,any interesting new books on that particular subject?
d_counseling_redhood_07_12,"I'd like some recommendations... Uh, I mean...!"
d_counseling_redhood_07_13,Red Hood becomes bashful and clams up for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_08_1,"Say,"
d_counseling_redhood_08_2,is our favorite swordsman still living life to the hilt?
d_counseling_redhood_08_3,"Very much so, all with the help of alcohol."
d_counseling_redhood_08_4,Maybe? Not sure.
d_counseling_redhood_08_5,"Ha, good grief."
d_counseling_redhood_08_6,It sometimes looks like she's more of a professional boozer than a swordsman.
d_counseling_redhood_08_7,Just be sure to check in with her once in a while. Don't let her spiral into addiction.
d_counseling_redhood_08_8,It seems you don't know too much about her whereabouts.
d_counseling_redhood_08_9,So she's still a bona fide walkabout?
d_counseling_redhood_08_10,Fair enough. That way of life suits her well.
d_counseling_redhood_08_11,Talked about Scarlet with Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_09_1,"How's my buddy, Snow White?"
d_counseling_redhood_09_2,Is she still as adorable as before?
d_counseling_redhood_09_3,Utterly irresistible.
d_counseling_redhood_09_4,The relationship between you two is... rather unusual.
d_counseling_redhood_09_5,"Ha, she really is, isn't she?"
d_counseling_redhood_09_6,I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told anyone else.
d_counseling_redhood_09_7,There's no better feeling than getting her in a solid headlock with only one arm.
d_counseling_redhood_09_8,Her reaction is simply adorable.
d_counseling_redhood_09_9,Huh? What's so strange about it?
d_counseling_redhood_09_10,She's as cute as a button! No one can deny that.
d_counseling_redhood_09_11,"Oh, you know what? There was this one time..."
d_counseling_redhood_09_12,"Red Hood goes on to tell various stories about Snow White, but it feels like she is describing a completely different person."
d_counseling_redhood_10_1,Tell me something.
d_counseling_redhood_10_2,Do you ask a different Nikke out every day?
d_counseling_redhood_10_3,Yeah.
d_counseling_redhood_10_4,Not necessarily.
d_counseling_redhood_10_5,"Oh, so you just pick the Nikke you want?"
d_counseling_redhood_10_6,And you switch it up each day?
d_counseling_redhood_10_7,I never realized that before. You're kinda creepy.
d_counseling_redhood_10_8,I guess that's one of the privileges of being a commander. I'm so jealous!
d_counseling_redhood_10_9,So how do you decide who to go with?
d_counseling_redhood_10_10,I can't tell you the details.
d_counseling_redhood_10_11,Oh? Sounds awfully suspicious to me.
d_counseling_redhood_10_12,I think you just pick whichever Nikke you're jonesing after and ask them out.
d_counseling_redhood_10_13,"That way you can satisfy your base desires and have your way with them, am I right?"
d_counseling_redhood_10_14,Red Hood teases me for quite some time with a rakish grin on her face.
d_counseling_redhood_11_1,I hope Dorothy
d_counseling_redhood_11_2,doesn't step out of line.
d_counseling_redhood_11_3,I'll do my best to persuade her whenever I can.
d_counseling_redhood_11_4,"Bit late for that, isn't it?"
d_counseling_redhood_11_5,I knew I could count on you.
d_counseling_redhood_11_6,"Thanks, Handsome."
d_counseling_redhood_11_7,I hope you can continue to look after her on my behalf.
d_counseling_redhood_11_8,Mmm...
d_counseling_redhood_11_9,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_redhood_11_10,Things do seem to have reached the point of no return.
d_counseling_redhood_11_11,*Sigh* What a mess.
d_counseling_redhood_11_12,Red Hood and I discuss Dorothy for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_12_1,"Hey,"
d_counseling_redhood_12_2,guess who made this weapon I'm using?
d_counseling_redhood_12_3,Dorothy?
d_counseling_redhood_12_4,Snow White?
d_counseling_redhood_12_5,"Pssh, are you kidding?"
d_counseling_redhood_12_6,"The lady who's always bloviating about how ""barbaric"""
d_counseling_redhood_12_7,it is to fight with your hands?
d_counseling_redhood_12_8,"You think she, of all people, would craft a weapon with her own hands? You should tell that joke to any Raptures we pass by. They'll die of laughter."
d_counseling_redhood_12_9,Correct yet again. Maybe that was a softball.
d_counseling_redhood_12_10,I still remember her face when I asked her to make me an automatic drill.
d_counseling_redhood_12_11,She had no idea what I was talking about. Completely dumbfounded.
d_counseling_redhood_12_12,It was adorable. Haha.
d_counseling_redhood_12_13,Red Hood and I discuss weapons for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_13_1,You wanna know what the first book I gave Rapunzel was called?
d_counseling_redhood_13_2,Blinding Passion.
d_counseling_redhood_13_3,Eager & Insatiable.
d_counseling_redhood_13_4,What the...?!
d_counseling_redhood_13_5,How in the world did you guess that?
d_counseling_redhood_13_6,You must be an avid collector of this kind of material.
d_counseling_redhood_13_7,What the...?!
d_counseling_redhood_13_8,There's a book called that? That's a heck of a title. Very promising.
d_counseling_redhood_13_9,What's it about? Tell me!
d_counseling_redhood_13_10,Out with it!
d_counseling_redhood_13_11,Red Hood and I discuss adult books for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_14_1,"Red Hood is listening to her cassette player, as she usually does."
d_counseling_redhood_14_2,I love the sense of ceremony that comes with listening to music on a cassette recorder.
d_counseling_redhood_14_3,Don't you agree?
d_counseling_redhood_14_4,It's more convenient with a cellphone.
d_counseling_redhood_14_5,I prefer vinyl records.
d_counseling_redhood_14_6,"Ugh, you're such a philistine."
d_counseling_redhood_14_7,The audio would be way too sterile if you play it over a cellphone.
d_counseling_redhood_14_8,It ruins the fun and thrill of listening to music.
d_counseling_redhood_14_9,"Wow, no kidding?"
d_counseling_redhood_14_10,I didn't realize you were so refined.
d_counseling_redhood_14_11,"You remind of me Dorothy, haha."
d_counseling_redhood_14_12,Discussed music with Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_15_1,"Whenever I see rabble-rousers or people with glasses,"
d_counseling_redhood_15_2,I'm already reminded of Scarlet and Dorothy as they used to be.
d_counseling_redhood_15_3,Did they fight a lot?
d_counseling_redhood_15_4,Did they get along?
d_counseling_redhood_15_5,Their feuding was the stuff of legend.
d_counseling_redhood_15_6,They'd spend entire days finding new ways to push each other's buttons.
d_counseling_redhood_15_7,"I'd watch them, engrossed entirely, and hours would pass by without me even noticing, ha."
d_counseling_redhood_15_8,...
d_counseling_redhood_15_9,Has anyone ever told you that you have no clue how to read the room?
d_counseling_redhood_15_10,No.
d_counseling_redhood_15_11,...
d_counseling_redhood_15_12,I somehow seriously doubt that.
d_counseling_redhood_15_13,Chatted with Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_16_1,"Hey, guess what I'm describing:"
d_counseling_redhood_16_2,"It's white and supple, and feels tender to the touch."
d_counseling_redhood_16_3,Cotton?
d_counseling_redhood_16_4,Snow?
d_counseling_redhood_16_5,"Sorry, wrong answer."
d_counseling_redhood_16_6,It's Snow White when she's sleeping.
d_counseling_redhood_16_7,*Sigh*
d_counseling_redhood_16_8,"Gosh, I miss her more than anything."
d_counseling_redhood_16_9,"Close, but no cigar."
d_counseling_redhood_16_10,It's Snow White when she's sleeping.
d_counseling_redhood_16_11,"Every once in a while, I find myself thinking about her."
d_counseling_redhood_16_12,I really do miss her more than anything.
d_counseling_redhood_16_13,Red Hood and I absent-mindedly stare up at the sky for a while.
d_counseling_redhood_17_1,"You may find this hard to believe,"
d_counseling_redhood_17_2,but Dorothy had a cute side to her as well.
d_counseling_redhood_17_3,Quit pulling my leg.
d_counseling_redhood_17_4,Are we thinking of the same Dorothy?
d_counseling_redhood_17_5,I'm not joking. I mean it.
d_counseling_redhood_17_6,"For example, how mad she'd get if you called her ""Snooty"","
d_counseling_redhood_17_7,"or the way she pretended to be indifferent about something, when everyone else could clearly see how upset she was."
d_counseling_redhood_17_8,Actually...
d_counseling_redhood_17_9,"Now that I think about it, maybe those can't really be filed under ""cute""."
d_counseling_redhood_17_10,Of course we are!
d_counseling_redhood_17_11,"There's only one true fair lady, and that's our dear Snooty Dorothy."
d_counseling_redhood_17_12,"She looks radically different from how she did in the past,"
d_counseling_redhood_17_13,so I can't blame you finding it hard to imagine another side of her.
d_counseling_redhood_17_14,Red Hood tells me more about how Dorothy differed in the past.
d_counseling_redhood_18_1,"Hello, Commander."
d_counseling_redhood_18_2,Long time no see.
d_counseling_redhood_18_3,... Rapi?
d_counseling_redhood_18_4,"Red Hood, are you trying to sound like Rapi?"
d_counseling_redhood_18_5,"Hey, come on, Handsome,"
d_counseling_redhood_18_6,no need to look so down in the dumps.
d_counseling_redhood_18_7,I was only playing a little practical joke.
d_counseling_redhood_18_8,"Chin up, okay?"
d_counseling_redhood_18_9,"Ha, darn!"
d_counseling_redhood_18_10,You saw right through me.
d_counseling_redhood_18_11,You really live up to that commander title.
d_counseling_redhood_18_12,I'm impressed.
d_counseling_redhood_18_13,I suddenly find myself missing Rapi more than ever.
d_counseling_redhood_19_1,"What do you think about old antiques,"
d_counseling_redhood_19_2,"like this cassette player, for instance?"
d_counseling_redhood_19_3,I think they're cool.
d_counseling_redhood_19_4,I think they're old.
d_counseling_redhood_19_5,"Not a bad answer,"
d_counseling_redhood_19_6,Handsome!
d_counseling_redhood_19_7,I've always preferred things with a history as well.
d_counseling_redhood_19_8,Bah. What a boring answer.
d_counseling_redhood_19_9,It's an antique. Of course it's going to be old.
d_counseling_redhood_19_10,Red Hood and I exchange our opinions on antiques.
d_counseling_redhood_20_1,What's your stance on past achievements?
d_counseling_redhood_20_2,Do you think they have any real meaning?
d_counseling_redhood_20_3,I think they hold a lot of value.
d_counseling_redhood_20_4,I think their value is limited.
d_counseling_redhood_20_5,I see.
d_counseling_redhood_20_6,But isn't it a bit of a shame if someone rests on their laurels
d_counseling_redhood_20_7,and is unable to move on?
d_counseling_redhood_20_8,I wish there was a way I could get that through Dorothy's head.
d_counseling_redhood_20_9,"Haha, I see."
d_counseling_redhood_20_10,"Personally, I think you're right. The past is the past."
d_counseling_redhood_20_11,We need to live in the present.
d_counseling_redhood_20_12,"Right now, at this very moment, the future is barreling towards us,"
d_counseling_redhood_20_13,"and that makes it all the more vital, certainly much more so than the past."
d_counseling_redhood_20_14,Red Hood and I have a deep and meaningful conversation.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_2,She concentrates on polishing her weapon.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_3,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_4,What's this? A new toy?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_5,Cool weapon.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_6,It's not a toy!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_7,"Go away, Commander!"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_8,Huh...?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_9,How did you know?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_10,"Yeah, it's a modified..."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_11,What's that other thing beside you? Some kind of toy?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_12,"Oh, this?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_13,"It's a pistol, not a toy!"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_14,"If you've come here just to tease me again, you can leave."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_15,*Bang*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_01_16,I guess people are right when they say teens are temperamental.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_2,"Commander,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_3,how can I become as strong as Lilith?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_4,That's something you must figure out for yourself.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_5,Have you not gotten enough sleep or something?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_6,"Oh, okay..."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_7,I see.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_8,I'll try my best.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_9,"There you go again, treating me like a child!"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_10,"You just wait and see,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_11,I'll become stronger for sure!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_02_12,Snow White storms off into her room and spends some time alone thinking.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_2,Commander...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_3,Yes?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_4,What are you eating?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_5,"Oh, this?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_6,Share snack with Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_7,Pretend to share snack with Snow White.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_8,Have some.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_9,Thanks!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_10,*Munch munch*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_11,It's delicious!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_12,Here.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_13,Thanks.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_14,*Yoink*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_15,Huh...?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_16,"After feigning that I'm going to share my snack with Snow White, I proceed to yank it back and eat it myself."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_17,"Ah, delicious."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_18,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_03_19,"After getting the snack, Snow White goes back to her room happily."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_2,"Commander,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_3,why does Red Hood always make fun of me?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_4,Because you're so cute.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_5,Because she considers you a good friend.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_6,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_7,"That's just a nice way of saying she considers me a child, isn't it?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_9,How could I not? It's so obvious.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_10,...!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_11,I see.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_12,She's always pranking me because she's fond of me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_13,"Thanks for letting me know, Commander."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_04_14,"Snow White turns to head back to her room, and is promptly put into a headlock by Red Hood."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_2,"Commander, Red Hood told me the nudie mag she has"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_3,was a gift from you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_4,Is that true?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_5,Not at all.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_6,"Yes, it's true."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_7,I knew it.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_8,You wouldn't be caught dead with that kind of reading material.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_9,I'm glad my hunch was correct.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_10,...!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_11,For real?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_12,Just kidding. She's lying.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_13,I knew it!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_14,What a relief.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_05_15,"Snow White returns to her room, thoroughly reassured."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_2,Scarlet's sword is amazing.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_3,"Sometimes, it looks as though it has a life of its own."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_4,You didn't know? It is alive.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_5,Perhaps because she wields it with such passion.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_6,"""Gee willikers, no kidding!"""
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_7,...Is that what you expected me to say?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_8,"I'm not as gullible as you think, Commander."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_9,Right...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_10,I think Scarlet said something like that before.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_11,"It's a good thing I asked you, hehe."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_12,Thanks.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_06_13,"After returning to her room, Snow White decides to delve seriously into swords again."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_2,Dorothy always seems hard to approach.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_3,"Do you get the same feeling, Commander?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_4,"Yeah, she can be a bit standoffish."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_5,Hmm...is she? I've never felt anything like that.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_6,"I wouldn't go as far as saying ""standoffish"", but..."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_7,How should I put it...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_8,She's a bit like you when you get upset.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_9,"... Right, I nearly forgot."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_10,You can make friends with everyone so easily.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_11,I suppose that would make you approachable.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_12,Why does it feel like there's a hidden meaning there...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_07_13,"Even after Snow White returns to her room, she continues to think about Dorothy's temperament."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_2,Rapunzel has been acting a little strange lately.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_3,"She'll breathe all heavily, and her face turns beet red."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_4,What's going on with her?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_5,I think she's gotten addicted to that nudie mag.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_6,"She's attempting mightily to be reborn as a true saint, so she needs all the help you can give her."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_7,?!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_8,I can't believe she'd become addicted to such smut!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_9,!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_10,Could it be because of Red Hood?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_11,A true saint?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_12,"... Wow, amazing."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_13,So that's what you have to go through to achieve sainthood?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_08_14,"In the end, Snow White doesn't get a satisfactory answer."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_2,I want to become as mature as Lilith.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_3,"That way, I'll be able to get back at Red Hood whenever she teases me."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_4,I don't think being mature has anything to do with it.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_5,"Sorry to tell you, but I don't think it's possible for you to ever become like Lilith."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_6,You think so?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_7,"Oh, I get it!"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_8,You're saying I can get back at Red Hood whenever I want!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_9,"Hehe, thanks, Commander!"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_10,I'll think of something.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_11,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_12,"You didn't have to rub it in my face, you know."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_13,You're worse than Red Hood sometimes.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_14,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_09_15,"Snow White storms off, leaving me behind, slightly hurt and bewildered."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_2,"Ugh, Commander."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_3,Could you please have a word with Scarlet and Dorothy?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_4,They had another squabble today and made a total mess of the barracks.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_5,"Okay, but just one word, no more."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_6,"Okay, I'll tell them to behave."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_7,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_8,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_9,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_10,You don't have to look at me like you want to squash me under your bootheel...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_11,Wow...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_12,What?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_13,Uh... Nothing. Thanks.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_14,...?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_15,"It's just that I thought you'd brush me off again, but you didn't."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_10_16,Snow White hurries back to her room.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_2,"If there's any kind of weapon that you need,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_3,"just let me know,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_4,and I can make it for you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_5,I don't need anything as long as I have you protecting me.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_6,"It's okay, what I have right now suits me just fine."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_7,!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_8,"Well, of course I'll always protect you."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_9,"But I may not always be around,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_10,"so all the same, feel free to tell me if you need anything crafted."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_11,"I've had a look at your current loadout,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_12,and it's seen better days.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_13,"You really should let me craft a new one for you,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_14,or at least let me refurbish your current arsenal.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_15,Is that okay?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_11_16,"After some quibbling back and forth, I finally relent, and Snow White leaves content with the outcome."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_2,"What do you usually do when you've got some time to rest, Commander?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_3,"I take a rest, literally."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_4,Take a guess.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_5,Makes sense.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_6,Sufficient rest is imperative for a healthy body and mind.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_7,"Exactly, so you should go to bed at a reasonable hour instead of staying up all night polishing your weapon."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_8,...!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_9,How did you know?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_10,Hmm... I think you...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_11,Meditate?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_12,That's correct.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_13,"You're not just saying that, are you?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_12_14,Snow White goes back early to rest.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_2,"If we reclaim the surface,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_3,what do you intend to do there?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_4,"To be honest, I've never given it much thought."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_5,I suppose I'd go on an outing with all of you.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_6,I thought that might be the case.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_7,Do you have any suggestions?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_8,I...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_9,I want to go on a trip.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_10,"With everyone else, I mean."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_11,You mean like a trip?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_12,That'd be nice.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_13,I'd love to go with you!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_13_14,"Back in her room, Snow White daydreams of reclaiming the surface."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_2,"Commander, do you cherish old stuff of yours more?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_3,They do have their own unique charm.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_4,"No, I have no attachment to old things."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_5,Red Hood said the same thing.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_6,"You two really do have a lot in common,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_7,even down to the fact that you both talk super loudly.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_8,"Oh, that's surprising."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_9,I thought for sure that you'd say you did.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_14_10,"Our conversation is interrupted by Lilith, who comes in to notify us about mealtime."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_2,Why don't Scarlet and Dorothy get along?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_3,They're always at each others' throats whenever they're in the same room.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_4,Maybe they were enemies in a past life.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_5,Maybe that's just their way of showing affection.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_6,"... Do Nikkes have past lives, too?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_7,I think so... maybe?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_8,"You just made that up, didn't you?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_9,Ugh. Why do I even bother?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_10,I don't know about that.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_11,Some of their fights have gotten so bad that I was worried one of them might end up dead.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_12,"But still, they are squadmates. Maybe you're right."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_15_13,"Later that day, Snow White once again spends time breaking up yet another altercation between Scarlet and Dorothy."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_2,"Commander, what kind of weather do you prefer?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_3,Sunny or cloudy?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_4,Neither.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_5,I actually prefer snowy days.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_6,Huh?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_7,So what do you like?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_8,It's a secret.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_9,"Aw, come on! That's not nice."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_10,So your favorite weather involves snow? How unique...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_11,Wait...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_12,Why are you staring at me like that?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_13,What is it?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_16_14,"That night, for some reason, Snow White finds herself unable to sleep."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_2,Sometimes I have nightmares at night.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_3,I dream that everyone has disappeared and I've been left all alone.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_4,How about I sleep next to you tonight?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_5,"It's all just a dream, nothing more."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_6,W-what are you saying?!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_7,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_8,That won't be necessary.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_9,"Sorry, but can we take a small break?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_10,"I know that,"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_11,but they were so vivid...it all felt so real.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_12,"Fortunately, they only last for a while."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_13,"Anyway, I'm going to take a short break."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_17_14,Snow White falls asleep almost immediately.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_2,"Hello, Commander."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_3,Snow White is holding a steaming potato.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_4,Would you like to share this potato?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_5,I'm good. It's all yours.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_6,"Okay then, just a little bite."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_7,"Hehe, thanks."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_8,I'm famished. I could eat several of these.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_9,"Okay, here you go."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_10,*Chomp*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_11,"Hey, you call that a bite?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_12,You nearly ate the whole thing!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_13,Give it back!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_18_14,"Snow White, still hungry, sets out to forage for other food."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_2,She is sleeping.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_3,Wake her up by poking her cheek.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_4,Wake her up by tickling her nose.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_5,*Poke*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_6,Mmm...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_7,*Poke poke*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_8,Mmm...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_9,?!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_10,"Oh jeez, I must have fallen asleep while polishing my weapons."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_11,"Thanks for waking me up, Commander."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_12,*Tickle*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_13,Mmm...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_14,*Tickle tickle*
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_15,Achoo!
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_16,... Hmm? Commander?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_17,Is it raining outside?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_18,Why are you so wet?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_19_19,Snow White goes back to her room and sleeps soundly that night.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_1,"Snow White closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_2,"Do you have any hobbies, Commander?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_3,Or something that you enjoy doing?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_4,Kind of like me with crafting weapons.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_5,"Honestly, I'm a big fan of times like these. What we're doing right now."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_6,"Nothing in particular, I'm afraid."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_7,Really?
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_8,...
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_9,"Me too. Well, at least I certainly don't find it unpleasant..."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_10,"Times like these, that is."
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_11,Same old answer.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_12,"Anyway, would you like some mints?"
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_13,You yelled a whole bunch during the meeting earlier.
d_counseling_snowwhite_young_20_14,Snow White proceeds to have an ordinary day like any other.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_1,Cleaning is just the best.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_2,"Nothing beats seeing the satisfaction on other peoples' faces once you've got a place spick and span,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_3,and you're always filled with a sense of pride once you're done cleaning.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_4,Looks like you might have a lot on your plate. Do you want some help?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_5,Looking forward to seeing you work your magic in the future.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_6,"Oh, I'm okay."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_7,I know that you're rather busy yourself.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_8,I'll be able to clean this place just fine on my own.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_9,"Thanks for your concern, though! Hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_10,"Hehe, you just wait and see!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_11,This place is gonna be immaculate.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_01_12,Mica thoroughly cleans the dormitory.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_1,Where is your favorite spot in Snowfield?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_2,"The restaurant, because you can taste a wide variety of dishes there."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_3,The breathtaking waterfall.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_4,"Wow, have you and Belorta been talking?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_5,She said the restaurant was her favorite as well.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_6,She loves the warmth from the ovens and the aromas that are produced during mealtimes.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_7,Whoa! Me too!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_8,I love the waterfall.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_9,"The way the water comes crashing down, it's just so soothing."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_10,"Whenever I watch it, it makes me feel reinvigorated somehow."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_11,"I really like that, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_02_12,I have a conversation with Mica about the places we like in Snowfield.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_1,W-welcome to Snowfield Hot Spring!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_2,...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_3,How was that greeting?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_4,You need to have a bit more confidence.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_5,I like the energy that you're bringing to it.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_6,Okay...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_7,"Darn, I practiced so many times..."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_8,Was it really that easy to tell that I was nervous?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_9,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_10,"That's reassuring, because I've really been practicing hard on it."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_11,I read somewhere that
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_12,the initial greeting when you enter a place is very important.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_13,"I'm still a bit nervous about it, though, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_03_14,I help Mica practice her greeting and become more confident.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_1,The hot spring is fantastic.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_2,"It relaxes you, and all your fatigue just melts away."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_3,"Do you enjoy it as well, Old-Timer?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_4,It's the best. I try and go whenever I have the chance.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_5,"It's great, but the water is a tad too hot."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_6,"Wow, so you go as much as possible?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_7,"Oh my goodness, you're practically beaming right now."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_8,You must really love it if just thinking about it makes you this happy.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_9,"Belorta has that same expression when she's eating a good meal, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_10,"Oh, you think so?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_11,"Well, I guess it's difficult to regulate the temperature of the hot spring separately."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_12,Just be careful not to get burned!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_04_13,I have a conversation with Mica about the advantages of hot springs.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_1,The hot springs at Snowfield feel different from the others you find on the surface.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_2,There's something special about them.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_3,What do you think that is?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_4,Because we get to be here with the people we love?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_5,Maybe because this place is surrounded by snow?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_6,"Hey, you may be onto something!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_7,"Belorta and Ludmilla are here,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_8,and so are you!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_9,"Hey, you're right!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_10,"You don't get to see snow very often in the Ark,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_11,so that must be why it feels extra special.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_05_12,I have a conversation with Mica about why Snowfield Hot Spring feels particularly special.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_1,"Old-Timer, come look at this."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_2,I found a whole bunch today.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_3,I was really selective and only picked ones that looked really smooth. What do you think?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_4,Mica opens her hands to reveal a small pile of stones of various shapes.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_5,They all... look pretty similar to me.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_6,They're so pretty. Like little gemstones.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_7,What?! You really think that?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_8,"No, come on, if you look closely here, this one has a faint white hue to it."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_9,This one has stripes.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_10,And here...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_11,I thought the exact same thing!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_12,"I picked them out super carefully, one by one."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_13,"If any particular one catches your eye, let me know and I can give it to you as a gift."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_06_14,Mica carefully goes over the various features of her stone collection to me.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_1,"Old-Timer,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_2,do you think I look good in this outfit?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_3,"Yeah, it suits you."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_4,"Yeah, it goes well with the surroundings of Snowfield Hot Spring."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_5,...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_6,"Thank you for the compliment, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_7,Hehe... I'm glad you feel that way.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_8,Huh? I wasn't really talking about that...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_9,??
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_10,... Never mind.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_07_11,I have a conversation with Mica about the clothes she is wearing.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_1,"Whenever I walk around Snowfield Hot Spring,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_2,sometimes it feels like I'm dreaming.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_3,I never expected I'd get to see so much snow on the surface in my life.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_4,You mean you didn't know? This is all a dream.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_5,Sometimes I feel that way too.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_6,What?! Really?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_7,"If this is a dream, I don't want to ever wake up."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_8,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_9,"So I'm not the only one who feels that way, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_08_10,I have a conversation with Mica about the beautiful snow-covered scenery of Snowfield Hot Spring.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_1,Mica is arranging various fireworks and appears to be deep in thought.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_2,"Belorta and I are having a fireworks display tonight,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_3,and I'm trying to figure out which fireworks to bring.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_4,"Which one do you like, Old-Timer?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_5,Hmm... I like this heart-shaped firework.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_6,Hmm... I like this star-shaped firework.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_7,"This one is Belorta's favorite,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_8,so I prepared plenty in advance.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_9,What about the others? Any that catches your eye?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_10,"Wow, no kidding!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_11,"That's the one I like as well, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_12,So I brought plenty of them.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_13,What about the others? Any that catches your eye?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_09_14,I spend time with Mica choosing between different types of fireworks.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_1,"Old-Timer,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_2,my body feels kinda funny.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_3,"I just ate something,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_4,but I wasn't able to taste anything!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_5,Were you eating Emma's cooking?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_6,What was it that you ate? Something unusual?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_7,Wha...?!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_9,"Yeah, Emma was on cooking duty today."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_10,Not at all.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_11,It was a perfectly normal dish.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_12,Was it something that Emma had prepared?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_13,"Huh? Yeah, how did you know?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_14,"I ate the very same thing earlier, and I wasn't able to taste anything either."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_10_15,Mica and I have a conversation about Emma's strange and bewildering cooking.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_1,"Since coming to Snowfield Hot Spring, Belorta and I have received a lot of help from Ludmilla."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_2,So I want to give her a gift as a token of my appreciation.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_3,What do you think would be a great gift?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_4,Why don't you just ask her what she wants?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_5,Why don't you discuss it with Belorta?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_6,"That's a good idea,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_7,but Belorta and I wanted to make it a surprise.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_8,So asking her isn't really an option.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_9,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_10,"Ludmilla is a big fan of tea,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_11,so Belorta and I will find out what type she likes in particular.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_12,"Thanks, Old-Timer!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_11_13,Mica and I think about what gifts to give Ludmilla.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_1,"The sleeves on this shirt are a bit long,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_2,which really hampers my cleaning.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_3,Use a ribbon to secure Mica's sleeves.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_4,Roll up Mica's sleeves.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_5,How about this?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_6,Nice!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_7,"I can move around all I want, and it doesn't go anywhere."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_8,"It's really comfortable, too. Thanks!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_9,How about this?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_10,Let's see... oops!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_11,It came undone...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_12,I think I need something that'll be able to secure it firmly.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_12_13,I teach Mica various ways to firmly secure her sleeves.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_1,"Old-Timer, do I look strange?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_2,What do you mean?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_3,Well... to be honest...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_4,I think I look kind of weird without applying camo cream.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_5,"You're naturally cute, so any look you adopt is fine."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_6,You look even cuter without applying camo cream.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_7,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_8,It makes me happy hearing you say that.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_9,You think so?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_10,Maybe I just can't get used to not applying it.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_11,"I can certainly try to, though."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_13_12,Mica and I have a conversation about camo cream.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_1,"I got you a gift,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_2,Old-Timer.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_3,Mica hands over a small snowman.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_4,Thank you. Did you make this yourself?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_5,It's a bit warm in here. Are you sure it won't melt?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_6,I sure did!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_7,"I used some of the stones I collected for the eyes and nose, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_8,I'm glad you like it.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_9,Oh no! I worked so hard on it. I don't want it to melt!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_10,Should I take it back outside?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_14_11,"To prevent it from melting, Mica places the snowman in a shady area outside."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_1,"Whenever I have a snowball fight with Belorta,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_2,I always lose.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_3,I'd like to win at least once...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_4,"Belorta always aims for the face, so it's hard to beat her."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_5,You should do what she does.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_6,Try using some unique weaponry.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_7,Huh?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_8,But she's so fast...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_9,"By the time I'm halfway through rolling up a snowball, she's already finished with hers."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_10,"I guess I'm out of options, though... I might as well try it."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_11,Like what?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_12,I hand Mica her weapon.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_13,A frying pan?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_14,"Ah, are you saying I should use this to cover my face?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_15,This will definitely work to block any incoming snowballs.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_16,Thanks. I'll be sure to win next time!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_15_17,"A few hours later, Mica returns with a despondent face, indicating that victory is still a long way off."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_1,"When I went to the restaurant, they had rice balls, so I tried them."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_2,They were delicious!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_3,I was wondering if you'd made them?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_4,Or maybe it was Emma?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_5,It definitely wasn't Emma.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_6,I think it might have been Emma.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_7,You don't think so?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_8,I thought it had either been you or her.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_9,Guess it was neither of you.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_10,I knew it was her!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_11,The only thing was... those rice balls were absolutely scrumptious.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_12,The ones Emma used to make had chocolate in them.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_13,"On second thought, perhaps it wasn't Emma who made them."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_14,Then who did?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_16_15,Mica and I attempt to ascertain who made the delicious rice balls.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_1,I'm always so happy whenever I'm with Blanc and Noir.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_2,Why is that?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_3,"They're both so kind, and beautiful, and get along so well."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_4,"Yeah, whenever you're with those two, it's a good time."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_5,"Honestly, I'm more happy when I'm spending time with you and Belorta."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_6,Hmm?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_7,"Are you okay, Old-Timer?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_8,Your face is turning red.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_9,R-really?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_10,I feel the same way!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_11,"Whenever I'm with you,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_12,I feel way better! Hehe.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_17_13,I have a conversation with Mica about people that make us feel good.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_1,"I once got lost around here,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_2,and Ludmilla came to find me.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_3,"When I saw her appear on the horizon, she seemed like a true Snow Queen!"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_4,You must've been frightened losing your way. Try not to stray off too far in the future.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_5,Ludmilla always has a regal air about her.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_6,"I guess cool people share certain similarities when it comes to this stuff,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_7,"because Ludmilla said something similar to you, Old-Timer."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_8,"That's true,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_9,but it seemed particularly apparent that day.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_10,"I dunno, it's hard to explain in words."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_18_11,I have a conversation with Mica about Ludmilla.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_1,Old-Timer! I have a question!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_2,Do you prefer strong scents or something more subtle?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_3,Subtle.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_4,Strong.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_5,"Phew, I'm glad."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_6,"I got some incense to help me sleep at night,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_7,and it happens to have a subtle aroma. Heh.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_8,R-really?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_9,Why do you ask?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_10,"I got some incense to help me sleep at night,"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_11,but it has a subtle aroma.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_12,"J-just a moment. If you wait, I'll go change..."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_13,"It's okay, I'll use this. Thank you."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_19_14,I spend time with Mica asking each other about the scents we like.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_1,Let me show you something interesting!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_2,*Phoooooo*
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_3,"Mica blows on a pile of snow in her hand, sending the flakes scattering into the air."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_4,"Pretty cool, huh?"
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_5,"Mmm, very interesting."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_6,Where did you get that snow?
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_7,...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_8,That response didn't sound very sincere...
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_9,You don't have to pretend to be excited if you're not.
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_10,It just started snowing a moment ago!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_11,I grabbed a handful of snow
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_12,"so that I could show it to you, hehe."
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_13,It was worth it!
d_counseling_mica_snowbuddy_20_14,Mica and I have a conversation about the mystery of snow.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_1,It's nice that there aren't many machines here at Snowfield.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_2,I don't have to worry about my hands wreaking havoc on the place.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_3,I'm actually a little bummed now that I have less work to do.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_4,That's great.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_5,Haha!
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_6,I suppose I didn't factor your feelings into the equation.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_7,I appreciate your desire to help me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_8,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_9,"So, feel free to kick back and relax in the hot spring."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_01_10,Ludmilla and I have a good time at the hot spring together.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_1,I received information about a new hot spring.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_2,One that's not too far from here.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_3,Servant.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_4,Hand over a shovel.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_5,Prepare to go out with the shovel in hand.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_6,Surely you're not insinuating that I should have to do the digging myself?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_7,... Sorry.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_8,I will forgive you for this transgression.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_9,"Now, bring that shovel and follow me."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_10,Well done.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_11,"Bring that shovel, and follow me."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_12,I hope this is a big hot spring.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_02_13,"I proceeded to work hard at digging, all under Ludmilla's supervision."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_1,"It's good that we have so many guests at the hot spring now,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_2,but I'm worried that many of them don't know proper bathing etiquette.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_3,"Do you know the rules of which I speak, Servant?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_4,"When entering the hot spring, you should cover your body with a towel."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_5,"Before entering the hot spring, you should wash your body."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_6,Not necessarily.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_7,"Many TV shows depict people covering themselves with a towel before entering a bath,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_8,and so lots of people mistakenly feel they must do the same.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_9,"In fact, entering with a towel on is considered impolite."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_10,What's shown on TV is just for show.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_11,"Next time, I hope you can display proper bathing etiquette while enjoying the hot spring."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_12,That's correct.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_13,Entering the bath without washing beforehand could negatively affect other customers' experiences.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_14,If I were to see something dirty floating in the water...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_15,I don't even want to imagine how I'd feel.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_03_16,I discuss bathing etiquette with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_1,"Servant, prepare the tea."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_2,"Today, I would like to drink tea that fits thematically with the hot spring."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_3,Prepare green tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_4,Prepare jasmine tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_5,So you've made green tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_6,"Green tea after a bath might be bitter, but it is also quite smooth, and therefore is an excellent choice."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_7,"Well done, Servant."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_8,So you've made jasmine tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_9,"While this is my favorite, I was in the mood for something else today."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_10,"However, since you have already prepared it, I will drink it."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_04_11,I enjoy a cup of tea with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_1,"Apparently, vacation resorts are sometimes frequented by rather rowdy groups."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_2,"While I understand vacation can be exciting, I feel you should be mindful of others around you."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_3,What do you think?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_4,"None of us here are too loud, so it doesn't matter."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_5,We should remind everyone of this beforehand so nothing like that happens.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_6,Hahaha!
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_7,Belorta! Wait for me!
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_8,...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_9,...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_10,That's right.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_11,Isn't the true definition of a vacation
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_12,for everyone participating to feel good and have a good time?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_05_13,Ludmilla and I have a conversation about the type of people you hate at vacation resorts.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_1,"I feel like we should have our session outside today, just for a change of pace."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_2,Is there anywhere you'd like to go in particular?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_3,The forest next to the hot spring.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_4,The waterfall next to the dormitory.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_5,"Forest, you say?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_6,I can already smell the fresh night air.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_7,Go and prepare the tea which we will drink in the forest.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_8,Servant...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_9,"I've been wondering this for a while now,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_10,but do you have a particular fascination with potentially freezing to death?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_06_11,I have a meaningful time with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_1,Lots of Christmas dishes pair wonderfully with tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_2,Do you have a particular fondness for any?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_3,Cake.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_4,Turkey.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_5,So you like cake as well?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_6,"In my opinion, a slice of cake with a cup of tea is perfection."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_7,"If you prepare the tea, I'll prepare the cake."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_8,Turkey?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_9,"I can't say it's something that pairs particularly well with tea,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_10,but I will indulge you since it's your preference.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_07_11,I spend time with Ludmilla while imagining various delicacies.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_1,"Ludmilla sits on a chair, gazing at the falling snow outside the window."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_2,What should I do?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_3,Watch from afar.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_4,Sit beside her.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_5,"There's no need to keep your distance, Servant. Come sit down."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_6,"I realize that this snow is no different from what I usually see at the northern base,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_7,but it somehow feels different.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_8,Less harsh. Do you feel it too?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_9,"Oh, hello, Servant."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_11,It's interesting.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_12,"I realize that this snow is no different from what I usually see at the northern base,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_13,but it somehow feels different.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_14,"Instead of feeling harsh and frigid, it actually feels comforting."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_15,Maybe it has to do with how you feel about this place.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_16,Yes.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_17,You might be right.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_08_18,I have a heart-to-heart talk with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_1,"There are many things about Snowfield that I feel are worth boasting about,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_2,but the breakfast menu is a particular point of pride for me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_3,How about it? Would you like to try our breakfast?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_4,"I only eat twice a day, so..."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_5,Of course. Can I have some now?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_6,I see. That's a shame.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_7,Let me know whenever you want to try it.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_8,"Haha, I'm afraid it's a bit late for that now,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_9,but you can come to the restaurant in the morning tomorrow.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_10,"Just so you know,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_11,you'll have to cook it yourself.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_09_12,I have a meaningful time with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_1,I left some pamphlets about the hot spring in front of the entrance to the dormitory.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_2,It wasn't easy collecting all the information to put inside.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_3,"Which sections did you find most interesting, Servant?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_4,The hot spring's history.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_5,The effects of the hot spring.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_6,May I ask why?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_7,I found it fascinating how this place has been enjoyed by people who prioritized a quality lifestyle.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_8,"Haha, you really paid attention."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_9,That's my favorite section as well.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_10,"Personally, I think I'm very much in line with that tradition."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_11,But there were only two lines speaking about the effects of the water...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_12,Servant... did you actually read the pamphlet?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_10_13,I study the history of the hot springs with Ludmilla.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_1,I heard that there were many ghost stories about traveling to the hot springs in the past.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_2,Like people disappearing and the like.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_3,Or a mysterious entity glancing at you from outside the window.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_4,Do you have a fascination with these kinds of ghost stories?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_5,I don't believe in ghost stories.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_6,Wait... are those handprints I see outside the window?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_7,Hmm... I see.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_8,I can understand that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_9,I wanted to share some stories with you but...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_10,Too bad.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_11,"Nice try, Servant. Just because I brought up ghost stories"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_12,doesn't mean I'll fall for a silly old trick like that.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_13,*Bang bang bang*
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_14,Hmm? Who's that knocking on the window?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_15,But... we're not on the first floor.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_16,...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_11_17,I have a cup of tea with Ludmilla to change the atmosphere.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_1,"Servant, what do you typically associate with a hot spring?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_2,Relaxation.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_3,"You, Ludmilla."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_4,"A reasonable answer,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_5,considering how many come to the hot spring for rest.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_6,"Good answer, Servant."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_7,"If I am the first thing you think about when you glance at the northern base,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_8,"the snow and the hot spring, that makes me very happy indeed."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_12_9,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about hot springs.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_1,Christmas isn't Christmas without gifts.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_2,"What gift would you like, Servant?"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_3,Some fine tea.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_4,You.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_5,I didn't realize you liked tea enough to want it as a Christmas gift.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_6,"If you're saying that just to appease me, you don't have to."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_7,Just speak honestly.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_8,Hahaha. That's bold of you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_9,I take it that means you enjoy the time you spend with me?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_10,I'm happy.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_13_11,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about appropriate gifts.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_1,"Servant,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_2,did you feel that anything was lacking during your stay at Snowfield?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_3,There could have been a greater variety of dishes...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_4,Nope. Nothing.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_5,!!
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_6,I see.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_7,"While the quality of our food is exceptional, I suppose it does fall short in terms of variety."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_8,I appreciate the constructive feedback.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_9,Hmm.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_10,"Even though it's me, nothing is perfect."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_11,I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. I thought you would be honest with me.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_14_12,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about the difficulties of the service industry.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_1,"Servant, let me ask you something."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_2,Do you prefer cooking or eating?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_3,Cooking.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_4,Eating.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_5,I'm glad.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_6,Cooking requires a lot of hands-on dedication.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_7,I'll be sure to prepare some of your favorite dishes for you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_8,"Haha, I'd like that."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_9,I look forward to the day that I can taste your cooking.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_10,Hmm... is that so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_11,That's too bad. I was looking forward to your cooking.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_12,"Don't be too hard on yourself though; even if you're no good at cooking, you'll always be my one and only Servant."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_15_13,Ludmilla and I watch a cooking show together.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_1,"What do you think about my new outfit,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_2,Servant?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_3,I prefer how you usually dress.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_4,It's gorgeous.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_5,Is that so?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_6,"I know that what I usually wear suits me,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_7,but I think this looks quite good on me as well.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_8,"Haha, I think the same."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_9,I usually save this outfit for Snowfield Hot Spring.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_10,I'm a big fan of how this brings out my elegance.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_16_11,Ludmilla and I have a conversation about how a queen should dress.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_1,"When things used to be peaceful on the surface,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_2,I heard people went traveling a lot.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_3,Servant.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_4,"When you travel,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_5,"do you prefer traveling alone,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_6,or with others?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_7,I prefer traveling alone.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_8,I prefer traveling with others.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_9,Really?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_10,"I respect your choice, of course,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_11,"but since you tend to get lost quite often, I think it would be best if you travel with others."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_12,Traveling is always better with other people.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_13,"The joy you feel multiplies,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_14,"and more importantly, there's a smaller possibility of running into danger."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_15,I think you'll need a traveling companion.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_17_16,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about how to travel safely.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_1,*Sigh* This is so hard.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_2,"I used to not understand what Liter was talking about when she spoke about her body aching,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_3,but I think I do now.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_4,Running Snowfield Hot Spring is no easy task.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_5,You've got to stay strong.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_6,Get some rest. I'll help you.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_7,You're right.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_8,I'm the owner of this place. It's my responsibility to see that it's run smoothly.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_9,"Thank you, Servant. Your encouragement gave me a second wind."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_10,No.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_11,"You may be my servant, but this is my responsibility."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_12,"I'll accept your thoughts and opinions, but nothing more."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_18_13,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about the difficulties of running things as an owner.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_1,Decorating Snowfield Hot Spring was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_2,I now understand why Mighty Tools makes this their life's work.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_3,Have you ever considered joining Mighty Tools?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_4,I still think being a queen suits you best.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_6,If I were to transfer to Mighty Tools...
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_7,Just imagine all the electronics that would be destroyed in one month.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_8,I think there are other things that I should be doing.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_9,I also think the same.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_10,"I performed admirably in terms of decorating Snowfield this time around, but it was incredibly frustrating being unable to utilize any electric tools."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_11,It seems to me that the northern base suits me best.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_19_12,Ludmilla and I have a conversation about DIY tasks.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_1,Christmas is a special day.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_2,"Some spend it busying themselves with activities,"
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_3,while others use it to rest.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_4,How do you usually spend Christmas?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_5,I often go out to Royal Road.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_6,I usually rest in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_7,Oh.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_8,I thought for sure you'd say something like relaxing in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_9,"Then again, rest is all well and good again, but it's also good to go out, since there are so many special things to see and do on Christmas."
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_10,Hahaha.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_11,You're starting to sound like an honest-to-goodness workaholic.
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_12,Is Andersen rubbing off on you?
d_counseling_ludmilla_winterowner_20_13,I have a conversation with Ludmilla about Christmas.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_2,"Pray tell,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_3,what dost thou believe is the reason behind my inability to best Dorothy?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_4,I believe it's due to a difference in experience.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_5,I believe it's due to a difference in skills.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_6,Oh ho!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_7,"A most salient point, My Lord."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_8,But even so...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_9,I shan't readily falter this way.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_10,"I shall one day surpass Dorothy in every conceivable metric, experience included."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_11,What?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_12,"A disparity in skills, thou sayest?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_13,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_14,"Henceforth, I shall embark upon my training with a vigor increased tenfold."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_01_15,"With an unwavering  determination, Scarlet presses on with her training until the sun stands high in the sky."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_2,Scarlet is meditating with her eyes closed.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_3,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_4,Wave your hand in front of her face.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_5,Throw a small branch at her.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_6,*Swish swish*
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_7,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_8,"Forsooth, what skylarking dost thou engage in?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_9,"Cease thy antics, for it disturbs my contemplation."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_10,*Tap*
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_11,Pssh.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_12,Didst thou truly reckon such tomfoolery would escape my notice?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_13,"Have another go, I insist."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_14,My mind's eye is all-seeing. I can catch anything.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_02_15,Scarlet and I spend a somewhat noisy meditation session together.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_2,"Prithee,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_3,when will thou allow an official duel between Lilith and I?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_4,"If I were to permit that, harm would befall you."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_5,Why don't you go ask her yourself?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_6,... Thou dost not mince words.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_7,"However, the length and brevity of the matter shall only be revealed when the clash unfolds."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_8,And I have been far from languorous with my training.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_9,Dost thou not think there's at least an infinitesimal chance of me securing victory?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_10,I have returned henceforth from just positing this inquiry to her.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_11,She informed me that she required your permission.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_12,And you tell me I must go and ask her again?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_13,... Very well.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_14,I shall comply.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_03_15,"That day, Scarlet's request for a duel was turned down by Lilith numerous times."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_2,Why doth Red Hood love meddling in the affairs of others?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_3,"She perambulates tirelessly, putting her finger in every pie,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_4,yet shows no hint of weariness.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_5,Is it because she's my daughter?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_6,It's just her nature.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_7,...!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_8,"Verily, thou dost speak the truth?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_9,"I harbored suspicions, aye, but dared not conceive it to be true."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_10,"Finally, her penchant for meddling makes sense."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_11,I was just joking...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_12,...!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_13,Hath her nature been thus from the outset?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_14,Most intriguing...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_15,I'm afraid I don't have anyone in my immediate circle who shares such predilections.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_16,Oh.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_17,Methinks I am talking with one this very moment.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_04_18,Scarlet continues to voice her grievances about Red Hood for a while.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_2,Rapunzel always has that book around her without cease.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_3,"Its contents still elude me, but whenever she gazes upon its pages, merriment always fill her heart."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_4,Dost thou have any idea why this is?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_5,"Of course, I do."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_6,I'm not sure. You should ask her.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_7,*Swish*
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_8,"Oh, is this the book in question?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_9,"Could thou show me, perchance?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_10,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_11,Oh my...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_12,I had no clue this martial arts style even existed. How fascinating.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_13,I have already done so.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_14,She flushed crimson and hastily departed.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_15,"From the fleeting glimpse I did manage to catch,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_16,the content seemed to pertain to some kind of physical martial arts.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_17,I had no idea Rapunzel had an interest in such matters.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_05_18,"Scarlet thinks about searching for books on the ""martial arts""."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_2,*Pour*
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_3,Would thou care to have some?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_4,It's floral tea.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_5,"Thanks, I'd love a cup."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_6,When did you decide to share the same hobby as Dorothy?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_7,I personally roasted and brewed this tea.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_8,"The aroma and taste are positively opulent,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_9,quite distinct from whatever Dorothy fancies in her cup.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_10,What poppycock!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_11,This is no hobby.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_12,This is but a pursuit in maintaining good health.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_13,"Besides, the tea that Dorothy brews is sorely lacking in terms of flavor."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_14,One must properly roast and steep the tea leaves for a greater depth of flavor.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_06_15,Scarlet returns to her room and roasts the dried flowers she gathered.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_2,"When mine eyes set upon Snow White,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_3,there are times when I see myself in her.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_4,Because she's stubborn?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_5,Because of her youth?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_6,"... Her stubborn side, you say."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_7,"When it comes to stubbornness, aren't there other members who are worse?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_8,"From my understanding, Dorothy, Red Hood, and Lilith are pretty stubborn too."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_9,"... Yes, thou speakest the truth."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_10,There was a time when I too was young.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_11,"Those days, however, are long gone..."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_12,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_07_13,"That evening, Scarlet stayed up all night thinking of her sister."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_2,"In the art of angling,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_3,what virtue dost thou deem most important?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_4,Patience.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_5,A sturdy fishing rod.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_6,...!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_7,"Aye, thou hast hit the mark straightaway! 'Tis a marvel, indeed."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_8,It's good to have you back.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_9,That is of nugatory importance.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_10,"There exist a saying that for a master, the tools matter not."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_11,"With steadfast resolve, even the thinnest of twigs may transform into a mighty fishing rod."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_12,"Ruminate upon it further, my friend, and give me another answer later."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_08_13,"On her way back, Scarlet catches a big fish."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_2,The Goddess Squad is quite a curio.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_3,"A motley group of individuals, each adorned with unique personalities and appearances."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_4,"And yet, there is a remarkable sense of bonhomie amongst everyone here."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_5,You talk as if you're not part of the squad yourself.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_6,Could it be because you have a trustworthy leader?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_7,...!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_8,I do realize that.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_9,Nevertheless...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_10,"I daresay, I haven't quite woven myself seamlessly into the squad just yet."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_11,Yes... that's how I feel...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_12,??
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_13,"Ah, you are speaking of Lilith."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_14,She is indeed a trustworthy individual.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_15,... Hmm?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_16,"Pray tell, why dost thou bear such a discontented visage?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_09_17,"As Scarlet heads back to her room, she still cannot process the fact that she is truly part of the Goddess Squad."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_2,"Do tell, are you proficient at organizing?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_3,"Yeah, I think I'm pretty good at it."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_4,"No, I'm not."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_5,... Truly?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_6,I do not recall thy immediate purlieu in a particularly pristine disposition.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_7,"Then again,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_8,everyone has their own standards.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_9,You very well may hold yourself to your own.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_10,"Just as well, I say."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_11,I fail to see the necessity for
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_12,unending organization on a daily basis.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_13,"Should thou be able to locate what one needs when one needs it, what more can one desire?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_14,I simply cannot comprehend it.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_10_15,Scarlet pretends not to hear Dorothy and Lilith telling her to organize her room.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_2,Scarlet gazes at the roses blooming in the field.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_3,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_4,Don't you think the roses are beautiful?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_5,Do you fancy one? Shall I pluck one for you?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_6,Dost thou feel similarly?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_7,Mine own thoughts mirror thine.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_8,"Truly, their beauty is rapturous."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_9,'Tis enough to bring a tear to one's eyes.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_10,Absolutely not.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_11,Dost thou grasp the folly of thy actions? 'Tis a terrible thing to mar a flower so.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_12,Flowers are at the apogee of their beauty when thou simply observe them quietly.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_11_13,Scarlet continues to gaze at the roses for a while.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_2,Many a soul chooses to imbibe grog for
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_3,its calming effects on the mind.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_4,"Pray tell, dost thou revel in the joy of drink?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_5,I can't even get a good night's sleep without a nighttime drink.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_6,I don't understand the appeal spirits have for some people.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_7,Forsooth!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_8,I did not realize you were so partial to spirits.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_9,Thou and I share the same thoughts on this matter.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_10,I cannot fathom why some people choose to
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_11,indulge in spirits to such a degree.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_12_12,Scarlet fondly recalls the scent of the rose-infused liquor she used to enjoy.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_2,Lilith does not merely vanquish Raptures.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_3,She tears them limb from limb.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_4,I long to tear apart a Rapture...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_5,... I don't think it's possible for you.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_6,You can do it!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_7,"Hah, what tomfoolery! Jumping to conclusion when I've not even finished my piece."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_8,"Mark my words, My Lord. The day will soon come to pass when I tear a Rapture asunder."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_9,The mere act of your skepticism riles up my competitive spirit.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_11,I shan't feel the slightest trace of sincerity in your cheer.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_13_12,Scarlet renewed her determination to become as strong as Lilith.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_2,I require a partner for my training this day.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_3,Will thou lend me a hand?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_4,All I require is for thee to hold the object which I will be slicing.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_5,What if you cut me by accident?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_6,Oh boy!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_7,How dare thou!
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_8,What manner of a fool dost thou take me for?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_9,I have never injured anyone unless I meant to.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_10,...?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_11,What kind of reaction is that?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_12,I'm so excited to get an opportunity to see you train up close.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_13,I certainly did not expect thee to be in such a state of near ecstasy.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_14,"Very well, let's train."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_14_15,Scarlet trains with a bit more concentration than usual.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_2,Snow White and Lilith are akin to two peas in a pod.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_3,Some people even mistake them for sisters.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_4,... That must be nice.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_5,What about having a brother instead?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_6,Why don't you ask if you can join them?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_7,... I presume thou are referring to thee and I?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_8,"Thank thee, but I must decline."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_9,I would much prefer to have a sister.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_10,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_11,If such a thing were truly feasible...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_12,"Oh, how wondrous it would be."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_15_13,Scarlet closes her eyes and thinks of a certain someone.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_2,"Pray tell,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_3,dost thou believe I am strong?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_4,Yeah.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_5,"Yes, but not as strong as me."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_6,Thine answer came with nary a hesitation.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_7,Because your strength is so formidable.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_8,"Is that so... well, many thanks for thy candor."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_9,Hmm?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_10,"Dost thou speak the truth, verily?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_11,"Such is my shock, that I am at a loss for words."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_16_12,Scarlet ponders different ways in which she can become even stronger.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_2,I held counsel with Rapunzel today about the joy of using one's body.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_3,So... were you able to have a civil conversation about that?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_4,What did you talk about?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_5,I never anticipated finding myself in such a conversation with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_6,"However, she is more adept in the delight of using the corporeal form than I had envisaged."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_7,"Most indubitably, I was rather taken aback."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_8,Our conversation spanned numerous topics.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_9,"How thou can use thy body to feel good,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_10,and how to use it more aptly.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_11,It was indeed a rare moment to partake in such an enlightening conversation.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_17_12,Scarlet recalls her talk with Rapunzel.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_2,I have but a question for thee.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_3,Dost thou consider us close?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_4,"Of course, we're family."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_5,"Our relationship is mostly professional, don't you think?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_6,"... Family, huh?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_7,Not bad.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_8,... Is that truly so?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_9,... I'm just kidding.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_10,...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_11,"Honestly, it was all just a joke."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_12,"... Very well, I understand."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_18_13,Scarlet takes some time to mull over her various interpersonal relationships.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_2,"When thou pines for someone,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_3,what course of action dost thou pursue?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_4,The only thing I can do is miss them.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_5,I'll cry.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_6,"Verily, thou dost not flee from the emotions thou feel when missing that person?"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_7,"No. This way, the pain of missing them will lessen with time."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_8,... I see. That makes sense.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_9,Cry? Whatever for?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_10,"If you cry yourself to sleep, then you can forget about how much it hurts missing them."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_11,... I see.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_12,But I shan't wish to shed tears.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_19_13,Scarlet falls into a state of contemplation.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_1,"Scarlet closes her eyes and recalls the past, which has become a blur."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_2,"If thou were to cast off this mortal coil tomorrow's eve,"
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_3,what would thou do?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_4,I would spend time with the people that are precious to me.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_5,I would spend some quiet time alone.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_6,"Verily, nothing holds a greater meaning than this."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_7,"Aye, that thought did grace my mind as well."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_8,I would spend my time telling them all the things I have kept inside me for so long.
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_10,To be lone in one's final moments... would that not be a most forlorn demise?
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_11,"Were it me, I'd revel in the company of those dear to me."
d_counseling_hongryeon_blackshadow_20_12,Scarlet seems to be preoccupied with mortality.
d_counseling_leona_01_1,"Cats go ""meow meow"","
d_counseling_leona_01_2,"dogs go, ""woof woof"","
d_counseling_leona_01_3,and Timi goes...
d_counseling_leona_01_4,Rowl Rowl!
d_counseling_leona_01_5,Graul!
d_counseling_leona_01_6,No no no!
d_counseling_leona_01_7,That's the sound of a tiger.
d_counseling_leona_01_8,"I'm a little disappointed in you, Zoo Keeper."
d_counseling_leona_01_9,Yeah!
d_counseling_leona_01_10,You're right!
d_counseling_leona_01_11,"Some people think he goes ""Rowl rowl"","
d_counseling_leona_01_12,"but that's the roar of a tiger, not a lion."
d_counseling_leona_01_13,I have a conversation with Leona about Timi's roar.
d_counseling_leona_02_1,"It really eats me up inside how so many people are scared of Timi, just because he's a lion."
d_counseling_leona_02_2,Especially when he's as cute as he is.
d_counseling_leona_02_3,What do you think I can do to make people realize how charming he can be?
d_counseling_leona_02_4,Promote the shelter volunteer program more heavily.
d_counseling_leona_02_5,Make him wear a dog mask.
d_counseling_leona_02_6,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_leona_02_7,"That way, more people will come to the shelter and get to see Timi for who he really is."
d_counseling_leona_02_8,"Once they realize how awesome he is, they're sure to spread the word."
d_counseling_leona_02_9,"Thanks for the suggestion, Zoo Keeper."
d_counseling_leona_02_10,"No, we can't do that."
d_counseling_leona_02_11,Timi's face is integral to his charm.
d_counseling_leona_02_12,We can't cover that up!
d_counseling_leona_02_13,I have a conversation with Leona about Timi's charm.
d_counseling_leona_03_1,"Maybe it's just me, but Biscuit seems a bit scared of me sometimes."
d_counseling_leona_03_2,Am I really that intimidating?
d_counseling_leona_03_3,"It's not you, but rather the animals that you always have around you."
d_counseling_leona_03_4,It can be a tad bit hard approaching you.
d_counseling_leona_03_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_leona_03_6,I guess that's a fair point.
d_counseling_leona_03_7,Big animals can be kinda freaky to some people.
d_counseling_leona_03_8,What?
d_counseling_leona_03_9,Really?
d_counseling_leona_03_10,I always thought I was pretty friendly...
d_counseling_leona_03_11,Then what can I do to make Biscuit feel more comfortable?
d_counseling_leona_03_12,I have a short conversation with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_04_1,Did you know
d_counseling_leona_04_2,there used to be these places called zoos?
d_counseling_leona_04_3,"Animals were kept there, and people paid money to go see them."
d_counseling_leona_04_4,Sounds like a lot of fun.
d_counseling_leona_04_5,I feel sorry for the animals.
d_counseling_leona_04_6,You think so?
d_counseling_leona_04_7,I doubt the animals found it all that fun.
d_counseling_leona_04_8,Becoming spectacles for humans all while being confined in tight spaces.
d_counseling_leona_04_9,I'm glad you feel that way too.
d_counseling_leona_04_10,None of those animals ever had a choice. They were forcibly confined and displayed as a spectacle.
d_counseling_leona_04_11,It must have been miserable.
d_counseling_leona_04_12,I'm glad such a thing doesn't exist anymore.
d_counseling_leona_04_13,Leona and I talk more about zoos.
d_counseling_leona_05_1,Biscuit likes kibble.
d_counseling_leona_05_2,Nero likes kitty treats.
d_counseling_leona_05_3,Do you remember what I like?
d_counseling_leona_05_4,Meat.
d_counseling_leona_05_5,Vegetables.
d_counseling_leona_05_6,Bingo!
d_counseling_leona_05_7,Meat is my favorite.
d_counseling_leona_05_8,"Especially when it's cooked blue, lightly seared on the outside, and red on the inside."
d_counseling_leona_05_9,Huh?
d_counseling_leona_05_10,I can't stand vegetables.
d_counseling_leona_05_11,I much prefer meat. There's much more to it.
d_counseling_leona_05_12,All this talk of food is making me hungry.
d_counseling_leona_05_13,Do you want to go eat together later?
d_counseling_leona_05_14,I listen to Leona as she continues to extol the virtues of meat.
d_counseling_leona_06_1,"People often think that cats are the only ones that are lazy and loaf around all the time,"
d_counseling_leona_06_2,but lions are actually quite similar.
d_counseling_leona_06_3,They're always lying down and rolling around.
d_counseling_leona_06_4,G-grrr...?
d_counseling_leona_06_5,"They are a member of the cat family, after all."
d_counseling_leona_06_6,Cats and lions have a lot in common. More than people think.
d_counseling_leona_06_7,Wow!
d_counseling_leona_06_8,You knew that already?
d_counseling_leona_06_9,You're more interested in animals than I thought you were.
d_counseling_leona_06_10,That makes me really happy!
d_counseling_leona_06_11,Precisely.
d_counseling_leona_06_12,They've also got rough tongues
d_counseling_leona_06_13,and have retractable claws.
d_counseling_leona_06_14,"If you're interested, I've got plenty more factoids I could share with you."
d_counseling_leona_06_15,I have a conversation with Leona about animals.
d_counseling_leona_07_1,Timi has been shedding like crazy lately.
d_counseling_leona_07_2,I could probably knit a blanket with all the fur he's lost.
d_counseling_leona_07_3,You should brush Timi every day.
d_counseling_leona_07_4,"It's shedding season, so these things are inevitable."
d_counseling_leona_07_5,Are you insinuating that I don't already do that?
d_counseling_leona_07_6,"Zoo Keeper, that's mean."
d_counseling_leona_07_7,Where do you think Timi's beautiful coat gets its luster?
d_counseling_leona_07_8,I take great care to brush it every day.
d_counseling_leona_07_9,"During the shedding season, it doesn't matter how often you brush them. They just keep shedding."
d_counseling_leona_07_10,"You're right. No matter how much I brush him, it doesn't seem to make any difference."
d_counseling_leona_07_11,It takes me over an hour to remove all the strands of hair off my clothes.
d_counseling_leona_07_12,"Anyway, I'm impressed you knew about seasonal shedding."
d_counseling_leona_07_13,Are you sure you don't want to volunteer at the animal shelter?
d_counseling_leona_07_14,I have a discussion with Leona about Timi's shedding.
d_counseling_leona_08_1,Have you ever touched Timi's paws?
d_counseling_leona_08_2,They're so soft and squishy.
d_counseling_leona_08_3,Would you like to try?
d_counseling_leona_08_4,Poke Timi's paw.
d_counseling_leona_08_5,Poke Leona's side.
d_counseling_leona_08_6,*Poke*
d_counseling_leona_08_7,Graul?
d_counseling_leona_08_8,Don't they feel lovely?
d_counseling_leona_08_9,"So squishy, hehe."
d_counseling_leona_08_10,*Poke*
d_counseling_leona_08_11,Hey!
d_counseling_leona_08_12,You startled me.
d_counseling_leona_08_13,What are you poking me for? I was talking about touching Timi's paw.
d_counseling_leona_08_14,I spend time with Leona while poking Timi's paws.
d_counseling_leona_09_1,Graul! Graul!
d_counseling_leona_09_2,"Yeah, yeah! I feel the same way."
d_counseling_leona_09_3,Graul.
d_counseling_leona_09_4,"No, that's not it."
d_counseling_leona_09_5,"What are you looking at me like that for, Zoo Keeper?"
d_counseling_leona_09_6,Because you're so beautiful.
d_counseling_leona_09_7,It's fascinating that you can communicate with Timi like that.
d_counseling_leona_09_8,??
d_counseling_leona_09_9,"Haha, I can tell that's not the real reason,"
d_counseling_leona_09_10,but I'm happy hearing you saying that anyway.
d_counseling_leona_09_11,Thanks.
d_counseling_leona_09_12,I find it interesting myself.
d_counseling_leona_09_13,I've always been able to tell what animals were saying.
d_counseling_leona_09_14,I wonder why other people are incapable of it?
d_counseling_leona_09_15,I have an enjoyable time with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_10_1,"Zoo Keeper, let me give you a quiz."
d_counseling_leona_10_2,How many teeth does an adult lion have?
d_counseling_leona_10_3,Around 20.
d_counseling_leona_10_4,Around 30.
d_counseling_leona_10_5,"Come on,"
d_counseling_leona_10_6,how could such a big cat only have 20 teeth?
d_counseling_leona_10_7,I'm disappointed in you.
d_counseling_leona_10_8,They usually tend to have about 30.
d_counseling_leona_10_9,Correct!
d_counseling_leona_10_10,"Honestly, Zoo Keeper, with your level of knowledge, I think I'd feel safe even entrusting Timi in your care."
d_counseling_leona_10_11,You're practically an animal expert.
d_counseling_leona_10_12,Leona and I spend some time counting Timi's teeth.
d_counseling_leona_11_1,"There were three bears in one house. Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear."
d_counseling_leona_11_2,You know what I've always found fascinating?
d_counseling_leona_11_3,"Bears can be such ferocious creatures, but they're oftentimes viewed as cute and cuddly."
d_counseling_leona_11_4,I think we have teddy bears to thank for that.
d_counseling_leona_11_5,That's because bears are cute.
d_counseling_leona_11_6,"Maybe so, especially if that's the first image of bears you're exposed to when you're young."
d_counseling_leona_11_7,Do you think people would find other animals less frightening if they were made into dolls?
d_counseling_leona_11_8,Wow!
d_counseling_leona_11_9,"Do you really think so, Zoo Keeper?"
d_counseling_leona_11_10,You've got a keen eye.
d_counseling_leona_11_11,"Bears, lions, and other big animals are super cute when you see them up close."
d_counseling_leona_11_12,I hope other people will be able to appreciate how cute these big fellas can be.
d_counseling_leona_11_13,I have a conversation with Leona about cute animals.
d_counseling_leona_12_1,"Have you heard of the saying, ""The bigger they are, the cuter they are.""?"
d_counseling_leona_12_2,"Some students came to volunteer at the shelter, and I overheard one of them say that about Timi."
d_counseling_leona_12_3,"I think that saying could apply to you as well, Leona."
d_counseling_leona_12_4,"So by that rationale, the smaller something is, the less cute it is?"
d_counseling_leona_12_5,Huh?
d_counseling_leona_12_6,So I'm big in what sense?
d_counseling_leona_12_7,As in my height? Or...
d_counseling_leona_12_8,"Anyway, I'll take it as a compliment. Thank you, Zoo Keeper."
d_counseling_leona_12_9,"Oh, I didn't mean it like that."
d_counseling_leona_12_10,You would be unpopular if you spoke in this way.
d_counseling_leona_12_11,"Haha, there's no need to sulk."
d_counseling_leona_12_12,"In my eyes, you're as cute as can be."
d_counseling_leona_12_13,Leona and I have an enjoyable time.
d_counseling_leona_13_1,"Although I'm a Nikke, I do fall prey to my own emotions sometimes."
d_counseling_leona_13_2,Mostly feelings of exhaustion.
d_counseling_leona_13_3,What should I do to get over that?
d_counseling_leona_13_4,Talk to me whenever you're feeling tired.
d_counseling_leona_13_5,Try talking to Biscuit or Nero.
d_counseling_leona_13_6,"I knew you would be someone I could depend on,"
d_counseling_leona_13_7,Zoo Keeper.
d_counseling_leona_13_8,"All right, when things get tough, I'll be sure to talk to you."
d_counseling_leona_13_9,"I'd like to do that,"
d_counseling_leona_13_10,"but I'm their leader, so I don't want to show any weakness."
d_counseling_leona_13_11,"I'll try to tough it out, and when I feel I can't, I'll talk to you."
d_counseling_leona_13_12,Is that okay?
d_counseling_leona_13_13,I have a meaningful time with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_14_1,"When people say that someone has the heart of a lion,"
d_counseling_leona_14_2,it means that they're a determined and courageous person.
d_counseling_leona_14_3,Do you know anyone like that?
d_counseling_leona_14_4,Me.
d_counseling_leona_14_5,You.
d_counseling_leona_14_6,"Haha, I don't disagree,"
d_counseling_leona_14_7,"but it's a bit strange to nominate yourself, you know."
d_counseling_leona_14_8,"Then again, even doing that takes a bit of courage, so I suppose it's admirable."
d_counseling_leona_14_9,"I'm glad you see me that way, but"
d_counseling_leona_14_10,there are many things that I still lack.
d_counseling_leona_14_11,"Personally, I feel that you're the one with the heart of a lion."
d_counseling_leona_14_12,I have a meaningful time with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_15_1,I've been wondering:
d_counseling_leona_15_2,"When you grill meat, how do you like to cook it?"
d_counseling_leona_15_3,Rare.
d_counseling_leona_15_4,Medium.
d_counseling_leona_15_5,Me too!
d_counseling_leona_15_6,Have you heard of blue steak?
d_counseling_leona_15_7,It's when you lightly sear the outside and that's all.
d_counseling_leona_15_8,"Personally, I prefer my meat rare or blue."
d_counseling_leona_15_9,I guess we're pretty similar in how we like our meat cooked.
d_counseling_leona_15_10,"Okay, so you like it somewhat cooked."
d_counseling_leona_15_11,"Personally, I prefer it as raw as possible, so rare is as high as I'll go."
d_counseling_leona_15_12,I guess we're a bit different in how we like our meat cooked.
d_counseling_leona_15_13,I have a discussion with Leona about cooking.
d_counseling_leona_16_1,Do you think it's possible to raise big animals as household pets?
d_counseling_leona_16_2,"Living together in the same space, going out on walks, giving them treats, and all that."
d_counseling_leona_16_3,I think it would be hard.
d_counseling_leona_16_4,I think it's certainly possible.
d_counseling_leona_16_5,It certainly would be.
d_counseling_leona_16_6,"Even with a domesticated species like dogs, there are certain species which are less tame and require special attention."
d_counseling_leona_16_7,Raising wild animals to be a household pet would be an even greater challenge.
d_counseling_leona_16_8,"It's not completely impossible, but it's far too dangerous."
d_counseling_leona_16_9,I disagree.
d_counseling_leona_16_10,These are wild animals we're talking about here.
d_counseling_leona_16_11,The only reason the guys in the shelter are as docile as they are is because they've been trained by me.
d_counseling_leona_16_12,They're usually far more ferocious and dangerous creatures.
d_counseling_leona_16_13,Leona and I have a conversation about how to care for big animals.
d_counseling_leona_17_1,"There's a saying, ""A lion always hunts to the hilt, even when trying to catch a rabbit."""
d_counseling_leona_17_2,What's your takeaway from that?
d_counseling_leona_17_3,"That you should try your best, no matter if the task is big or small."
d_counseling_leona_17_4,Surviving in the wild isn't easy.
d_counseling_leona_17_5,A fairly cookie-cutter answer.
d_counseling_leona_17_6,But did you know?
d_counseling_leona_17_7,Rabbits are faster than you think.
d_counseling_leona_17_8,"For a lion, catching a rabbit isn't as easy as you may imagine."
d_counseling_leona_17_9,!!
d_counseling_leona_17_10,You're the first person to tell me that.
d_counseling_leona_17_11,"In the unforgiving environment that is nature, you have to give your utmost to every hunt, regardless of the size of the prey."
d_counseling_leona_17_12,"On top of that, rabbits can run much faster than you might think."
d_counseling_leona_17_13,"I appreciate you sharing your thoughts with me, Zoo Keeper."
d_counseling_leona_17_14,I have an enjoyable time with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_18_1,Look at this!
d_counseling_leona_18_2,I bought a scarf from the store.
d_counseling_leona_18_3,Did you buy it for Timi?
d_counseling_leona_18_4,Did you buy it for me?
d_counseling_leona_18_5,That's right.
d_counseling_leona_18_6,"I think Timi may be coming down with a cold,"
d_counseling_leona_18_7,so that's why I bought this for him.
d_counseling_leona_18_8,It's all the more convenient since a regular human-sized scarf is the perfect size for him.
d_counseling_leona_18_9,"Er... no, this is for Timi."
d_counseling_leona_18_10,I can see how you would have gotten that impression though.
d_counseling_leona_18_11,Timi is big enough so that I can buy a regular scarf meant for humans.
d_counseling_leona_18_12,Sorry if I got your hopes up...
d_counseling_leona_18_13,I spend some time with Leona talking about just how large Timi is.
d_counseling_leona_19_1,Ouch!
d_counseling_leona_19_2,"Don't bite, Timi."
d_counseling_leona_19_3,Timi chews lightly on Leona's head.
d_counseling_leona_19_4,"Don't your teeth hurt, Timi?"
d_counseling_leona_19_5,"Doesn't your head hurt, Leona?"
d_counseling_leona_19_6,Graul?
d_counseling_leona_19_7,Wait a minute.
d_counseling_leona_19_8,Are you saying that my head is harder than Timi's teeth?
d_counseling_leona_19_9,"I mean... that's true, but still, it's not exactly flattering to hear."
d_counseling_leona_19_10,I'm okay.
d_counseling_leona_19_11,My head is pretty sturdy.
d_counseling_leona_19_12,"Timi knows that too, which is why he's comfortable doing this."
d_counseling_leona_19_13,I'm just worried that it might become a habit of his.
d_counseling_leona_19_14,I have an enjoyable time with Leona.
d_counseling_leona_20_1,"Boy, am I full."
d_counseling_leona_20_2,I just wanna roll around and doze off.
d_counseling_leona_20_3,Graul.
d_counseling_leona_20_4,Would you like to sleep in the Commander's Room?
d_counseling_leona_20_5,I can wrap up our session early so you can go back and get some sleep.
d_counseling_leona_20_6,Can I?
d_counseling_leona_20_7,"If you're sure it's okay, I'll borrow your bed for a moment."
d_counseling_leona_20_8,Are you sure that's okay?
d_counseling_leona_20_9,I'd really like to lie down.
d_counseling_leona_20_10,Is there any chance I can take a nap in the Commander's Room?
d_counseling_leona_20_11,Graul.
d_counseling_leona_20_12,Leona and Timi lie on the bed and fall asleep.
d_counseling_moran_01_1,"Cadet,"
d_counseling_moran_01_2,I'll protect you no matter what happens.
d_counseling_moran_01_3,You're the best.
d_counseling_moran_01_4,Shouldn't it be the other way around?
d_counseling_moran_01_5,"If you're ever feeling threatened,"
d_counseling_moran_01_6,be sure to let me know.
d_counseling_moran_01_7,Okay?
d_counseling_moran_01_8,"Oooh, that sounds pretty cool."
d_counseling_moran_01_9,I appreciate you saying that.
d_counseling_moran_01_10,I have a meaningful conversation with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_02_1,Cadet.
d_counseling_moran_02_2,What do you value most in life?
d_counseling_moran_02_3,Loyalty.
d_counseling_moran_02_4,Money.
d_counseling_moran_02_5,Me as well.
d_counseling_moran_02_6,A life without loyalty is a fate worse than death.
d_counseling_moran_02_7,"Sure, money is important,"
d_counseling_moran_02_8,but I think loyalty matters more.
d_counseling_moran_02_9,A merchant's fidelity is of paramount importance when sealing the deal.
d_counseling_moran_02_10,I talk with Moran about loyalty.
d_counseling_moran_03_1,Sakura and Rosanna
d_counseling_moran_03_2,haven't been answering my calls recently.
d_counseling_moran_03_3,"I must have called them a dozen times, and they haven't responded once."
d_counseling_moran_03_4,Maybe they're busy.
d_counseling_moran_03_5,Could they have blocked you?
d_counseling_moran_03_6,I've considered that.
d_counseling_moran_03_7,"After all, they are busier than me..."
d_counseling_moran_03_8,I was just paranoid that they had blocked me or something.
d_counseling_moran_03_9,!!
d_counseling_moran_03_10,You really think they'd do such a thing?
d_counseling_moran_03_11,They threatened to block me if I kept spamming them with phone calls...
d_counseling_moran_03_12,But I didn't think they'd actually do it.
d_counseling_moran_03_13,I call Rosanna and Sakura myself to confirm.
d_counseling_moran_04_1,"I wish I had a signature gesture or something,"
d_counseling_moran_04_2,whenever I'm extolling the virtues of loyalty.
d_counseling_moran_04_3,Do you have any recommendations?
d_counseling_moran_04_4,Try a fist bump.
d_counseling_moran_04_5,Try lifting both arms in the air and cheering.
d_counseling_moran_04_6,A fist bump?
d_counseling_moran_04_7,Are you sure that wouldn't cause someone to get aggressive?
d_counseling_moran_04_8,"Okay, I like it."
d_counseling_moran_04_9,That should work nicely.
d_counseling_moran_04_10,"All right, I'll do that next time I'm praising loyalty to the heavens."
d_counseling_moran_04_11,Would you like to try it out with me?
d_counseling_moran_04_12,"During our session, Moran and I try out some potential signature gestures for her."
d_counseling_moran_05_1,Rosanna always accuses me of being ignorant.
d_counseling_moran_05_2,"You don't think that, do you, Cadet?"
d_counseling_moran_05_3,I'd say you're more innocent than ignorant.
d_counseling_moran_05_4,"No, you're smart as a whip."
d_counseling_moran_05_5,Innocent?
d_counseling_moran_05_6,Being too innocent is tantamount to being naïve...
d_counseling_moran_05_7,"Nevertheless, I'll take that as a compliment."
d_counseling_moran_05_8,...
d_counseling_moran_05_9,"You don't need to blow smoke up my behind, Cadet."
d_counseling_moran_05_10,I'd rather you told it to me straight.
d_counseling_moran_05_11,Lying is the ultimate way to corrode trust.
d_counseling_moran_05_12,I have a meaningful conversation with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_06_1,"My heart races whenever I look at you, Cadet."
d_counseling_moran_06_2,"I'm not sick, am I?"
d_counseling_moran_06_3,"You like me, don't you?"
d_counseling_moran_06_4,You might have chronic heart disease.
d_counseling_moran_06_5,"Sure, you're great!"
d_counseling_moran_06_6,...!
d_counseling_moran_06_7,Cadet... I... I think I know why my heart races!
d_counseling_moran_06_8,What?
d_counseling_moran_06_9,Of course I don't!
d_counseling_moran_06_10,"... But just in case, maybe I should go to the hospital for a physical."
d_counseling_moran_06_11,I have a meaningful conversation with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_07_1,Jin asked me if I was going on a date today.
d_counseling_moran_07_2,Have you ever been on a date?
d_counseling_moran_07_3,We can go on one together after this session.
d_counseling_moran_07_4,I'm going on one once our session is finished.
d_counseling_moran_07_5,You and me?
d_counseling_moran_07_6,Th-that'd be great!
d_counseling_moran_07_7,But where should we go? What should we do?
d_counseling_moran_07_8,This'll be my first date...
d_counseling_moran_07_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_moran_07_10,You can leave early if you need to.
d_counseling_moran_07_11,But... could I tag along?
d_counseling_moran_07_12,Moran and I talk about dates.
d_counseling_moran_08_1,"Cadet,"
d_counseling_moran_08_2,what do you usually do when you're sad?
d_counseling_moran_08_3,Cry until the sadness disappears.
d_counseling_moran_08_4,What makes you ask? Are you feeling sad?
d_counseling_moran_08_5,Does crying help?
d_counseling_moran_08_6,... But I don't want you to see me cry.
d_counseling_moran_08_7,Yeah...
d_counseling_moran_08_8,"One of the Peony Association members got injured during a mission, pretty badly too."
d_counseling_moran_08_9,So I'm feeling kind of down.
d_counseling_moran_08_10,I comfort Moran for a while.
d_counseling_moran_09_1,"Hey, Cadet."
d_counseling_moran_09_2,I brought you some peonies.
d_counseling_moran_09_3,I thought they might look nice in your room.
d_counseling_moran_09_4,It'll be like having a piece of you in my room every day.
d_counseling_moran_09_5,Peonies are my favorite flower.
d_counseling_moran_09_6,Huh? I'm not sure I understand.
d_counseling_moran_09_7,Why should we have to be together every day?
d_counseling_moran_09_8,Really?!
d_counseling_moran_09_9,That's great.
d_counseling_moran_09_10,I'm a big fan of peonies as well.
d_counseling_moran_09_11,"After these wilt, I'll bring you some fresh ones."
d_counseling_moran_09_12,Moran and I talk about peony flowers.
d_counseling_moran_10_1,"The Peony Association members have been on their best behavior as of late,"
d_counseling_moran_10_2,so I want to do something special for them.
d_counseling_moran_10_3,Do you have suggestions?
d_counseling_moran_10_4,Write each of them a handwritten letter.
d_counseling_moran_10_5,Arrange a get-together for the squad.
d_counseling_moran_10_6,Letters?
d_counseling_moran_10_7,Hmm... I'll think about it.
d_counseling_moran_10_8,"That means I'd have to write about a dozen of them, though..."
d_counseling_moran_10_9,It would be nice for all of us to have a big meal together.
d_counseling_moran_10_10,We could chow down on some good grub.
d_counseling_moran_10_11,"You should come as well, Cadet."
d_counseling_moran_10_12,I have a meaningful conversation with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_11_1,"Cadet,"
d_counseling_moran_11_2,"when it comes to girls, do you have a type?"
d_counseling_moran_11_3,Someone who's cheerful.
d_counseling_moran_11_4,Someone who's charming.
d_counseling_moran_11_5,I prefer someone who's peppy and bubbly as well.
d_counseling_moran_11_6,Being around people like that gives you a real energy boost.
d_counseling_moran_11_7,"Sounds like you and I are kindred spirits, Cadet!"
d_counseling_moran_11_8,Charming?
d_counseling_moran_11_9,...
d_counseling_moran_11_10,Would you say that
d_counseling_moran_11_11,I'm charming?
d_counseling_moran_11_12,I talk with Moran about my ideal type of girl.
d_counseling_moran_12_1,I'm late for my session with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_12_2,...
d_counseling_moran_12_3,"As I enter the Commander's Room huffing and puffing, Moran doesn't seem to notice my presence."
d_counseling_moran_12_4,Got something on your mind?
d_counseling_moran_12_5,...
d_counseling_moran_12_6,"Oh, hi Cadet."
d_counseling_moran_12_7,I didn't hear you come in.
d_counseling_moran_12_8,"In fact, something has been bugging me, and I was hoping you could help me."
d_counseling_moran_12_9,Gah! You scared me!
d_counseling_moran_12_10,I didn't hear you come in. You should have announced your presence!
d_counseling_moran_12_11,Now I forgot what I wanted to say...
d_counseling_moran_12_12,I have a meaningful conversation with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_13_1,Cadet!
d_counseling_moran_13_2,Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!
d_counseling_moran_13_3,... Loyalty.
d_counseling_moran_13_4,Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!
d_counseling_moran_13_5,"C'mon, louder!"
d_counseling_moran_13_6,Say it like you mean it!
d_counseling_moran_13_7,Yes! I knew you'd shout out with me!
d_counseling_moran_13_8,I feel so freakin' pumped right now!
d_counseling_moran_13_9,Moran and I bellow out chants all day long.
d_counseling_moran_14_1,"Cadet,"
d_counseling_moran_14_2,I think you're the most beautiful person I've ever known.
d_counseling_moran_14_3,Right back at you.
d_counseling_moran_14_4,I get that a lot.
d_counseling_moran_14_5,T-thanks!
d_counseling_moran_14_6,"Oh my goodness, I didn't expect you to be so candid..."
d_counseling_moran_14_7,"Is it just me, or is it hot in here? Could I crack open a window?"
d_counseling_moran_14_8,"Haha, I see."
d_counseling_moran_14_9,"But, you know... you didn't really respond to me..."
d_counseling_moran_14_10,Moran and I talk about physical appearances.
d_counseling_moran_15_1,I feel like all my money disappears the instant I close my eyes.
d_counseling_moran_15_2,It's like I've got a hole in my wallet.
d_counseling_moran_15_3,Is there any way you could teach me how to save money?
d_counseling_moran_15_4,I'm not really good at saving money myself.
d_counseling_moran_15_5,How about I manage your money for you?
d_counseling_moran_15_6,So I'm not the only one!
d_counseling_moran_15_7,That's a minor relief at least.
d_counseling_moran_15_8,Hmm? You?
d_counseling_moran_15_9,"Um... that's okay, thanks."
d_counseling_moran_15_10,Jin told me never to put your money in someone else's hands.
d_counseling_moran_15_11,Moran and I further discuss ways to potentially save up money.
d_counseling_moran_16_1,"Cadet,"
d_counseling_moran_16_2,what's your stance on white lies?
d_counseling_moran_16_3,I think they're necessary.
d_counseling_moran_16_4,I think they're just as bad as any other type of lie.
d_counseling_moran_16_5,Really?
d_counseling_moran_16_6,"Personally, I'm against them."
d_counseling_moran_16_7,"Even if they're uttered with good intentions, you're still earning someone's trust through deception."
d_counseling_moran_16_8,I think so too.
d_counseling_moran_16_9,"A lie is a lie, and that's that."
d_counseling_moran_16_10,I talk about white lies with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_17_1,Cadet!
d_counseling_moran_17_2,How do you like my sunglasses?
d_counseling_moran_17_3,Very cool.
d_counseling_moran_17_4,Where did you buy them? I want a pair.
d_counseling_moran_17_5,...
d_counseling_moran_17_6,Why do I feel like you're not being honest?
d_counseling_moran_17_7,Your response sounds so rehearsed.
d_counseling_moran_17_8,Are you a big fan of sunglasses too?
d_counseling_moran_17_9,How about we go shopping sometime?
d_counseling_moran_17_10,I talk about sunglasses with Moran.
d_counseling_moran_18_1,I'm in the mood for a drink.
d_counseling_moran_18_2,What kind of alcohol do you like?
d_counseling_moran_18_3,Cocktails that are on the sweet side.
d_counseling_moran_18_4,"Whiskey, neat."
d_counseling_moran_18_5,Wow!
d_counseling_moran_18_6,I love a good cocktail.
d_counseling_moran_18_7,What do you say we get ourselves a round?
d_counseling_moran_18_8,Hmm... whisky isn't really my favorite.
d_counseling_moran_18_9,You seem to be able to hold your liquor well.
d_counseling_moran_18_10,How do you feel about cocktails?
d_counseling_moran_18_11,Moran and I talk about alcoholic beverages.
d_counseling_moran_19_1,I always wonder what I would be
d_counseling_moran_19_2,if I weren't the head of the Peony Association.
d_counseling_moran_19_3,A gang member.
d_counseling_moran_19_4,A policewoman.
d_counseling_moran_19_5,What?
d_counseling_moran_19_6,There's nothing I despise more than hooligans!
d_counseling_moran_19_7,So that's what you see me as?
d_counseling_moran_19_8,A police officer?
d_counseling_moran_19_9,That's not bad.
d_counseling_moran_19_10,"It seems you have a favorable impression of me, eh?"
d_counseling_moran_19_11,We think about other jobs that would suit Moran.
d_counseling_moran_20_1,"I want Jin to see a few of the scraps that we get into with other gangs,"
d_counseling_moran_20_2,"but he always says his brain is his weapon of choice, not his brawn."
d_counseling_moran_20_3,You need to give him a proper reason to want to see a fight.
d_counseling_moran_20_4,Take him by force.
d_counseling_moran_20_5,It's just that he's way more eloquent than me. He'd probably talk circles around me.
d_counseling_moran_20_6,Could you help me come up with a good reason?
d_counseling_moran_20_7,I'd rather not.
d_counseling_moran_20_8,I like to avoid all unnecessary conflict.
d_counseling_moran_20_9,Isn't there any other way?
d_counseling_moran_20_10,Moran and I talk about Jin.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_2,what do you think of my outfit?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_3,It looks good on you.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_4,... But I feel like something's missing.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_5,R-really? Well... It's not like I specifically wore this for you...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_6,but I suppose I can wear it more often in the future.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_7,...!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_8,"I-it's not as if I dressed up in this to please you, so it doesn't matter."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_9,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_10,"... Anyway, what do you think is missing?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_01_11,Privaty and I talk about outfits.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_2,how many stars would you give my service?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_3,"Five stars, obviously."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_4,I dunno... One?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_5,I knew you'd say that!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_6,You know why?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_7,"Honestly, if it were you, I figured you'd be content with my service."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_8,...?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_9,"Wait, what? Just one?!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_10,W-why would you even say that?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_11,"I know I may be lacking, but I don't think I'm that bad!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_12,"So, what part of it did you not like? Just be honest with me!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_02_13,Privaty and I talk about her service.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_2,"if you had to pick someone to be your exclusive maid,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_3,would you rather have me or Drake?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_4,Drake.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_5,You.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_6,What?! Why?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_7,"Ah, well... Everyone has different tastes, right?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_8,"I guess I could, like, call Drake over here or something?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_9,Hehe.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_10,I knew you'd choose me!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_11,"Though becoming someone's exclusive maid isn't exactly my thing,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_12,"I suppose I can make an exception for you, Master."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_03_13,Privaty and I talk about what goes into being an exclusive maid.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_1,Ugh... This maid outfit is so uncomfortable.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_2,I can't wait to take it off.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_3,You can always change into something more comfortable here.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_4,Need my help with your dress?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_5,I would if I could.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_6,"But, I didn't bring any change of clothes."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_7,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_8,"Um... I-if it's okay with you, Master..."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_9,c-can I borrow your shirt for a moment?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_10,!!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_11,W-w-what did you say?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_12,"Oh, Master, I didn't expect that from you!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_13,"Wow, you're really full of mischief!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_04_14,Privaty and I talk about maid outfits.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_1,Soda wants me to help her with cleaning after we're done today.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_2,... Is there any way we can extend today's session?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_3,I absolutely hate cleaning.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_4,You're free to hide in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_5,"Sorry, but our session is over. I'll contact Soda right away."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_6,"The Commander's Room? Well, that's not a bad idea."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_7,"Where specifically should I hide, though?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_8,The shower might be the best place...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_9,Wh-what?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_10,It hasn't even been ten minutes since I got here.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_11,That's hardly what I'd call a proper counseling session!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_12,"You're pulling my leg, aren't you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_05_13,I spend some time in the Commander's Room with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_1,"No matter how many times I do it, I can never get used to saying ""Master""."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_2,What do you think about being called Master?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_3,"It does feel a bit funny at times, because I'm not used to it."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_4,It feels wonderful when you call me that.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_5,"Okay, so I'm not the only one after all."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_6,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_7,Wait...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_8,What do you mean you feel funny when I call you Master?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_9,Co-come again? You like it when I call you that?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_10,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_11,"Hehe! In that case, I'll call you that whenever I'm dressed as a maid."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_12,"Who knows, maybe I'll get used to it."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_06_13,Privaty and I talk about forms of address.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_1,Cocoa made me a ketchup cake today.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_2,"It's not like anything I've had before, but it wasn't half bad."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_3,You certainly have... unique tastes.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_4,I'm a big fan of ketchup cake as well.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_5,"Hey, don't judge me!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_6,"Once you get used to it, it tastes kinda similar to this dessert they serve at one of those Royal Road cafes."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_7,It's nice to see we've got the same tastes.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_8,Just thinking about it is enough to make my mouth water...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_9,!!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_10,Fo-forget that last bit I said!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_07_11,Privaty and I talk about the ketchup cake.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_1,"M-Master,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_2,are you back?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_3,"I'm back, my little kitty cat."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_4,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_5,Ki-ki-kitty cat?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_6,Ar-are you saying I'm as adorable as a kitty?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_7,... Why are you not saying anything?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_8,"Oh, come on! A little witty comeback wouldn't hurt, you know!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_9,Hmph!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_08_10,I spend a joyful counseling session with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_1,A customer complimented me today.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_2,"I have to say, it feels good whenever that happens."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_3,That's because you're totally the best!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_4,*Pats Privaty on the head*
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_5,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_6,... What do you think you're doing right now?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_7,"H-h-hey, what's this?! You startled me!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_8,"... Customers usually shower me with compliments,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_9,but I guess your praise isn't too bad either.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_09_10,I spend some time giving Privaty more compliments.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_1,I had to run some errands at the Courthouse today.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_2,"When I got back, Yulha and Admi were just staring at me, not saying a word."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_3,Why do you think they were doing that?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_4,Because you're so adorable in that outfit.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_5,Because you look a bit strange in that outfit.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_6,Y-you mean Yulha and Admi think I'm cute?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_7,... I'll have to ask them the next time I see them.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_8,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_9,"What about you, Master? Do you find me cute in this?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_10,"I-I was just wondering, that's all!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_11,W-what?! How so?!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_12,"Hold on... you don't think I look strange in this outfit, do you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_10_13,Privaty and I have a nice heart-to-heart.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_1,"I wonder if it's because of my job at the Maid Cafe,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_2,but I've been craving sweets these days.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_3,"What's your favorite dessert, Master?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_4,Chocolate that's smeared on your lips.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_5,I like pretty much anything that's sweet.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_6,...!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_7,Excuse me?! Did you just say what I think you said?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_8,"You really have no filter, do you, Master?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_9,"Wow, really? That's unexpected."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_10,I thought you wouldn't be a big fan of sweets.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_11,"Well, if you happen to visit the Maid Cafe next time, I'll whip up a sugary treat for you."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_11_12,Privaty and I talk about snacks.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_1,Ahem.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_2,Ade gave me some cooking tips today.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_3,Is there anything special you'd like me to prepare for you?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_4,I'm sure I'll like anything you make.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_5,I'm fine as long as it's edible.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_6,W-will you really like whatever I make?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_7,In that case... I'll make you some omurice that I'm pretty good at.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_8,"Just so you know, the only shape I learned to make is a heart,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_9,so don't go reading too much into it!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_10,...?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_11,What do you mean by that?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_12,Are you saying you don't trust my cooking skills?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_12_13,Privaty and I talk about cooking.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_1,"I've got to draw on my customers' omurice,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_2,but I don't know what to draw...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_3,How about your face?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_4,How about my face?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_5,M-my face?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_6,"... I've never really thought about it,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_7,"but if that's what you think people would like, I guess I could consider it."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_8,Eh? Your face?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_9,I don't really think that'll be in high demand...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_10,"No, I'm sure there might be at least one person who'd be into it."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_13_11,Privaty and I talk about what other things she can draw.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_1,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_2,M-Master...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_3,Why do you keep staring at me?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_4,Because you're so pretty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_5,Because you've got some ketchup on your face.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_6,Y-you find me pretty?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_7,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_8,I know you're just flattering me... but it's working.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_9,Wha...? I-I do?! W-where?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_10,You should have told me earlier!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_11,I don't have a mirror right now... Would you mind wiping it off for me?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_14_12,I have an enjoyable session with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_1,"The dishes are actually done before they're brought out, you know."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_2,Do you really think that reciting spells will somehow enhance the flavor?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_3,"It seems to be getting more delicious, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_4,"Privaty, Privaty, on the count of three, you will fall in love with me! 1... 2..."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_5,You're actually buying into these absurd spells too?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_6,"Fine, I guess we can give it a shot and test some of them out."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_7,W-wait! You shouldn't be reciting that kind of thing!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_8,!!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_9,"Maybe you should... Gah, I just don't know!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_15_10,I spend time reciting spells with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_1,*Sigh*
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_2,"What's the big deal about being served by a maid, anyway?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_3,I just don't get it.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_4,"What would you like to have, Madam?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_5,"I don't quite understand it myself, to be honest."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_6,W-what did you just call me?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_7,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_8,Okay. I think I'm starting to see the appeal.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_9,"As expected! You think the same way, huh?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_10,Wait...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_11,does that mean you don't understand my maid service either?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_16_12,Privaty and I further discuss the concept of maids.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_1,Mmwaaah!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_2,I wonder if it'd be cuter if I make the heart like this...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_3,"As I enter the Commander's Room, I see Privaty on her own, practicing making hearts with her hands."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_4,...!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_5,"M-Master?! Y-you didn't see that just now, did you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_6,Make a heart gesture with your hands to Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_7,"Nope, I didn't see anything."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_8,...!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_9,W-what is that supposed to mean?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_10,"You're not... confessing your love to me, are you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_11,Phew...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_12,Thank goodness!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_17_13,Privaty and I make heart gestures to each other during our counseling session.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_1,"No matter how much I practice, I can't seem to memorize those spells."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_2,I ended up asking a professional voice actor to record it for me.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_3,Would you like to listen?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_4,I'd prefer to hear your voice.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_5,The vibe really hits differently since she is a professional voice actor.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_6,Y-you would?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_7,Ahem.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_8,"All right, I'll recite the spell just for you."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_9,"I know, right? I mean, she is like the most famous voice actor in Ark."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_10,"... But you don't like it better than my own voice, do you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_18_11,Privaty and I talk about voices.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_1,"My meeting ran late, so I hurriedly made my way to the Commander's Room. There, I find Privaty holding a cake."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_2,M-Master! I made this cake for y...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_3,Agh!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_4,Grab Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_5,Grab the cake.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_6,Oh no!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_7,The cake's all ruined now...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_8,Your safety is more important than a cake.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_9,I-it's just a bit embarrassing to hear you say that all of a sudden!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_10,*Crash*
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_11,...
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_12,... Are you okay?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_13,... I'm fine. You and your precious cake can live happily ever after!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_14,I'll leave you two alone. Hmph!
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_19_15,I have a pleasant counseling session with Privaty.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_1,"Out of all of us,"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_2,who do you suppose comes closest to being the perfect maid?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_3,You.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_4,Soda.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_5,Hmm? I certainly didn't expect you to say that.
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_6,"Then again, I suppose I did do a decent job at the Maid Cafe."
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_7,"You've really got a keen eye, don't you?"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_8,Huh? Soda?
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_9,"Just today, she tripped and shattered a whole tray of cups!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_10,"I get that she's been at this maid thing longer and all, but... how could you just!"
d_counseling_privaty_unkindmaid_20_11,Privaty and I discuss the finer points of being a perfect maid.
d_counseling_elegg_01_1,"If you only had 50MB left on your computer,"
d_counseling_elegg_01_2,what would you do?
d_counseling_elegg_01_3,I'm... asking for a friend.
d_counseling_elegg_01_4,I'd go buy a new hard drive.
d_counseling_elegg_01_5,I'd use what little space was left to install a game with a smaller file size.
d_counseling_elegg_01_6,You what?
d_counseling_elegg_01_7,Why would you have to buy a new hard drive?
d_counseling_elegg_01_8,"50MB is still plenty of space for a lot of things! Like BOOM, for one."
d_counseling_elegg_01_9,"Hehe, that's a perfect answer."
d_counseling_elegg_01_10,"And of course, BOOM fits the bill perfectly, since it's just 28MB."
d_counseling_elegg_01_11,"In fact, I feel like installing it on something right now..."
d_counseling_elegg_01_12,Elegg and I discuss the various ways to use up remaining computer memory.
d_counseling_elegg_02_1,*Buzz*
d_counseling_elegg_02_2,*Buzzzzz*
d_counseling_elegg_02_3,*Zap*
d_counseling_elegg_02_4,*Kaboom*
d_counseling_elegg_02_5,"Excellent,"
d_counseling_elegg_02_6,the electrical current is flowing smoothly.
d_counseling_elegg_02_7,Huh?
d_counseling_elegg_02_8,Why did it explode? I'm pretty sure I sent the correct voltage.
d_counseling_elegg_02_9,These wires must be defective.
d_counseling_elegg_02_10,Elegg and I spend time together playing with electricity.
d_counseling_elegg_03_1,"Mr. Commander,"
d_counseling_elegg_03_2,what do you think of Trony?
d_counseling_elegg_03_3,She's great. Competent and cool.
d_counseling_elegg_03_4,Very taciturn.
d_counseling_elegg_03_5,"You're pretty good at reading people,"
d_counseling_elegg_03_6,Mr. Commander.
d_counseling_elegg_03_7,"Without Trony, our squad wouldn't be able to function."
d_counseling_elegg_03_8,Well...
d_counseling_elegg_03_9,"While that may be true,"
d_counseling_elegg_03_10,she excels in plenty of other areas.
d_counseling_elegg_03_11,Elegg and I talk about Trony.
d_counseling_elegg_04_1,Let me give you a hypothetical:
d_counseling_elegg_04_2,"Say there are some guys who are giving you a hard time,"
d_counseling_elegg_04_3,"but it turns out they've been financially supporting your family, who is hard up."
d_counseling_elegg_04_4,"Meanwhile, your parents have known about this the whole time and just never told you."
d_counseling_elegg_04_5,How would you feel?
d_counseling_elegg_04_6,I'd do what I have to to survive; I'd keep accepting the money.
d_counseling_elegg_04_7,"If living meant having to accept dirty money, I'd rather die."
d_counseling_elegg_04_8,I see.
d_counseling_elegg_04_9,"Yes, for some people, survival takes precedence above all else,"
d_counseling_elegg_04_10,"but for me, how you live is even more important."
d_counseling_elegg_04_11,... I see.
d_counseling_elegg_04_12,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_elegg_04_13,"Some people may feel survival takes precedence above all else,"
d_counseling_elegg_04_14,"but for me, how you live is even more important."
d_counseling_elegg_04_15,I have a serious conversation with Elegg.
d_counseling_elegg_05_1,"We all know BOOM is humanity's single greatest achievement,"
d_counseling_elegg_05_2,but what do you personally think is its best aspect?
d_counseling_elegg_05_3,"It has awesome graphics, despite the game taking up so little space."
d_counseling_elegg_05_4,It's big fun in a small package.
d_counseling_elegg_05_5,You're halfway there.
d_counseling_elegg_05_6,Killer graphics are great and all.
d_counseling_elegg_05_7,But!
d_counseling_elegg_05_8,The most important thing about a game is how fun it is.
d_counseling_elegg_05_9,Couldn't have said it better myself!
d_counseling_elegg_05_10,"Usually, games with smaller file sizes are by necessity rather simple, which can sometimes hamper the enjoyment."
d_counseling_elegg_05_11,But not with BOOM.
d_counseling_elegg_05_12,It's got it all!
d_counseling_elegg_05_13,Elegg passionately tells me about her love for BOOM for a while.
d_counseling_elegg_06_1,"Mr. Commander,"
d_counseling_elegg_06_2,do you think that our squad's name was chosen a bit hastily?
d_counseling_elegg_06_3,Electric Shock seems a bit underwhelming.
d_counseling_elegg_06_4,I think it sounds cool.
d_counseling_elegg_06_5,It doesn't really stand out from other squad names.
d_counseling_elegg_06_6,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_elegg_06_7,"Well, as long as you think it sounds cool, I suppose that's all that matters, hehe."
d_counseling_elegg_06_8,I'm happy if you're happy.
d_counseling_elegg_06_9,"I  know a whole bunch of other squad names,"
d_counseling_elegg_06_10,and they all seem way cooler than ours.
d_counseling_elegg_06_11,"Despite that, I still don't think I'd want to change it."
d_counseling_elegg_06_12,I've already grown attached to it.
d_counseling_elegg_06_13,Elegg and I talk more about squad names.
d_counseling_elegg_07_1,What a thrill it is to harness electricity!
d_counseling_elegg_07_2,"Directly controlling an energy source invisible to the naked eye, to make it bend to your command..."
d_counseling_elegg_07_3,I don't see the appeal.
d_counseling_elegg_07_4,So cool!
d_counseling_elegg_07_5,Not many people do. It can be a hard concept to grasp.
d_counseling_elegg_07_6,"But I do take pleasure in it, and it's how I make a living."
d_counseling_elegg_07_7,"If you love what do you, you'll never work a day in your life!"
d_counseling_elegg_07_8,"Hehe, you're adorable, Mr. Commander."
d_counseling_elegg_07_9,"I realize that harnessing electricity may be a difficult concept to grasp, but once you take a closer look, it can be incredibly fun."
d_counseling_elegg_07_10,"If you ever want to learn more, I'd be more than happy to teach you, hehe."
d_counseling_elegg_07_11,Elegg and I enjoy our session together.
d_counseling_elegg_08_1,"Let's see, first turn this..."
d_counseling_elegg_08_2,"Then crank that, and..."
d_counseling_elegg_08_3,Tah-dah! BOOM is officially installed on your shower mirror!
d_counseling_elegg_08_4,Now I'll be able to amuse myself while showering.
d_counseling_elegg_08_5,How did you install that game on a mirror?
d_counseling_elegg_08_6,Exactly!
d_counseling_elegg_08_7,You can control it using the tap and shower head.
d_counseling_elegg_08_8,Have fun playing!
d_counseling_elegg_08_9,Didn't you know?
d_counseling_elegg_08_10,Your mirror is actually a high-tech display screen.
d_counseling_elegg_08_11,Haven't you ever looked in the upper corner? It shows the news and weather reports.
d_counseling_elegg_08_12,I end the session feeling excited about playing games in the shower.
d_counseling_elegg_09_1,I love winter.
d_counseling_elegg_09_2,Nothing beats a clear winter day.
d_counseling_elegg_09_3,Can you guess why?
d_counseling_elegg_09_4,Because it's dry?
d_counseling_elegg_09_5,Because you like the cold?
d_counseling_elegg_09_6,Exactly!
d_counseling_elegg_09_7,And dry weather means a whole lotta static electricity.
d_counseling_elegg_09_8,That tingling sensation feels amazing! Hehehe!
d_counseling_elegg_09_9,"Oh, I guess I never told you."
d_counseling_elegg_09_10,I'm not a fan of the cold.
d_counseling_elegg_09_11,I'm more into dry weather because that's when static electricity builds up.
d_counseling_elegg_09_12,That tingling sensation is pure ecstasy! Hehehe!
d_counseling_elegg_09_13,I spend time with Elegg generating static electricity.
d_counseling_elegg_10_1,Let's play a word game!
d_counseling_elegg_10_2,"Give me four words that start with the letter ""E""."
d_counseling_elegg_10_3,"ElecTronycs, electricity, electrolyte, electromagnetic."
d_counseling_elegg_10_4,"Enemies, extraction point, encirclement, exterminate."
d_counseling_elegg_10_5,"Hehe,"
d_counseling_elegg_10_6,I'm a big fan of all those words.
d_counseling_elegg_10_7,You pass!
d_counseling_elegg_10_8,...
d_counseling_elegg_10_9,"You seem to be rather obsessed with war, Mr. Commander."
d_counseling_elegg_10_10,Those are some awfully intense words you came up with...
d_counseling_elegg_10_11,Elegg and I spend time playing word games.
d_counseling_elegg_11_1,"Ah, lightning bolts, those searing flashes of light streaking across the night sky!"
d_counseling_elegg_11_2,"Have you ever seen one in real life, Mr. Commander?"
d_counseling_elegg_11_3,I have.
d_counseling_elegg_11_4,Can't say I have.
d_counseling_elegg_11_5,"Not entirely surprising, considering how often you go up to the surface."
d_counseling_elegg_11_6,"Lightning is an immense energy resource, 
but it's still beyond human control."
d_counseling_elegg_11_7,"Someday, I want to hold lightning in my own two hands."
d_counseling_elegg_11_8,You haven't?
d_counseling_elegg_11_9,"I thought with how often you go up to the surface, you'd have seen some at some point."
d_counseling_elegg_11_10,"Well, I can tell you that it's a spectacular sight! First the flash, then the resounding BOOM!"
d_counseling_elegg_11_11,One day I want to be able to harness the power of lightning.
d_counseling_elegg_11_12,Elegg and I spend time talking about lightning.
d_counseling_elegg_12_1,Hmm? It looks like your watch is broken.
d_counseling_elegg_12_2,"If you give it to me, I'll fix it for you in a jiffy."
d_counseling_elegg_12_3,"You're not going to try and install BOOM on it, are you?"
d_counseling_elegg_12_4,Thanks.
d_counseling_elegg_12_5,Huh?
d_counseling_elegg_12_6,Of course not. There'd be no point.
d_counseling_elegg_12_7,I already installed it on your watch a long time ago.
d_counseling_elegg_12_8,"All right, give me a minute."
d_counseling_elegg_12_9,...
d_counseling_elegg_12_10,All done!
d_counseling_elegg_12_11,I check out my newly repaired watch that Elegg fixed.
d_counseling_elegg_13_1,"Apparently, when you're into someone, there's this tingling feeling in your body that feels like electricity coursing through you."
d_counseling_elegg_13_2,Have you ever felt anything like that?
d_counseling_elegg_13_3,I have.
d_counseling_elegg_13_4,"No, I haven't."
d_counseling_elegg_13_5,Really?
d_counseling_elegg_13_6,"How did it feel, exactly?"
d_counseling_elegg_13_7,Was it like an electrical surge rising from your toes and spreading to the rest of your body? Or like a massive burst that detonated inside your body all at once?
d_counseling_elegg_13_8,Really?
d_counseling_elegg_13_9,I thought for sure you would have.
d_counseling_elegg_13_10,"I'm sure it doesn't literally feel like getting shocked, but I am curious about what that feels like."
d_counseling_elegg_13_11,Elegg and I further discuss the tingling feeling that comes with love.
d_counseling_elegg_14_1,"Mr. Commander, which game is the G.O.A.T: BOOM, or Final Quest?"
d_counseling_elegg_14_2,Give it to me straight.
d_counseling_elegg_14_3,That's not even a question. It's BOOM.
d_counseling_elegg_14_4,"Final Quest, 'till I die!"
d_counseling_elegg_14_5,You're darn right!
d_counseling_elegg_14_6,Most of these games today wouldn't even exist if it weren't for BOOM.
d_counseling_elegg_14_7,There's no comparing the two.
d_counseling_elegg_14_8,...!
d_counseling_elegg_14_9,...
d_counseling_elegg_14_10,I see.
d_counseling_elegg_14_11,I... I can respect your opinion.
d_counseling_elegg_14_12,I spend time discussing games with Elegg.
d_counseling_elegg_15_1,"Mr. Commander,"
d_counseling_elegg_15_2,"what do you think about 
using glitches during speedruns?"
d_counseling_elegg_15_3,Like clipping through forbidden paths and the like.
d_counseling_elegg_15_4,I personally consider it cheating.
d_counseling_elegg_15_5,"As long as players are having fun, that's what's important, isn't it?"
d_counseling_elegg_15_6,"Hmm, I see."
d_counseling_elegg_15_7,"Personally, I don't see anything terribly wrong with it. It's just another way to enjoy the game."
d_counseling_elegg_15_8,Although I do understand why others wouldn't want to use them.
d_counseling_elegg_15_9,I'm glad you feel the same way as me.
d_counseling_elegg_15_10,"For hardcore gamers, speedrunning is just another way to enjoy the game."
d_counseling_elegg_15_11,"While I can understand why some people would have a problem with it, I personally don't see anything wrong with it."
d_counseling_elegg_15_12,Elegg and I enjoy our session together.
d_counseling_elegg_16_1,Energy drinks are remarkable beverages.
d_counseling_elegg_16_2,However!
d_counseling_elegg_16_3,Trony chugs them like there's no tomorrow. It can't be good for her health...
d_counseling_elegg_16_4,Let's confiscate her stash.
d_counseling_elegg_16_5,We'll have to restrict her to a set amount per day.
d_counseling_elegg_16_6,I think that'd be a good idea.
d_counseling_elegg_16_7,"There's nothing wrong with one now and then, but Trony really is excessive."
d_counseling_elegg_16_8,"For the sake of her health, I'll keep the energy drinks under lock and key for a while."
d_counseling_elegg_16_9,"Sure, but do you think she'll actually listen to us?"
d_counseling_elegg_16_10,It might be better to just confiscate all the energy drinks she has on hand.
d_counseling_elegg_16_11,I'm sure she'll come to understand that we're doing it for her own good.
d_counseling_elegg_16_12,I have a discussion about energy drinks with Elegg.
d_counseling_elegg_17_1,A lot of people say that my bangs make me look sulky because they cover my eyes.
d_counseling_elegg_17_2,"Is that what you think, Mr. Commander?"
d_counseling_elegg_17_3,"A little bit, yeah."
d_counseling_elegg_17_4,I can't say I've given thought to your bangs.
d_counseling_elegg_17_5,I see.
d_counseling_elegg_17_6,"I've kept my hair like this for so long, the thought of combing them back is a bit overwhelming."
d_counseling_elegg_17_7,"Sorry if you're not a fan, but you'll just have to put up with it."
d_counseling_elegg_17_8,Huh?
d_counseling_elegg_17_9,Hmm... how should I put this...
d_counseling_elegg_17_10,I guess I feel a little hurt to hear you say that. It's like you're not interested in me at all.
d_counseling_elegg_17_11,I have a conversation about hairstyles with Elegg.
d_counseling_elegg_18_1,I think all of us have people in our lives whom we respect more than others.
d_counseling_elegg_18_2,"With that in mind,"
d_counseling_elegg_18_3,who do you think I respect the most?
d_counseling_elegg_18_4,BOOM Guy.
d_counseling_elegg_18_5,Trony.
d_counseling_elegg_18_6,That's right!!
d_counseling_elegg_18_7,BOOM Guy is so freakin' cool.
d_counseling_elegg_18_8,"He isn't afraid of anything and charges forward without any hesitation. If that isn't worthy of respect, I don't know what is."
d_counseling_elegg_18_9,"I certainly respect Trony,"
d_counseling_elegg_18_10,"but if I had to pick someone that I respect the most,"
d_counseling_elegg_18_11,it's probably BOOM Guy.
d_counseling_elegg_18_12,"Throughout the rest of our session, Elegg continues to shower BOOM Guy with effusive praise."
d_counseling_elegg_19_1,"Mr. Commander, did you know that electricity can change color?"
d_counseling_elegg_19_2,"Depending on the temperature and air composition, it can come in different hues."
d_counseling_elegg_19_3,I didn't know that.
d_counseling_elegg_19_4,"Actually, I did know that."
d_counseling_elegg_19_5,"This principle is actually something we see in our everyday lives, although you'd never guess where:"
d_counseling_elegg_19_6,It's neon signs!
d_counseling_elegg_19_7,The reason neon signs have various colors is because they use different combinations of gases.
d_counseling_elegg_19_8,No kidding!
d_counseling_elegg_19_9,You know way more about this stuff than I thought you would.
d_counseling_elegg_19_10,"I won't lie, though; it is a little disappointing that I won't have much to teach you."
d_counseling_elegg_19_11,Then... did you know that neon signs operate using these principles?
d_counseling_elegg_19_12,Elegg and I enthusiastically discuss how neon signs work.
d_counseling_elegg_20_1,Do you have any idea what that thing Trony rides is? I can't decide whether it's a chair or a table.
d_counseling_elegg_20_2,"Either way, it looks super comfy."
d_counseling_elegg_20_3,I'm thinking of making something similar. What are some special features I should integrate into the design?
d_counseling_elegg_20_4,"Whenever you sit down, a small electrical current will run through it."
d_counseling_elegg_20_5,Have BOOM installed on a display monitor.
d_counseling_elegg_20_6,"Oooh, that'd be nice and tingly!"
d_counseling_elegg_20_7,"But for safety reasons, I'm not sure I'd be able to ride around with it."
d_counseling_elegg_20_8,I'll have to leave it in my room.
d_counseling_elegg_20_9,"Well duh,"
d_counseling_elegg_20_10,"that's a given, Mr. Commander."
d_counseling_elegg_20_11,That's hardly what I'd call a special feature.
d_counseling_elegg_20_12,Elegg and I enjoy talking to each other during our session.
d_counseling_ade_01_1,"Welcome, Master."
d_counseling_ade_01_2,What kind of tea would you like today?
d_counseling_ade_01_3,"Give me the usual, if you would."
d_counseling_ade_01_4,I'd like a nice hot cup of iced milk tea.
d_counseling_ade_01_5,Got it!
d_counseling_ade_01_6,Do you remember what I usually order?
d_counseling_ade_01_7,Of course.
d_counseling_ade_01_8,"You like the Maid For You special blend,"
d_counseling_ade_01_9,"served nice and hot, but not piping hot to the point that it burns your tongue."
d_counseling_ade_01_10,Is that correct?
d_counseling_ade_01_11,Perfect.
d_counseling_ade_01_12,Got it!
d_counseling_ade_01_13,Uh... you're actually going to make that?
d_counseling_ade_01_14,Of course!
d_counseling_ade_01_15,"Don't you worry, I'll have that ready for you in just a minute."
d_counseling_ade_01_16,You won't be disappointed.
d_counseling_ade_01_17,I don't have the heart to tell Ade that I was just messing around.
d_counseling_ade_01_18,Wait right here.
d_counseling_ade_01_19,"I sip on the tea Ade made for me, and we have an enjoyable session."
d_counseling_ade_02_1,What do you feel is the most important aspect of good service?
d_counseling_ade_02_2,That you put your heart and soul into it.
d_counseling_ade_02_3,Professionalism and skill.
d_counseling_ade_02_4,I see...
d_counseling_ade_02_5,I still think that I'm a bit lacking in that area.
d_counseling_ade_02_6,I'll try to remedy that going forward.
d_counseling_ade_02_7,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_ade_02_8,"That's a relief, since that's more in my wheelhouse."
d_counseling_ade_02_9,I guess I'll just keep at it!
d_counseling_ade_02_10,"That way, you'll keep getting the finest service that you can enjoy."
d_counseling_ade_02_11,The important thing is that you're satisfied.
d_counseling_ade_02_12,I have a conversation with Ade about service.
d_counseling_ade_03_1,Master.
d_counseling_ade_03_2,Do you prefer sunny or rainy days?
d_counseling_ade_03_3,You can't beat sunny days. What about you?
d_counseling_ade_03_4,You can't beat rainy days. What about you?
d_counseling_ade_03_5,If you ask me...
d_counseling_ade_03_6,"I like them both,"
d_counseling_ade_03_7,but customers who visit the cafe usually have brighter expressions on their faces when it's sunny out.
d_counseling_ade_03_8,So I think I find sunny days more enjoyable.
d_counseling_ade_03_9,If you ask me...
d_counseling_ade_03_10,"I like them both,"
d_counseling_ade_03_11,but I always get bummed out when I see people all out of sorts
d_counseling_ade_03_12,because they got caught in the rain and their clothes are drenched.
d_counseling_ade_03_13,So I think I find sunny days more enjoyable.
d_counseling_ade_03_14,I have a conversation with Ade about the weather.
d_counseling_ade_04_1,"In a book I read recently,"
d_counseling_ade_04_2,"one of the characters asks, ""What is happiness""?"
d_counseling_ade_04_3,That got me thinking:
d_counseling_ade_04_4,"When you feel the happiest, Master?"
d_counseling_ade_04_5,"When I'm alone in my room, quietly resting."
d_counseling_ade_04_6,When I'm spending time with you.
d_counseling_ade_04_7,"Sure, getting sufficient rest is important"
d_counseling_ade_04_8,"to have a fulfilling day,"
d_counseling_ade_04_9,but don't forget to visit the cafe once in a while.
d_counseling_ade_04_10,"Otherwise, I'll worry about you."
d_counseling_ade_04_11,"Hehe,"
d_counseling_ade_04_12,I feel the same way when I'm around you.
d_counseling_ade_04_13,I love spending time with you.
d_counseling_ade_04_14,Nothing makes me happier than seeing you happy.
d_counseling_ade_04_15,Ade and I spend an amiable session together.
d_counseling_ade_05_1,"The Commander's Room is so immaculate, it's practically sparkling."
d_counseling_ade_05_2,I tidied up a bit before you arrived.
d_counseling_ade_05_3,What do you think?
d_counseling_ade_05_4,I like it. Thanks.
d_counseling_ade_05_5,It doesn't even feel like my room anymore.
d_counseling_ade_05_6,"Hehe, I'm glad you like it."
d_counseling_ade_05_7,You can always call on me whenever you need some cleaning done.
d_counseling_ade_05_8,Oh no! I'm sorry.
d_counseling_ade_05_9,Did I go a little overboard?
d_counseling_ade_05_10,"If you don't feel comfortable in here, I can change it back to the way it was."
d_counseling_ade_05_11,"No, I just meant that it's very clean."
d_counseling_ade_05_12,"Oh, haha! So that's what you meant."
d_counseling_ade_05_13,Ade gives me some pointers on how to properly clean a room.
d_counseling_ade_06_1,"I prepared dessert for you, Master."
d_counseling_ade_06_2,I hope you enjoy it.
d_counseling_ade_06_3,Ade presents me with a three-tiered dessert tray filled with colorful and appetizing treats.
d_counseling_ade_06_4,Isn't it hard whipping up so many different desserts?
d_counseling_ade_06_5,It looks delicious. Thank you.
d_counseling_ade_06_6,Not at all. Nothing is hard when I'm doing it for you.
d_counseling_ade_06_7,Did I look like I was unhappy somehow?
d_counseling_ade_06_8,"If so, I apologize for giving off the wrong impression and making you worry."
d_counseling_ade_06_9,"Wait one moment, Master."
d_counseling_ade_06_10,*Clatter*
d_counseling_ade_06_11,Ade deftly takes out the dish at the very bottom.
d_counseling_ade_06_12,You can start from level 1.
d_counseling_ade_06_13,Let me know when you're done or if you want to switch to one of the other plates.
d_counseling_ade_06_14,"Thanks to Ade, I enjoy a sumptuous afternoon tea."
d_counseling_ade_07_1,The wheel on the trolly that I use is broken.
d_counseling_ade_07_2,"I've sent it in for repairs, but it looks like I won't be able to use it today."
d_counseling_ade_07_3,What a pain...
d_counseling_ade_07_4,Indeed.
d_counseling_ade_07_5,You must be worried for your faithful trolley.
d_counseling_ade_07_6,It'll be fine.
d_counseling_ade_07_7,I'll just have to work a little harder.
d_counseling_ade_07_8,Sorry to bother you with my problems.
d_counseling_ade_07_9,"Ha,"
d_counseling_ade_07_10,"I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful, Master."
d_counseling_ade_07_11,That's quite considerate of you.
d_counseling_ade_07_12,"Yes, in a way, that trolley is my most trusted partner,"
d_counseling_ade_07_13,so I am rather concerned about how it's doing.
d_counseling_ade_07_14,"More than that though, without that trolley,"
d_counseling_ade_07_15,I can't bring you dessert and tea at the same time.
d_counseling_ade_07_16,"To be honest, that's what I find most upsetting."
d_counseling_ade_07_17,Ade and I have a conversation about how efficient trolleys can be.
d_counseling_ade_08_1,"This is something of a random question,"
d_counseling_ade_08_2,but what kind of girls are you into?
d_counseling_ade_08_3,Someone who is reliable and professional.
d_counseling_ade_08_4,Someone cute and bubbly.
d_counseling_ade_08_5,So you like people who share the same traits as yourself.
d_counseling_ade_08_6,I've always considered you both reliable and professional.
d_counseling_ade_08_7,"You are as well, Ade."
d_counseling_ade_08_8,Really?
d_counseling_ade_08_9,"Hehe, I'm glad you see me that way."
d_counseling_ade_08_10,Sounds like Soda is more your type.
d_counseling_ade_08_11,Cute and bubbly would certainly be apt descriptors for her.
d_counseling_ade_08_12,It's too bad I'm not like that...
d_counseling_ade_08_13,Ade and I have a conversation about our ideal partners.
d_counseling_ade_09_1,"One of our customers professed that he was a diehard fan, and asked for an autograph."
d_counseling_ade_09_2,"I've never given an autograph before, though."
d_counseling_ade_09_3,How should I sign my name?
d_counseling_ade_09_4,"Write it down neatly, in block letters."
d_counseling_ade_09_5,Write it down in flowing cursive.
d_counseling_ade_09_6,That should be simple enough.
d_counseling_ade_09_7,Just a moment.
d_counseling_ade_09_8,*Scribble scribble*
d_counseling_ade_09_9,Like this?
d_counseling_ade_09_10,Perfect.
d_counseling_ade_09_11,Hmm...
d_counseling_ade_09_12,"I've never tried writing like that before, but I'll give it a try."
d_counseling_ade_09_13,*Scribble scribble*
d_counseling_ade_09_14,Like this?
d_counseling_ade_09_15,Er... maybe we can try another way.
d_counseling_ade_09_16,I help Ade figure out a pleasing signature.
d_counseling_ade_10_1,Watching Cocoa do her ketchup dance
d_counseling_ade_10_2,"always lifts my spirits, hehe."
d_counseling_ade_10_3,"Do you like it too, Master?"
d_counseling_ade_10_4,I'm not a fan. She always splashes ketchup all over the place.
d_counseling_ade_10_5,"Of course, I love it."
d_counseling_ade_10_6,Oh dear...
d_counseling_ade_10_7,"I suppose you're right, she does tend to make a mess."
d_counseling_ade_10_8,I should have been faster cleaning it up.
d_counseling_ade_10_9,"It's my fault, I apologize."
d_counseling_ade_10_10,"Hehe, I knew that's what you'd say, but I still wanted to ask."
d_counseling_ade_10_11,I've seen you grinning from ear to ear whenever you watch her dance.
d_counseling_ade_10_12,Cocoa will be delighted to hear that's how you feel.
d_counseling_ade_10_13,Ade and I have a conversation about Cocoa's ketchup dance.
d_counseling_ade_11_1,Do you prefer food
d_counseling_ade_11_2,"that you have to dip in sauce,"
d_counseling_ade_11_3,or ones with sauce drizzled on top?
d_counseling_ade_11_4,I prefer dipping.
d_counseling_ade_11_5,I prefer to have sauce drizzled on top.
d_counseling_ade_11_6,"That's perfect,"
d_counseling_ade_11_7,because I prepared a fondue.
d_counseling_ade_11_8,"If you want the full flavor experience, you should dip the baguette into the cheese before digging in."
d_counseling_ade_11_9,I hope you enjoy it.
d_counseling_ade_11_10,Oh...
d_counseling_ade_11_11,"Well, I prepared a fondue, but it might be difficult to eat it if you pour the cheese."
d_counseling_ade_11_12,Sorry to disappoint you.
d_counseling_ade_11_13,No need to apologize. I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
d_counseling_ade_11_14,I finished the fondue that Ade had prepared.
d_counseling_ade_12_1,Where does Soda get all her energy?
d_counseling_ade_12_2,Maybe it's because she's so happy.
d_counseling_ade_12_3,Because she's a straightforward person.
d_counseling_ade_12_4,"Hehe, that's an interesting thought."
d_counseling_ade_12_5,Maybe I'll ask Soda about it next time.
d_counseling_ade_12_6,I wonder how she'll react.
d_counseling_ade_12_7,Is that what you think?
d_counseling_ade_12_8,I thought it was just because
d_counseling_ade_12_9,she's such a positive person.
d_counseling_ade_12_10,"Ade and I find ourselves both thinking about Soda, which puts us in a good mood."
d_counseling_ade_13_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_ade_13_2,"when you've visited the Maid Cafe,"
d_counseling_ade_13_3,has there ever been anything that made you feel uncomfortable?
d_counseling_ade_13_4,"One time, Soda tripped and spilled a tray full of drinks on my lap."
d_counseling_ade_13_5,Nope. It's perfect every time I visit.
d_counseling_ade_13_6,Oh my goodness!
d_counseling_ade_13_7,That must have been a real hassle for you.
d_counseling_ade_13_8,Allow me to apologize on her behalf.
d_counseling_ade_13_9,You're too kind.
d_counseling_ade_13_10,Thank you for always seeing us in a positive way.
d_counseling_ade_13_11,I hope you'll continue to visit us often!
d_counseling_ade_13_12,We'll be waiting.
d_counseling_ade_13_13,I have a conversation with Ade about the service at the cafe.
d_counseling_ade_14_1,I'm a perfectionist when it comes to providing flawless service.
d_counseling_ade_14_2,"Oftentimes, however, Cocoa and Soda seem to have a hard time with this."
d_counseling_ade_14_3,There are moments when I worry that I may be demanding too much from them.
d_counseling_ade_14_4,"What do you think, Master?"
d_counseling_ade_14_5,Having that attitude might make them feel a bit stressed.
d_counseling_ade_14_6,I also won't accept anything less than perfect.
d_counseling_ade_14_7,You think so?
d_counseling_ade_14_8,I suppose I haven't been terribly considerate of their feelings.
d_counseling_ade_14_9,"Thank you for the advice, Master. You've been very helpful."
d_counseling_ade_14_10,I'm glad we're on the same page.
d_counseling_ade_14_11,"It's nice to know that you're on my side, hehe."
d_counseling_ade_14_12,"You're such a kind person, Master."
d_counseling_ade_14_13,Ade heads back to the cafe with a satisfied expression.
d_counseling_ade_15_1,It's rather peculiar...
d_counseling_ade_15_2,"Whenever I'm with you, I always feel at peace."
d_counseling_ade_15_3,Why do you think that is?
d_counseling_ade_15_4,Maybe it's because we're such good friends.
d_counseling_ade_15_5,Maybe it's because you feel you can trust me completely.
d_counseling_ade_15_6,I can tell you for certain that
d_counseling_ade_15_7,that is not the case.
d_counseling_ade_15_8,I've never considered you to be just a friend.
d_counseling_ade_15_9,Wow!
d_counseling_ade_15_10,It's like you're peering straight into my mind.
d_counseling_ade_15_11,I've always trusted and relied on you.
d_counseling_ade_15_12,There's no one else I would wish to serve more than you.
d_counseling_ade_15_13,I spend a peaceful moment with Ade.
d_counseling_ade_16_1,"I'm always so grateful to make your acquaintance, Master."
d_counseling_ade_16_2,I really would like to be able to show you my gratitude.
d_counseling_ade_16_3,Is there perhaps something that you want in particular?
d_counseling_ade_16_4,I'd like to take you out.
d_counseling_ade_16_5,I'd like a coupon for some free food at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_ade_16_6,Would that be enough?
d_counseling_ade_16_7,"Very well, I'll try and arrange for some time off as soon as I can."
d_counseling_ade_16_8,I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
d_counseling_ade_16_9,"This is so exciting, hehe!"
d_counseling_ade_16_10,I'm looking forward to it.
d_counseling_ade_16_11,"Oh, well... sorry, that's not really something I can decide on my own."
d_counseling_ade_16_12,"Soda, Cocoa and I all manage the Maid Cafe together,"
d_counseling_ade_16_13,so I'll have to go back and discuss it with them.
d_counseling_ade_16_14,"Ade and I continue our conversation, with me offering more ideas on things I want."
d_counseling_ade_17_1,*Rustle*
d_counseling_ade_17_2,...!
d_counseling_ade_17_3,"I'm sorry, Master."
d_counseling_ade_17_4,I didn't mean to wake you.
d_counseling_ade_17_5,"I was trying to cover you with a blanket, but..."
d_counseling_ade_17_6,"Sorry, I must have dozed off."
d_counseling_ade_17_7,I was in the middle of a wonderful dream...
d_counseling_ade_17_8,"Hehe, it's all right."
d_counseling_ade_17_9,You're more than welcome to sleep here whenever you're tired.
d_counseling_ade_17_10,Getting proper rest is important.
d_counseling_ade_17_11,"Why don't you head over to your bed, though?"
d_counseling_ade_17_12,I'll go get you some fresh sheets.
d_counseling_ade_17_13,I really am sorry for disrupting your sleep.
d_counseling_ade_17_14,I'll be more careful next time.
d_counseling_ade_17_15,You don't quite look well-rested yet. Why don't you sleep a little longer?
d_counseling_ade_17_16,"We end our session prematurely, due to my fatigue."
d_counseling_ade_18_1,I've just drizzled some ketchup on the omurice.
d_counseling_ade_18_2,Would you like me to say the delicious spell?
d_counseling_ade_18_3,Wait for Ade to enchant the spell.
d_counseling_ade_18_4,Recite the spell yourself.
d_counseling_ade_18_5,May this dish be delicious♪ May this dish be delicious♪
d_counseling_ade_18_6,Thump thump boing♡
d_counseling_ade_18_7,...
d_counseling_ade_18_8,"Hehe, I kind of thought that you would join in."
d_counseling_ade_18_9,May this dish be delicious♪ May this dish be delicious♪
d_counseling_ade_18_10,Thump thump boing♡
d_counseling_ade_18_11,"Oh my goodness,"
d_counseling_ade_18_12,you memorized the entire thing.
d_counseling_ade_18_13,"Well, I'm sure your omurice will be extra delicious now, hehe."
d_counseling_ade_18_14,"Indeed, the omurice proved to be exceptionally delicious."
d_counseling_ade_19_1,One of our regular customers said that
d_counseling_ade_19_2,he wanted to see us in different uniforms.
d_counseling_ade_19_3,What do you think of that?
d_counseling_ade_19_4,I don't think anything can top your maid uniforms.
d_counseling_ade_19_5,"Actually, I'm curious to see what you'd look like in casual clothes."
d_counseling_ade_19_6,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_ade_19_7,A maid uniform goes hand in hand with providing the best service.
d_counseling_ade_19_8,It's the look that I personally prefer.
d_counseling_ade_19_9,I'm glad you understand that.
d_counseling_ade_19_10,So you're curious as well?
d_counseling_ade_19_11,"All right, I'll try on something different next time."
d_counseling_ade_19_12,"I'm a bit worried though, because I'm not used to wearing something casual."
d_counseling_ade_19_13,I have a conversation with Ade about outfits.
d_counseling_ade_20_1,"What do you usually do on your days off, Master?"
d_counseling_ade_20_2,I usually hang out in my room and relax.
d_counseling_ade_20_3,I go out and about.
d_counseling_ade_20_4,"It's nice to have a relaxing day in,"
d_counseling_ade_20_5,but I hope that you'll find it in you to visit our cafe sometimes.
d_counseling_ade_20_6,Things always seem a bit dreary here without you.
d_counseling_ade_20_7,Then you can drop by the cafe
d_counseling_ade_20_8,on your next day off!
d_counseling_ade_20_9,I guarantee that we'll provide you with the best service you've ever experienced.
d_counseling_ade_20_10,I'm looking forward to seeing you.
d_counseling_ade_20_11,Ade and I have a conversation about the importance of rest.
d_counseling_bay_01_1,"Coach, I'm curious:"
d_counseling_bay_01_2,What kind of cheerleading style do you like best?
d_counseling_bay_01_3,The proficient kind that involves a lot of skill.
d_counseling_bay_01_4,The explosive kind that involves a lot of energy.
d_counseling_bay_01_5,... I see.
d_counseling_bay_01_6,"If we want to improve our overall skill level,"
d_counseling_bay_01_7,Rewind will have to put in a lot of hours.
d_counseling_bay_01_8,...!
d_counseling_bay_01_9,You feel that way too?
d_counseling_bay_01_10,That's what our fans told us.
d_counseling_bay_01_11,They said that
d_counseling_bay_01_12,our energy is what they love most.
d_counseling_bay_01_13,I'm happy to hear that you think that as well.
d_counseling_bay_01_14,I share insights about cheerleading with Bay.
d_counseling_bay_02_1,"I washed my uniform,"
d_counseling_bay_02_2,but I can still pick up the lingering smell of sweat on it.
d_counseling_bay_02_3,It was so bad that I couldn't focus on practice.
d_counseling_bay_02_4,Do you have any foolproof methods to completely get rid of the smell?
d_counseling_bay_02_5,Use a detergent specially designed for sportswear.
d_counseling_bay_02_6,Try handwashing.
d_counseling_bay_02_7,I didn't even know
d_counseling_bay_02_8,there was such a thing.
d_counseling_bay_02_9,"You know everything, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_02_10,Coach...
d_counseling_bay_02_11,"Once practice is finished, I don't even have the strength to lift a finger."
d_counseling_bay_02_12,How could I possibly handwash my clothes?
d_counseling_bay_02_13,I'll just try changing the detergent.
d_counseling_bay_02_14,Bay and I contemplate the ideal method of doing laundry.
d_counseling_bay_03_1,Go! Go! Victory!
d_counseling_bay_03_2,Go! Go! Victory!
d_counseling_bay_03_3,"When I arrive at the Commander's Room, I see Bay practicing in front of a doll."
d_counseling_bay_03_4,What are you doing?
d_counseling_bay_03_5,You can do it!
d_counseling_bay_03_6,...!
d_counseling_bay_03_7,"Coach, how long have you been watching?"
d_counseling_bay_03_8,For a little while now.
d_counseling_bay_03_9,*Gasp*
d_counseling_bay_03_10,I feel a bout of stage fright coming on...
d_counseling_bay_03_11,!!
d_counseling_bay_03_12,"C'mon, team, give it your all!"
d_counseling_bay_03_13,Bay finishes her cheerleading routine.
d_counseling_bay_03_14,You know how our cheers go?
d_counseling_bay_03_15,Of course.
d_counseling_bay_03_16,"You're a fast learner, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_03_17,"Here, I'll do another routine just for you."
d_counseling_bay_03_18,Go! Go! Victory!
d_counseling_bay_03_19,I sit back and watch Bay practice.
d_counseling_bay_04_1,"Coach, what do you think is the most important virtue a cheerleader should have?"
d_counseling_bay_04_2,A genuine desire to cheer others on.
d_counseling_bay_04_3,Be big and bold with your voice and gestures.
d_counseling_bay_04_4,I think so as well.
d_counseling_bay_04_5,"Sure, it's important to be big and bold with your voice and gestures,"
d_counseling_bay_04_6,but the most important thing is for your heart to be in it.
d_counseling_bay_04_7,...
d_counseling_bay_04_8,"That's important too,"
d_counseling_bay_04_9,but shouldn't having a genuine desire for cheerleading be the most important thing?
d_counseling_bay_04_10,Well...
d_counseling_bay_04_11,I thought you'd know that...
d_counseling_bay_04_12,I have a conversation about the virtues of being a cheerleader with Bay.
d_counseling_bay_05_1,"If we cheer others on,"
d_counseling_bay_05_2,who cheers for us?
d_counseling_bay_05_3,Other cheerleaders?
d_counseling_bay_05_4,I'll cheer for you.
d_counseling_bay_05_5,...
d_counseling_bay_05_6,Is that meant to be a serious answer?
d_counseling_bay_05_7,That's not the most comforting thought...
d_counseling_bay_05_8,...!
d_counseling_bay_05_9,"I didn't necessarily ask for it, but I certainly won't stop you from doing that."
d_counseling_bay_05_10,But...
d_counseling_bay_05_11,How are you planning on cheering me on?
d_counseling_bay_05_12,"Er... just out of curiosity,"
d_counseling_bay_05_13,that's all.
d_counseling_bay_05_14,Bay and I ruminate on being a cheerleader.
d_counseling_bay_06_1,It seems like audiences these days are more into the concession stands than our performances.
d_counseling_bay_06_2,"Do you feel the same, Coach?"
d_counseling_bay_06_3,I can't resist a good snack.
d_counseling_bay_06_4,How could I possibly find time to eat a snack while watching you all perform?
d_counseling_bay_06_5,...
d_counseling_bay_06_6,I see.
d_counseling_bay_06_7,It hurts to hear that snacks take precedence over me...
d_counseling_bay_06_8,I knew you would feel differently.
d_counseling_bay_06_9,I hope you'll continue to support me going forward.
d_counseling_bay_06_10,Bay and I have a conversation about the threat of stadium snacks.
d_counseling_bay_07_1,Clay and I are going to watch a movie. What genre would be good?
d_counseling_bay_07_2,A suspense film.
d_counseling_bay_07_3,A high school film.
d_counseling_bay_07_4,Hmm...
d_counseling_bay_07_5,"It's my day off, so I'd like to watch something a bit more light-hearted."
d_counseling_bay_07_6,Do you have any other suggestions?
d_counseling_bay_07_7,"Ooh,"
d_counseling_bay_07_8,that might be a good idea.
d_counseling_bay_07_9,One where the main protagonist is a cheerleader.
d_counseling_bay_07_10,I'm sure Clay would enjoy that too.
d_counseling_bay_07_11,"Here I was racking my brain all alone,"
d_counseling_bay_07_12,when I should have just asked you for a suggestion.
d_counseling_bay_07_13,"Thanks, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_07_14,I have a meaningful conversation about movies with Bay.
d_counseling_bay_08_1,Sometimes I feel like Clay is too prim and proper.
d_counseling_bay_08_2,"She'll still greet me with,"
d_counseling_bay_08_3,"""Yes, ma'am"" and ""Will do, ma'am."""
d_counseling_bay_08_4,It's all a bit stolid.
d_counseling_bay_08_5,*Sigh*
d_counseling_bay_08_6,I just want things to be more casual and easy. What should I do?
d_counseling_bay_08_7,How about a company retreat for the squad?
d_counseling_bay_08_8,It'll resolve itself with time.
d_counseling_bay_08_9,I don't know about that.
d_counseling_bay_08_10,That might make it
d_counseling_bay_08_11,more pronounced than it is now.
d_counseling_bay_08_12,Then she'd never shake the habit.
d_counseling_bay_08_13,Will it?
d_counseling_bay_08_14,"Sure. You're a good person, and easygoing."
d_counseling_bay_08_15,...!
d_counseling_bay_08_16,You really think so?
d_counseling_bay_08_17,"I'm not so sure myself,"
d_counseling_bay_08_18,but I'll follow your advice and wait.
d_counseling_bay_08_19,Bay and I discuss how she can become closer to her fellow teammates.
d_counseling_bay_09_1,Rewind fans are always saying that my beauty marks are charming.
d_counseling_bay_09_2,"How about you, Coach? Which of my beauty marks do you find most alluring?"
d_counseling_bay_09_3,They're all equally charming.
d_counseling_bay_09_4,The one beside your breast.
d_counseling_bay_09_5,...!!
d_counseling_bay_09_6,All of my... beauty marks...!
d_counseling_bay_09_7,"Even if you talk so nicely, I don't have anything I can specially do for you."
d_counseling_bay_09_8,...
d_counseling_bay_09_9,But Coach.
d_counseling_bay_09_10,"Specifically, what beauty mark do you think... is charming?"
d_counseling_bay_09_11,... Can you tell me one by one?
d_counseling_bay_09_12,!!
d_counseling_bay_09_13,You creep!
d_counseling_bay_09_14,Bay and I have a conversation about beauty marks.
d_counseling_bay_10_1,...
d_counseling_bay_10_2,Bay sits staring silently at the wall with her arms crossed.
d_counseling_bay_10_3,"Is there something on your mind, Bay?"
d_counseling_bay_10_4,!!
d_counseling_bay_10_5,"Oh, hey, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_10_6,"It's just that whenever I look into the audience, I start to get short of breath."
d_counseling_bay_10_7,Will I ever be able to overcome this crippling stage fright?
d_counseling_bay_10_8,You can do this.
d_counseling_bay_10_9,Don't say things like that. You're better than that.
d_counseling_bay_10_10,...!
d_counseling_bay_10_11,I never said I couldn't do it.
d_counseling_bay_10_12,Still...
d_counseling_bay_10_13,Hearing you cheer me on does make me feel rejuvenated.
d_counseling_bay_10_14,... You're right.
d_counseling_bay_10_15,I know that
d_counseling_bay_10_16,cheerleaders shouldn't let their negativity show.
d_counseling_bay_10_17,"But still,"
d_counseling_bay_10_18,sometimes I just need a few words of encouragement from you.
d_counseling_bay_10_19,I proceed to cheer Bay on several times in a row.
d_counseling_bay_11_1,There's nothing like a long shower after a strenuous session of practice.
d_counseling_bay_11_2,Even better if I've got some nice-smelling body wash on hand.
d_counseling_bay_11_3,"On that note,"
d_counseling_bay_11_4,I was wondering if you could recommend a particular scent that suits me?
d_counseling_bay_11_5,A strong and musky scent.
d_counseling_bay_11_6,"Something sweet and sugary, like candy."
d_counseling_bay_11_7,Strong and musky?
d_counseling_bay_11_8,You make it sound like I'm cut out of granite.
d_counseling_bay_11_9,...
d_counseling_bay_11_10,I didn't realize that's the image you had of me in your mind.
d_counseling_bay_11_11,...!
d_counseling_bay_11_12,You think something sweet suits me?
d_counseling_bay_11_13,"If anything, I'd say that more suits Clay."
d_counseling_bay_11_14,"I'm not sure,"
d_counseling_bay_11_15,"but if that's what you recommend, I'll give it a try."
d_counseling_bay_11_16,Bay and I have a conversation about body wash scents.
d_counseling_bay_12_1,I really want to win first place in the upcoming cheerleading competition.
d_counseling_bay_12_2,What song do you think would leave a strong impression?
d_counseling_bay_12_3,An energetic pop song.
d_counseling_bay_12_4,A propulsive rock ballad.
d_counseling_bay_12_5,That seems good.
d_counseling_bay_12_6,I've already got several songs in mind.
d_counseling_bay_12_7,I should start practicing right away.
d_counseling_bay_12_8,"Thanks, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_12_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_bay_12_10,That might be a bit much for cheerleading.
d_counseling_bay_12_11,"If we were to go with that style of song, we might leave an impression different from the one we want."
d_counseling_bay_12_12,Never mind. I'll discuss with Clay what song we want to use.
d_counseling_bay_12_13,I have a conversation with Bay about which song to use during cheerleading.
d_counseling_bay_13_1,*Sigh* I feel like my stamina has been really lacking lately.
d_counseling_bay_13_2,I need to get in better shape.
d_counseling_bay_13_3,What kind of exercises do you think would be good?
d_counseling_bay_13_4,Walking.
d_counseling_bay_13_5,Breathing exercises.
d_counseling_bay_13_6,Hmm... that could work.
d_counseling_bay_13_7,There's no better exercise than walking.
d_counseling_bay_13_8,Would you like to do it together?
d_counseling_bay_13_9,!!
d_counseling_bay_13_10,"I-if you don't mind, I would be happy to..."
d_counseling_bay_13_11,!!
d_counseling_bay_13_12,Does that really count as exercising?
d_counseling_bay_13_13,"If I lean on that, I'll end up so out of shape I won't be able to climb a flight of stairs."
d_counseling_bay_13_14,*Sigh*
d_counseling_bay_13_15,"That's it, you and me. The practice room. Tomorrow."
d_counseling_bay_13_16,We're going to get some exercise.
d_counseling_bay_13_17,Bay lectures me on the importance of exercise.
d_counseling_bay_14_1,"Coach, we have a big problem."
d_counseling_bay_14_2,We lost all the pompoms at the stadium.
d_counseling_bay_14_3,I'm taking this opportunity to buy new ones.
d_counseling_bay_14_4,What color do you think is best?
d_counseling_bay_14_5,"Black, dark as the blackest night."
d_counseling_bay_14_6,Pink. It goes well with the Rewind uniform.
d_counseling_bay_14_7,... Have you been in touch with Guillotine by any chance?
d_counseling_bay_14_8,"A while ago, yeah..."
d_counseling_bay_14_9,No wonder.
d_counseling_bay_14_10,*Sigh* I'll discuss which color we should use with the other team members.
d_counseling_bay_14_11,I figured you might say that.
d_counseling_bay_14_12,That is the safe choice.
d_counseling_bay_14_13,"I was thinking about changing it to black to spice things up,"
d_counseling_bay_14_14,but it's hard to imagine Rewind without pink pompoms.
d_counseling_bay_14_15,"Very well, I'll follow your advice."
d_counseling_bay_14_16,I have a conversation with Bay about pompoms.
d_counseling_bay_15_1,"Tomorrow is a rest day, and we don't have a match or practice."
d_counseling_bay_15_2,I want to take this opportunity to eat something delicious.
d_counseling_bay_15_3,What do you recommend I have for dinner?
d_counseling_bay_15_4,Foods that can replenish energy.
d_counseling_bay_15_5,A salad with chicken.
d_counseling_bay_15_6,I don't know...
d_counseling_bay_15_7,Seems a bit high in calories.
d_counseling_bay_15_8,Can't you recommend something lighter?
d_counseling_bay_15_9,You're right.
d_counseling_bay_15_10,"If I want my cheerleading to be flawless,"
d_counseling_bay_15_11,I should maintain a healthy diet even on a rest day.
d_counseling_bay_15_12,"I knew I could count on you for solid advice, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_15_13,Bay and I discuss dinner menus.
d_counseling_bay_16_1,Who do you think would be a good additional member of Rewind?
d_counseling_bay_16_2,Someone who would help us put on a truly amazing performance.
d_counseling_bay_16_3,Volume.
d_counseling_bay_16_4,What about me?
d_counseling_bay_16_5,Volume?
d_counseling_bay_16_6,"Coach,"
d_counseling_bay_16_7,"you do realize that teamwork is essential for a good cheerleading team, don't you?"
d_counseling_bay_16_8,Volume is a solo act. Why don't you recommend someone else?
d_counseling_bay_16_9,You?
d_counseling_bay_16_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_bay_16_11,That... might work.
d_counseling_bay_16_12,Would you like to stop by the practice room later tonight?
d_counseling_bay_16_13,Bay and I brainstorm about which new member to recruit.
d_counseling_bay_17_1,"Coach,"
d_counseling_bay_17_2,have you ever envisioned how I would look in other clothes?
d_counseling_bay_17_3,What style do you think would suit me best?
d_counseling_bay_17_4,A sophisticated two-piece suit.
d_counseling_bay_17_5,A hip street look.
d_counseling_bay_17_6,...
d_counseling_bay_17_7,You don't think I'd look too formal?
d_counseling_bay_17_8,What if I end up looking awkward and people stare?
d_counseling_bay_17_9,You know how I can't handle being stared at.
d_counseling_bay_17_10,It would be nice if you could recommend something more low-key.
d_counseling_bay_17_11,!!
d_counseling_bay_17_12,Hip...? Me?
d_counseling_bay_17_13,Do you really think that would suit me?
d_counseling_bay_17_14,"I think it might look awkward on me, but if that's what you think,"
d_counseling_bay_17_15,I'll try it once.
d_counseling_bay_17_16,Bay and I have a conversation about what fashions are trending.
d_counseling_bay_18_1,I can't stand rainy days!
d_counseling_bay_18_2,"What about you, Coach? What kind of weather do you like the most?"
d_counseling_bay_18_3,Cloudy weather.
d_counseling_bay_18_4,Sunny weather.
d_counseling_bay_18_5,I'm not a fan of cloudy weather either.
d_counseling_bay_18_6,"Whenever it's overcast out, the crowd isn't as jazzed up."
d_counseling_bay_18_7,*Sigh*
d_counseling_bay_18_8,It's always tough to bring their energy back up.
d_counseling_bay_18_9,You're like me.
d_counseling_bay_18_10,"The weather has to be nice for the crowd to get excited,"
d_counseling_bay_18_11,and that always feeds into our own energy.
d_counseling_bay_18_12,"Of course, we always put our best foot forward regardless of the weather, but..."
d_counseling_bay_18_13,I have a conversation with Bay about the weather.
d_counseling_bay_19_1,"You must have already mastered the cheerleading skills, right, Coach?"
d_counseling_bay_19_2,??
d_counseling_bay_19_3,How about I quiz you?
d_counseling_bay_19_4,What do you call when you stand on one leg and stretch your other leg out behind you?
d_counseling_bay_19_5,Absolute.
d_counseling_bay_19_6,Arabesque.
d_counseling_bay_19_7,... As expected.
d_counseling_bay_19_8,I knew you hadn't mastered your cheerleading knowledge yet.
d_counseling_bay_19_9,*Sigh* Fine.
d_counseling_bay_19_10,"Starting today, I'm going to give you some special training on cheerleading theory."
d_counseling_bay_19_11,"Let's head to the practice room, pronto."
d_counseling_bay_19_12,"Wow, that's correct."
d_counseling_bay_19_13,I actually wasn't expecting you to get that right.
d_counseling_bay_19_14,I guess you really have been studying cheerleading.
d_counseling_bay_19_15,"Then again, I should have expected that you would know everything."
d_counseling_bay_19_16,You're so cool.
d_counseling_bay_19_17,I have a conversation with Bay about cheerleading skills.
d_counseling_bay_20_1,Sorry that I'm late.
d_counseling_bay_20_2,"As Bay frantically rushes in, I notice that she has bandages all over her leg."
d_counseling_bay_20_3,What's wrong with your leg?
d_counseling_bay_20_4,...!
d_counseling_bay_20_5,"Oh, it's nothing."
d_counseling_bay_20_6,This is just part of everyday life for a cheerleader.
d_counseling_bay_20_7,I see. So it's kind of like a badge of honor?
d_counseling_bay_20_8,I hope you didn't get hurt.
d_counseling_bay_20_9,I guess so...?
d_counseling_bay_20_10,...
d_counseling_bay_20_11,But I still hope my teammates don't get hurt.
d_counseling_bay_20_12,...!
d_counseling_bay_20_13,"You're not... worried about me, are you?"
d_counseling_bay_20_14,Of course I am.
d_counseling_bay_20_15,Er...
d_counseling_bay_20_16,"... Thank you, Coach."
d_counseling_bay_20_17,I'll practice more so I don't get hurt.
d_counseling_bay_20_18,Bay and I discuss the ways in which cheerleading can be done safely.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_1,"When you're cornered, forced to extreme measures for a goal,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_2,what's your move?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_3,I'd always look for another solution.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_4,"I'd brace for the fallout, whatever it may be."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_5,"... Another solution, hmm?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_6,"Ideally, that would work."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_7,But the world is far from ideal.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_8,"Sometimes, tough calls are mandatory,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_9,lest you lose everything in your indecision.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_10,Indeed.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_11,"Confronted with a dire choice,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_12,you need to stand ready for the ripples it causes.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_13,The world seldom offers us the luxury of perfect outcomes.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_01_14,I have a bittersweet counseling session with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_1,Someone once asked me
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_2,why I favor the axe
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_3,over the convenience of a firearm in my line of work?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_4,Do you know the reason?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_5,To avoid leaving evidence.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_6,Because missions aren't meant to be a walk in the park.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_7,That's not it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_8,"The traces I leave are none,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_9,regardless of the tool I wield.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_10,That's not why an axe is my instrument of choice.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_11,Precisely. Missions aren't all about ease.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_12,That was my answer to them as well.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_13,"The axe reminds me of the mission's gravity, a burden I choose not to disregard."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_02_14,I have a deep conversation with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_1,"To convincingly play the part of newlyweds,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_2,I checked out a luxury apartment where Sovereigns live for recon.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_3,The fancy decor made it look nice at first glance.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_4,Do you want to live in such a place?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_5,Not really.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_6,Sometimes I kind of want that.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_7,I think so too.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_8,Living in luxury seems pointless to me.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_9,What's inside you matters more than what's around you.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_10,I see.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_11,But I doubt its true value.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_03_12,I have a discussion with D about luxury apartments.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_1,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_2,D comes in disguise.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_3,...?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_4,What's with that look?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_5,Is there any problem?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_6,I just realized how beautiful my wife is.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_7,It's odd seeing you in disguise without a mission.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_8,"Oh, Honey."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_9,"I appreciate the flattery,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_10,but I'm getting into character for an upcoming job.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_11,How about you help me out with some practice?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_12,"This time, you're going to act as..."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_04_13,I rehearse scenarios with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_1,"When a Sovereign moves in,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_2,what's their usual gift for the neighbors?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_3,"Flowers, or something practical?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_4,Flowers.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_5,Something practical.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_6,That fits
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_7,since Sovereigns are all about appearances.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_8,"... So, which is more appropriate?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_9,Genuine blooms or the everlasting kind?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_10,"Practical, huh?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_11,It doesn't seem like something a dignity-obsessed Sovereign would opt for.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_12,I need to think about this.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_13,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_05_14,D mulls over this new puzzle.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_1,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_2,I notice a tattoo on D's arm.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_3,What's up?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_4,That tattoo on your arm... What's it about?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_5,... Nothing.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_6,The butterfly one here?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_7,"You seem fixated on it, despite claiming otherwise."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_8,Are you curious about this butterfly tattoo?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_9,"It stands for transformation, but through death."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_10,A personal marker for why I'm on this path.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_11,A constant reminder to myself.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_12,"You get it, right?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_06_13,I have a conversation with D about tattoos.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_1,Honey.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_2,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_3,My husband?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_4,"... Too formal, isn't it?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_5,D is lost in thought.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_6,What's on your mind?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_7,Honey works fine.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_8,I'm working out how to address you during the mission.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_9,It'd help me act more naturally.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_10,Any suggestions?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_11,Being too formal might look weird for us.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_12,"Good call, Honey."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_13,"... Yeah, that's better."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_07_14,I sort out nicknames with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_1,"Here, take this."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_2,D hands me a heavy bag.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_3,Check it out when you're on your own.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_4,... Got it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_5,"... Nothing dangerous in here, right?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_6,It's full of disguises.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_7,You'll need to get a feel for them before we get going.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_8,"Remember, a good disguise is half the battle."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_9,Practice with them in front of the mirror until it feels right.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_10,Dangerous?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_11,"I don't know what's running through your head,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_12,"but it's just full of disguises, nothing dangerous."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_13,The reason I said to check it alone
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_14,is to keep the mission under wraps.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_15,Sorry if I wasn't clear enough.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_08_16,I learn more about disguise from D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_1,On weekdays... we do this... and on weekends...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_2,D is writing something down.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_3,"I think it's crucial we have our story straight before the mission,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_4,so I'm putting together the backstory for our cover personas.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_5,The paper is brimming with all sorts of backstories.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_6,Is it necessary to be so detailed?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_7,I'll make sure to memorize as much as possible.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_8,"Without a solid story,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_9,we're bound to slip up.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_10,We can't let some minor mistake blow our cover.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_11,"So, tough as it is, you need to commit every detail to memory."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_12,Please do your best.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_13,It's essential for the mission
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_14,that we know our cover as well as our own lives.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_09_15,I work hard to memorize what D wrote.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_3,"Honey, what do you want for dinner?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_4,Anything you make is good for me.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_5,"I've already eaten, actually."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_6,Good.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_7,"Not the response I'm expecting,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_8,but still works.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_9,*Sigh*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_10,"Remember to always stay in character, no matter the circumstances."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_11,That's how we avoid slip-ups during a mission.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_12,"Here, study these menus."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_13,"If you can't improvise, at least memorize them."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_14,She hands me a list of dishes.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_10_15,I receive an acting lesson from D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_3,"You're back, Honey! How was your day?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_4,It's been a long day. What about you?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_5,Erm... I actually just sat around all day.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_6,"Hehe, I've been awaiting your return."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_7,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_8,That doesn't feel quite right. Perhaps...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_9,"Honey, I'll go wash up first."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_10,"This sounds more natural for newlyweds, don't you think?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_11,"I'm not entirely sure about this role, so just go with it."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_12,*Sigh*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_13,"Remember to always stay in character, no matter the circumstances."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_14,That's how we avoid slip-ups during a mission.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_15,"Here, study these lines."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_16,"If you can't improvise, at least memorize them."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_17,She hands me a paper with several lines of dialogue.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_11_18,D and I act out a scenario as newlyweds.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_3,"Honey, is there something you want for our anniversary?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_4,Just some downtime.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_5,How about you? What would you like to have?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_6,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_7,D puts her hand on her axe.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_8,"I-I mean, downtime with you, of course."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_9,"... Next time, you'd better prepare a better answer."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_10,Answering a question with a question. I like it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_11,"When caught off guard,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_12,turning the tables with a counter-question can be a clever tactic.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_13,"Even so, you should always have an answer ready too."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_12_14,I crafted the backstory for our anniversary with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_3,...!
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_4,"Out of nowhere, D comes dangerously close to me."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_5,"Honey,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_6,what's with the red stain on your shirt?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_7,H-huh? Red stain? Where?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_8,"Oh, that? I must have spilled wine on myself."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_9,Could it be lipstick from another woman?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_10,I guess we're done here.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_11,D slaps me on the cheek.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_12,"Wine, you say?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_13,D puts her hand on her axe.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_14,"Yeah, we had wine together yesterday, remember? I must have spilled some at that time."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_15,"Oh, that's right."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_16,D relaxes her hold on the axe.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_17,"Give me your shirt, Honey. I'll wash it right away."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_13_18,I have a terrifying time rehearsing as newlyweds with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_1,"It's time for our session, but D is nowhere to be seen."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_2,*Pitter-patter*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_3,It's raining.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_4,*Zing*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_5,...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_6,D comes in completely soaked by the rain.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_7,... Can you give me something warm?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_8,I'll make you some coffee.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_9,Everything all right?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_10,... Skip the sugar.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_11,"That way, it'll help keep my mind sharp."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_12,Just black and bitter.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_13,... I'm fine.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_14,"At least, the rain is quite nice."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_15,Mind making me a warm cup of bitter black coffee?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_14_16,"With that, D and I sip our coffee in silence."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_1,*Squirm* *squirm*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_2,D's squirming bag keeps bothering me.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_3,You seem fixated on my bag.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_4,D stares at me quietly.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_5,N-not really.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_6,What's in it?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_7,*Sigh*
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_8,You might as well know.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_9,This is...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_10,D places the bag before me.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_11,"It's a trend amongst Sovereigns,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_12,as evident from its distinctive logo...
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_13,Just take a look for yourself.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_14,D opens the bag she's carrying.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_15,"Makeup, wallet..."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_16,It's all the popular luxury brands among the Sovereigns.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_17,... It's so full that it just won't stay shut.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_18,I learn more about luxury brands from D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_15_19,"In the end, I didn't get to hear about what I was curious about."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_1,What's our move if the target figures out we're in disguise?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_2,"Stop the mission, right?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_3,Take the target down?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_4,Exactly.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_5,"We'd have to stop the mission, unfortunate as it is."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_6,"We need to investigate the facts,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_7,and only then can we make a move.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_8,Wrong.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_9,The right call is to stop the mission.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_10,Keep it in mind that it would be unwise to make any move
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_11,without investigating the facts.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_16_12,I have a serious counseling session with D.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_1,"When I'm in the guise of another, I sometimes ponder"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_2,what it would be like to escape this mission and lead that fabricated existence.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_3,"I've thought about that, too."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_4,But that's not you.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_5,"It's tough work, and the idea of something simpler is tempting."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_6,"Still, I've got my responsibilities,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_7,so I can't just quit.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_8,That'd be like shirking.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_9,... You're right.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_10,"With the responsibilities I have, I must stick to the mission."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_11,No cutting and running.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_17_12,I have a conversation with D about the weight of the responsibility.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_1,"To help you better get into character,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_2,I'm thinking of dressing in styles that you like.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_3,What would you like me to wear?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_4,A maid uniform.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_5,A dress.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_6,Oh.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_7,"That's what you like, huh?"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_8,... Got it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_9,D shoots me a despising look.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_10,"Nevermind, I'll decide for myself what to wear."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_11,"Since I'm wearing a bodycon dress,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_12,"I should search for a light, airy dress."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_13,Thanks for the idea.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_18_14,D and I start picking out clothes together.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_1,What do you think about trust?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_2,It's not something you can always rely on.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_3,It's something you can depend on.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_4,"Yeah, I agree."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_5,"In the end, when things get real, you've only got yourself."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_6,You can't just depend on others.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_7,Not for me.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_8,"If you depend on it too much and when reality hits,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_9,you might fall.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_10,"Trust is fine,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_11,but depending too much on someone else is risky.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_19_12,I have a conversation with D about trust.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_1,"Sometimes I wonder,"
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_2,how should we break
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_3,the cycle of evil?
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_4,Track down the root of the evil and destroy it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_5,Make sure whoever does wrong pays for it.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_6,That's a valid point.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_7,"Nevertheless, I question its feasibility in reality."
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_8,... That's true.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_9,Ensuring they get what they deserve
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_10,is probably the most I can do.
d_counseling_d_killerwife_20_11,I have a serious counseling session with D.
d_counseling_kilo_01_1,Erm...
d_counseling_kilo_01_2,Did something happen?
d_counseling_kilo_01_3,I...
d_counseling_kilo_01_4,I slipped again during the test.
d_counseling_kilo_01_5,"Ugh, I'm hopeless."
d_counseling_kilo_01_6,"Cheer up, you'll do better next time."
d_counseling_kilo_01_7,Was the test really difficult?
d_counseling_kilo_01_8,"I know you're just saying that to make me feel better,"
d_counseling_kilo_01_9,but thank you.
d_counseling_kilo_01_10,I'll try harder next time.
d_counseling_kilo_01_11,Well...
d_counseling_kilo_01_12,"Negative. I would categorize the test as exceedingly easy, perhaps overly so."
d_counseling_kilo_01_13,T.A.L.O.S.!
d_counseling_kilo_01_14,Why would you say that?!
d_counseling_kilo_01_15,"I comfort Kilo, who is feeling down."
d_counseling_kilo_02_1,"I've bounced around from squad to squad for so long,"
d_counseling_kilo_02_2,that it's been nearly impossible to build relationships with anyone.
d_counseling_kilo_02_3,I think that's why I feel jealous when I see people form close connections with others.
d_counseling_kilo_02_4,What are you talking about? You have something that you're close to.
d_counseling_kilo_02_5,Huh? Who?
d_counseling_kilo_02_6,T.A.L.O.S.
d_counseling_kilo_02_7,Me.
d_counseling_kilo_02_8,That is correct.
d_counseling_kilo_02_9,"I will never abandon you, so do not fret."
d_counseling_kilo_02_10,I guess you're right...
d_counseling_kilo_02_11,"I mean, you're not technically what I'd call a partner, but still..."
d_counseling_kilo_02_12,...!
d_counseling_kilo_02_13,I... I guess you're right.
d_counseling_kilo_02_14,That makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
d_counseling_kilo_02_15,"Er, no, I-I mean!"
d_counseling_kilo_02_16,Commander...!
d_counseling_kilo_02_17,"I meant something platonic, like a fellow squad member!"
d_counseling_kilo_02_18,"Kilo and I discuss how we each define the term ""partner""."
d_counseling_kilo_03_1,"Commander, in your eyes,"
d_counseling_kilo_03_2,what do you think I'm good at?
d_counseling_kilo_03_3,If I'm even good at anything...
d_counseling_kilo_03_4,I'm not so sure myself.
d_counseling_kilo_03_5,You're good at piloting T.A.L.O.S.
d_counseling_kilo_03_6,Hmm... let me think about that for a moment.
d_counseling_kilo_03_7,"Well yeah, that's a given."
d_counseling_kilo_03_8,What kind of pilot would I be if I could not operate this system properly?
d_counseling_kilo_03_9,"You are a skilled pilot, Kilo."
d_counseling_kilo_03_10,That is something you can be proud of.
d_counseling_kilo_03_11,"Oh jeez, all these compliments are kind of embarrassing..."
d_counseling_kilo_03_12,I knew it.
d_counseling_kilo_03_13,I guess you can't think of anything...
d_counseling_kilo_03_14,It's fine. You don't have to force yourself to come up with something just to comfort me.
d_counseling_kilo_03_15,I know what I am.
d_counseling_kilo_03_16,Kilo and I have a serious conversation about what she's good at.
d_counseling_kilo_04_1,Um... Commander...
d_counseling_kilo_04_2,How is it that you're so... popular?
d_counseling_kilo_04_3,I-I was just curious...
d_counseling_kilo_04_4,Because of my devilish good looks.
d_counseling_kilo_04_5,Because I care for the people I surround myself with.
d_counseling_kilo_04_6,I mean...
d_counseling_kilo_04_7,"No one can refute that, sure."
d_counseling_kilo_04_8,"You're super cool, and there's no denying that,"
d_counseling_kilo_04_9,"but surely there must be other reasons, don't you think?"
d_counseling_kilo_04_10,I think you're right.
d_counseling_kilo_04_11,You're so kind and considerate all the time.
d_counseling_kilo_04_12,"I think that's why I'm so drawn to you, sometimes without even realizing it."
d_counseling_kilo_04_13,Kilo and I discuss other people who we think are popular.
d_counseling_kilo_05_1,"Hello, Commander."
d_counseling_kilo_05_2,T.A.L.O.S. is nowhere to be seen.
d_counseling_kilo_05_3,Where's your partner?
d_counseling_kilo_05_4,Looks like it'll be just you and me today. How intimate.
d_counseling_kilo_05_5,Partner?
d_counseling_kilo_05_6,"Oh, you mean T.A.L.O.S.?"
d_counseling_kilo_05_7,It's in the shop for maintenance today.
d_counseling_kilo_05_8,"You don't feel awkward if it's just the two of us interacting, do you?"
d_counseling_kilo_05_9,I-Intimate?
d_counseling_kilo_05_10,Er... Ah.
d_counseling_kilo_05_11,Oh boy...
d_counseling_kilo_05_12,I-I'm kinda nervous all of a sudden... can't concentrate...
d_counseling_kilo_05_13,Kilo and I have a short chat.
d_counseling_kilo_06_1,"Hello, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_counseling_kilo_06_2,Is Kilo not with you?
d_counseling_kilo_06_3,She is currently sleeping in the cockpit.
d_counseling_kilo_06_4,Shall I wake her up?
d_counseling_kilo_06_5,"Yes, if you could."
d_counseling_kilo_06_6,"No, I'll wait for her to wake up."
d_counseling_kilo_06_7,*Whooosh*
d_counseling_kilo_06_8,"... Hmm? Oh, hi Commander."
d_counseling_kilo_06_9,Sorry for sleeping in so late. I got to bed late yesterday since I was doing work.
d_counseling_kilo_06_10,*Yawn* I still don't feel fully rested.
d_counseling_kilo_06_11,A moment later.
d_counseling_kilo_06_12,*Pooshook*
d_counseling_kilo_06_13,*Yawn* When did I fall asleep... huh?
d_counseling_kilo_06_14,Commander?!
d_counseling_kilo_06_15,How long have you been standing there?
d_counseling_kilo_06_16,You should have woken me up!
d_counseling_kilo_06_17,"It's okay. If you're tired, it's important to get proper sleep."
d_counseling_kilo_06_18,!!
d_counseling_kilo_06_19,I appreciate you being so understanding.
d_counseling_kilo_06_20,Kilo tells me more about why she stayed up late last night.
d_counseling_kilo_07_1,An old colleague I used to work with was saying how she finds it annoying to address T.A.L.O.S. and me separately.
d_counseling_kilo_07_2,She even suggested collectively referring to us as Kilos to make it easier.
d_counseling_kilo_07_3,"I don't know why, but that makes me feel kinda weird..."
d_counseling_kilo_07_4,You are both your own individual people.
d_counseling_kilo_07_5,"Kilos, huh? Has a nice ring to it."
d_counseling_kilo_07_6,... Ah.
d_counseling_kilo_07_7,Hehe.
d_counseling_kilo_07_8,"You're the best, Commander."
d_counseling_kilo_07_9,That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
d_counseling_kilo_07_10,Thank you.
d_counseling_kilo_07_11,Wha... you think so?
d_counseling_kilo_07_12,I wasn't saying there was anything inherently wrong with the name.
d_counseling_kilo_07_13,It was more that I felt like my own individuality was being diminished...
d_counseling_kilo_07_14,... Excuse me?
d_counseling_kilo_07_15,... Never mind.
d_counseling_kilo_07_16,Kilos and I spend some time conjuring up more nicknames to refer to her and T.A.L.O.S.
d_counseling_kilo_08_1,Hehe!
d_counseling_kilo_08_2,What's up?
d_counseling_kilo_08_3,"Ah, Commander!"
d_counseling_kilo_08_4,Today's test results were pretty darn good!
d_counseling_kilo_08_5,"Of course, luck played a big factor, but still."
d_counseling_kilo_08_6,"Yeah, there are some days when luck just seems to be on your side."
d_counseling_kilo_08_7,"Don't downplay your own contribution. Your skill is what did it, not luck."
d_counseling_kilo_08_8,Yeah...
d_counseling_kilo_08_9,I wish I could be so lucky all the time.
d_counseling_kilo_08_10,"At least that would be more consistent than my own skill level, which is so erratic."
d_counseling_kilo_08_11,W-What? That can't be it.
d_counseling_kilo_08_12,Someone like me doesn't have skills. Not like that.
d_counseling_kilo_08_13,"... But still,"
d_counseling_kilo_08_14,it's nice to hear you say that. Thank you.
d_counseling_kilo_08_15,Kilo and I talk more about the tests she's taking.
d_counseling_kilo_09_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_kilo_09_2,what do you think is the most important trait a pilot should possess?
d_counseling_kilo_09_3,A thorough understanding of the machine they're commandeering.
d_counseling_kilo_09_4,Objectivity and quick decision-making.
d_counseling_kilo_09_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_kilo_09_6,I guess that's one way to look at it.
d_counseling_kilo_09_7,That's right!
d_counseling_kilo_09_8,"If you find yourself hesitating at a critical moment,"
d_counseling_kilo_09_9,you're toast!
d_counseling_kilo_09_10,Kilo and I continue to discuss what it takes to be an ace pilot.
d_counseling_kilo_10_1,Commander! Commander!
d_counseling_kilo_10_2,T.A.L.O.S. did something amazing today!
d_counseling_kilo_10_3,"We ran a simulation that had only a 20% success rate,"
d_counseling_kilo_10_4,and T.A.L.O.S. passed with flying colors.
d_counseling_kilo_10_5,"Wow, that's incredible."
d_counseling_kilo_10_6,"Oh come on, are you pulling my leg?"
d_counseling_kilo_10_7,Isn't it?
d_counseling_kilo_10_8,I can't tell you how proud I was!
d_counseling_kilo_10_9,I'll never forget this!
d_counseling_kilo_10_10,Huh?!
d_counseling_kilo_10_11,Of course not!
d_counseling_kilo_10_12,I would never lie about something like this!
d_counseling_kilo_10_13,Kilo proceeds to gush about T.A.L.O.S. for a while.
d_counseling_kilo_11_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_kilo_11_2,have you ever encountered a Pilgrim by any chance?
d_counseling_kilo_11_3,Yes.
d_counseling_kilo_11_4,No.
d_counseling_kilo_11_5,Wow! I figured you would have. So cool!
d_counseling_kilo_11_6,How was it meeting them in person?
d_counseling_kilo_11_7,"They're way stronger than ordinary Nikkes, aren't they?"
d_counseling_kilo_11_8,I hope to be as impressive as they are one day.
d_counseling_kilo_11_9,"Oh, you've never met one?"
d_counseling_kilo_11_10,I thought you would have.
d_counseling_kilo_11_11,Sorry for assuming.
d_counseling_kilo_11_12,I have a conversation with Kilo about Pilgrims.
d_counseling_kilo_12_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_kilo_12_2,do you prefer cloudy or clear weather?
d_counseling_kilo_12_3,Clear days.
d_counseling_kilo_12_4,Cloudy days.
d_counseling_kilo_12_5,Me too!
d_counseling_kilo_12_6,"For some reason,"
d_counseling_kilo_12_7,I always perform better when training is held on clear days.
d_counseling_kilo_12_8,Plus you can see further out when the weather is clear.
d_counseling_kilo_12_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_kilo_12_10,"If it's a cloudy day, I feel like my own mood becomes overcast."
d_counseling_kilo_12_11,Like I'm being drained of energy.
d_counseling_kilo_12_12,So I don't really like cloudy days.
d_counseling_kilo_12_13,Kilo and I converse about our favorite types of weather.
d_counseling_kilo_13_1,"Whenever you're feeling down,"
d_counseling_kilo_13_2,what do you do?
d_counseling_kilo_13_3,I just relinquish control and let it wash over me.
d_counseling_kilo_13_4,I think of the times I did well and try not to be too hard on myself.
d_counseling_kilo_13_5,Wash over you?
d_counseling_kilo_13_6,You mean like detach yourself from your emotions?
d_counseling_kilo_13_7,That's... not always easy to do.
d_counseling_kilo_13_8,Times when you did well...?
d_counseling_kilo_13_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_kilo_13_10,Might I suggest recalling last week when you obtained a high score in the Simulation Room?
d_counseling_kilo_13_11,Oh right. I did do that!
d_counseling_kilo_13_12,"Thanks, T.A.L.O.S."
d_counseling_kilo_13_13,I teach Kilo various other ways to overcome self-doubt.
d_counseling_kilo_14_1,I've found myself
d_counseling_kilo_14_2,wanting more and more to settle down.
d_counseling_kilo_14_3,"I want to have a regular work schedule for once, and steady colleagues."
d_counseling_kilo_14_4,That's been on my mind quite a lot.
d_counseling_kilo_14_5,Isn't that what you're doing now?
d_counseling_kilo_14_6,It will happen to you someday.
d_counseling_kilo_14_7,No...
d_counseling_kilo_14_8,I don't have any outstanding abilities
d_counseling_kilo_14_9,or talents.
d_counseling_kilo_14_10,That's why I can't settle down in one place.
d_counseling_kilo_14_11,You really think so?
d_counseling_kilo_14_12,Should I just keep my head down and work hard at it?
d_counseling_kilo_14_13,"No matter how improbable it may seem, I know that a path will one day open itself to me."
d_counseling_kilo_14_14,"... Thank you, Commander. I feel so much better, hehe."
d_counseling_kilo_14_15,I envision what Kilo's future will be like.
d_counseling_kilo_15_1,I wonder...
d_counseling_kilo_15_2,"If I were to have someone I worked with steadily,"
d_counseling_kilo_15_3,what kind of personality would mesh well with mine?
d_counseling_kilo_15_4,Someone sunny and positive.
d_counseling_kilo_15_5,Someone reliable and assertive.
d_counseling_kilo_15_6,You mean like someone who lightens the mood all the time?
d_counseling_kilo_15_7,Hmm...
d_counseling_kilo_15_8,"I guess that would be nice,"
d_counseling_kilo_15_9,"but if I were always around someone so bubbly,"
d_counseling_kilo_15_10,"they might make me seem like a rain cloud, don't you think?"
d_counseling_kilo_15_11,"Oh, that's a good idea!"
d_counseling_kilo_15_12,That would make me have to be more assertive myself.
d_counseling_kilo_15_13,Plus I could ask them all sorts of stuff.
d_counseling_kilo_15_14,I think it'd make me feel really safe and reassured.
d_counseling_kilo_15_15,Kilo and I make conjectures about her hypothetical future colleague.
d_counseling_kilo_16_1,"Umm, I couldn't help but notice..."
d_counseling_kilo_16_2,the handle on your desk drawer seems to be broken.
d_counseling_kilo_16_3,I could replace it for you if you'd like.
d_counseling_kilo_16_4,How would you do that?
d_counseling_kilo_16_5,It's okay. Don't worry about it.
d_counseling_kilo_16_6,Ah!
d_counseling_kilo_16_7,I'd use the 3D printer.
d_counseling_kilo_16_8,It shouldn't take too long.
d_counseling_kilo_16_9,"In fact, it should be ready by the time we're done with this session."
d_counseling_kilo_16_10,Oh... okay.
d_counseling_kilo_16_11,I'm sorry if I overstepped any boundaries.
d_counseling_kilo_16_12,I just saw how the handle was dangling there...
d_counseling_kilo_16_13,Kilo and I continue with our counseling session.
d_counseling_kilo_17_1,"Commander, you're here early!"
d_counseling_kilo_17_2,I... er...
d_counseling_kilo_17_3,How does T.A.L.O.S. look today?
d_counseling_kilo_17_4,What do you mean?
d_counseling_kilo_17_5,Hmm... It seems shinier.
d_counseling_kilo_17_6,Huh?
d_counseling_kilo_17_7,Don't you notice anything different?
d_counseling_kilo_17_8,No.
d_counseling_kilo_17_9,No way...
d_counseling_kilo_17_10,I've been spending so much time cleaning it...
d_counseling_kilo_17_11,"Hehe, that's right!"
d_counseling_kilo_17_12,I've spent the better half of the day
d_counseling_kilo_17_13,giving it a spit shine.
d_counseling_kilo_17_14,I'm so glad you noticed!
d_counseling_kilo_17_15,"I appreciate you doing this,"
d_counseling_kilo_17_16,Kilo.
d_counseling_kilo_17_17,Kilo fills me in on the details of how she cleaned up T.A.L.O.S.
d_counseling_kilo_18_1,"I-I finally got some time off,"
d_counseling_kilo_18_2,but I don't know what I should do.
d_counseling_kilo_18_3,What about just resting?
d_counseling_kilo_18_4,Do whatever you want.
d_counseling_kilo_18_5,You mean... just do nothing?
d_counseling_kilo_18_6,"Actually, come to think of it, it's been ages since I last had a proper rest."
d_counseling_kilo_18_7,That's not a bad idea!
d_counseling_kilo_18_8,Thanks for the suggestion.
d_counseling_kilo_18_9,"Hmm, what do I want to do?"
d_counseling_kilo_18_10,I'd like...
d_counseling_kilo_18_11,to get a good score on the tests.
d_counseling_kilo_18_12,That's all I can think of.
d_counseling_kilo_18_13,Kilo and I have a conversation about vacations.
d_counseling_kilo_19_1,"Hello, {AccountData.NickName}."
d_counseling_kilo_19_2,Kilo is currently occupied.
d_counseling_kilo_19_3,"She will return momentarily, however."
d_counseling_kilo_19_4,"If we're going to wait, I might as well entertain myself."
d_counseling_kilo_19_5,"T.A.L.O.S. is capable of all sorts of things, so let's see what it can do."
d_counseling_kilo_19_6,"T.A.L.O.S., sing a song."
d_counseling_kilo_19_7,"T.A.L.O.S., dance."
d_counseling_kilo_19_8,Which genre would you prefer?
d_counseling_kilo_19_9,"Anything, whatever you're good at."
d_counseling_kilo_19_10,Understood.
d_counseling_kilo_19_11,"Butterfly♪, butterfly♪"
d_counseling_kilo_19_12,Come fly over here♪
d_counseling_kilo_19_13,"To dance, I would require a larger surface."
d_counseling_kilo_19_14,"I do not recommend dancing in this location, as doing so could cause damage to the Commander's Room."
d_counseling_kilo_19_15,Okay... then how about singing?
d_counseling_kilo_19_16,Understood.
d_counseling_kilo_19_17,The sound of T.A.L.O.S. singing a children's lullaby fills the room.
d_counseling_kilo_19_18,*Zing*
d_counseling_kilo_19_19,Sorry that I'm late...
d_counseling_kilo_19_20,Huh? What's going on here?
d_counseling_kilo_19_21,Kilo and I proceed to listen to T.A.L.O.S. sing.
d_counseling_kilo_20_1,"If I want to be liked by someone that I've only met recently,"
d_counseling_kilo_20_2,how should I act?
d_counseling_kilo_20_3,The most important thing is confidence. Conduct yourself as if that person is already a long-time friend.
d_counseling_kilo_20_4,"Be careful not to act too impetuously, so as not to arouse suspicion."
d_counseling_kilo_20_5,Oh...
d_counseling_kilo_20_6,I've never had a close friend...
d_counseling_kilo_20_7,so I don't really know what that feels like.
d_counseling_kilo_20_8,"Oh, okay!"
d_counseling_kilo_20_9,That is exactly what I do anyway.
d_counseling_kilo_20_10,"As long as the other person doesn't think poorly of me or think I'm strange, that's good enough for me."
d_counseling_kilo_20_11,I'm glad that I'm on the right track.
d_counseling_kilo_20_12,I have a conversation with Kilo about how to be liked by someone.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_1,"Master, guess!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_2,What's got looong ears and a fluffy tail?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_3,"And when you look into its eyes,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_4,you just can't help but fall in love with it?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_5,Twinkling Rabbit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_6,A rabbit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_7,"Wait, could you be referring to me?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_8,S-so... you've f-fallen in love with me? Ohmygoshohmygosh!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_9,That's right!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_10,"Rabbits are just always soooo cute, hehe!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_01_11,Soda and I have a conversation about rabbits.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_1,I love the color green!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_2,It just gives me this fresh and clean feeling.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_3,"What's your favorite color, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_4,Green.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_5,Black.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_6,"Wow, that's just like me!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_7,Can I ask why you like it?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_8,Because it's the same color as your hair.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_9,"Oh my gosh, really?!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_10,Just kidding.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_11,Hmph... you're just saying that because you're shy.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_12,Black? That's... not really my cup of tea.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_13,Black stains are the toughest to get out!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_02_14,Soda and I have a conversation about our favorite colors.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_1,Master! Master!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_2,"If you suddenly had a lot of money, what would you spend it on?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_3,I wouldn't spend it on anything.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_4,I'd go to the Maid Cafe every day.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_5,You mean... you wouldn't come to the Maid Cafe at all?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_6,How sad... *Sob*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_7,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_8,Just the thought of you coming here every day gets me so excited!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_03_9,Soda and I spend time getting lost in our joyful imaginings.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_1,I just can't get enough of Coin Rush's beds. They're so clean and white!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_2,"As soon as I see those neatly arranged pillows and blankets,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_3,I just get this feeling like everything's going to be fine.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_4,I wonder where I can learn to make a bed so neatly?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_5,I think you're capable of doing it now.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_6,Ask Mustang.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_7,You think so? Hehe.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_8,"All right, then. I'll make your bed today!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_9,*Sob*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_10,It's tough to get some time in with Boss...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_11,Isn't there any other way?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_04_12,Soda and I discuss about other cleaning procedures.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_1,"Master! Do you know that when it comes to cleaning,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_2,it's important to do things in a proper order?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_3,"Tell me, what should you do first when cleaning the floor?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_4,Sweep the floor.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_5,Mop the floor.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_6,"No, no, you need to mop first!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_7,"That way, you don't kick up as much dust."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_8,It's okay if you're not overly familiar with this stuff.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_9,Looks like I'll have to clean your room from now on.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_10,Whoa! How did you know that?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_11,That's a tip that Cocoa doesn't even know about.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_12,Do you still need me to clean your room...?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_05_13,Soda and I talk about the order of cleaning.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_1,"I saw that omurice was served for breakfast,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_2,and it makes me miss Cocoa and Ade so much...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_3,What do you think they are doing right now?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_4,They're probably working like they always are.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_5,They're probably missing you loads too.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_6,Oh boy... it must be awfully busy since I'm not there.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_7,I really need to come in first and hurry back there!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_8,"Oh, Cocoa... Ade..."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_9,*Wail*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_10,I miss them so much!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_11,*Wail*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_12,I've got to make sure I come in first place so that the Maid Cafe doesn't go under.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_13,"I can count on you, can't I, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_14,Of course.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_15,"*Sobs* Thanks, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_06_16,I comfort Soda until she calms down.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_1,Master... I feel like you've been staring at me for a while.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_2,Is there something you wanted to say?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_3,You've got some dust on your face.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_4,You look adorable in that rabbit outfit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_5,*Gasp* I do?!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_6,How long has it been there?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_7,"Aw, man... I better go wash my face again."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_8,"Oh my gosh, really?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_9,"Now, I want to wear these kinds of outfits all the time!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_07_10,Soda and I spend some time together happily.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_1,Alice said that she'll visit the Maid Cafe sometime.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_2,What should I serve to make her happy?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_3,Beef Bourguignon.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_4,Omurice.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_5,Beef bou... bour... er...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_6,But I've never made that before.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_7,I better practice before Alice comes to visit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_8,That I can handle!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_9,"I'll chop the carrots extra fine, so I'm sure Alice will love that, hehe."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_10,I knew it'd be a good idea to ask you for advice.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_11,"Thank you, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_08_12,Soda and I talk more about Maid Cafe's menu.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_1,"There we go, nice and squeaky clean! After a thorough cleaning, I always crave pudding."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_2,"What are you in the mood for, Master?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_3,An adult beverage.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_4,Some dessert.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_5,An... adult beverage?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_6,I don't think I've ever tried that before.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_7,Can I have one too?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_8,"Hehe, we're craving for the same things!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_9,It just so happens I brought some pudding with me.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_10,Would you like to share it with me?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_09_11,Soda and I have a pleasant time talking about food.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_1,"Master, I had a nice dream yesterday!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_2,Guess what it was about!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_3,Cleaning.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_4,Me.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_5,"Hehe, bingo!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_6,"Cleaning is always a blast, even in my dreams."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_7,"What? No, it was about cleaning."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_8,Although it'd be nice if you showed up too...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_10_9,Soda and I talk about dreams.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_1,"Today, someone at Coin Rush"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_2,told me that
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_3,I look like a rabbit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_4,What do you think they meant?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_5,Maybe they're telling you not to hop around?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_6,Maybe they think you're as cute as a rabbit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_7,Oh!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_8,I was in a rush to meet Alice on the second floor...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_9,I'll try and be more careful from now on.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_10,R-really?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_11,"Me, cute? But I'm not nearly as cute and petite as Alice."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_12,"Sure, you're not as petite as her, but that just means you're extra cute."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_13,It... it does?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_14,"I'm not quite sure I follow, but I'm happy anyway! Hehe."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_11_15,Soda and I attempt to decipher what the customer could have meant.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_1,I'm a big fan of hotel blankets. They smell so lovely!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_2,"It seems like they've been sprayed with something nice, and I'd like to give it a try."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_3,"So, what scent do you think would best suit me?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_4,Sweet baby powder.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_5,Fresh lemon.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_6,Hmm... baby powder?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_7,It sounds like something nice and cozy that'd induce sleep.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_8,That'd be perfect for spraying on a bed!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_9,Thanks for the great recommendation!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_10,"I love lemon as much as the next person,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_11,but I'm not sure if it'd go great on bedding.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_12,"I mean, that's something I mainly use for cleaning,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_13,"so if I were to smell that, I might suddenly get the urge to clean. *Sob*"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_12_14,Soda and I have a conversation about which scent to spray on bedding.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_1,"Master, I've been invited to a performance celebrating the end of the Golden Chip event."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_2,What should I wear?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_3,A maid outfit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_4,A bunny outfit.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_5,"Since I'm here representing Maid For You, that sounds like the best idea, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_6,"Thanks for the suggestion, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_7,Huh? Even when the event is over?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_8,"It's a bit tricky for me to wear that, but... okay."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_13_9,Soda and I look into what outfit she should wear for the occasion.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_1,"Master, Blanc just taught me how to play a game called ""Odd or Even""."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_2,"So, you have to guess whether I have an odd or even number of coins in my hand. Do you want to try it?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_3,Sure.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_4,"All right, then!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_5,Odd or even?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_6,Even.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_7,Odd.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_8,"Wow, you guessed correctly right off the bat!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_9,"You're good at this, Master!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_10,"Sorry, but it was even."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_11,Would you like to try again?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_14_12,I play Odd or Even with Soda all day long.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_1,"Master! If another member of Maid For You were to wear a bunny outfit,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_2,who would you want to see?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_3,I can't decide...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_4,Ade.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_5,"Hehe, me neither."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_6,I think everyone would look simply adorable!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_7,Eh? Ade?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_8,Hmm… I think she'd say that wearing a maid outfit is integral to being a maid...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_9,What if you tried one on instead?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_15_10,Soda and I have a fun time letting our imaginations run wild.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_1,"Master, I heard that getting rid of bad luck is more important than chasing after good luck!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_2,Do you know any ways to remove bad luck?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_3,Toss some salt over your shoulder.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_4,I'm not too sure... I only believe in myself.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_5,Huh?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_6,But the floor would get all messy...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_7,Salt is supposed to ward off bad luck.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_8,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_9,"In that case, it's okay. I'll just be a bit more diligent with my cleaning!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_10,Oh dear... that sounds a bit tough.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_11,I'll help you.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_12,"Aw, thanks!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_13,I'll give it my all until the games are over!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_16_14,Soda and I have a conversation about ways to remove bad luck.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_1,"Master, if I get first place in the next game, will you watch a movie with me?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_2,Sure.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_3,Woohoo! What kind of genre do you like?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_4,Film noir.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_5,Rom-coms.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_6,Oh... aren't those movies filled with all sorts of seedy characters?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_7,Sounds kinda scary...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_8,Can't we watch something else?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_9,Sounds like a nice and upbeat genre. I like it!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_10,I'll do my best to win so that we can watch one together!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_17_11,Soda and I talk about movie genres.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_1,*Shake shake*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_2,"As I wake up, I can faintly make out a blurry white furball moving in front of me."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_3,Poke it hard.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_4,Gently pet it.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_5,"Oh, Master! Are you awake?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_6,"Oh, sorry for surprising you. I didn't realize that was your tail."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_7,It's okay.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_8,"Since you were asleep, I figured I'd take the opportunity to clean up your room."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_9,Sorry if I woke you up...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_10,*Shake shake*
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_11,Is it... a tail?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_12,"Oh, Master! Are you awake?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_13,"I was wondering why my back felt warm all of a sudden. I thought it was the sunlight, but it was you!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_14,Sorry for surprising you. I didn't realize that was your tail.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_15,"It's okay, and it's a great morning today!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_18_16,Soda and I spend a pleasant morning together.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_1,"Master, what do you think makes bunny outfits so mesmerizing?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_2,Their sexiness.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_3,Their adorability.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_4,"Sexy, you say?"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_5,But don't they have a cute tail and bunny ears?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_6,Hmm... I'm not too sure...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_7,"I feel the same too, hehe."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_8,"Whenever I see Alice dressed up in these outfits, I just wanna hug her 'cause she's so cute!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_19_9,Soda and I talk about how mesmerizing the bunny outfits are.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_1,"Master! Would you rather wash dishes for ten people,"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_2,or clean the bathroom?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_3,Wash dishes.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_4,Neither.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_5,Even if it's for that many people?
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_6,That's because I hate cleaning the bathroom...
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_7,I see.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_8,"Well, I already did the dishes..."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_9,but that's okay!
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_10,"I like cleaning the bathroom too, hehe."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_11,"C'mon, you have to choose one!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_12,I really can't. Sorry.
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_13,"Okay, fine."
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_14,"I'll just do both, hehe!"
d_counseling_soda_twinklingbunny_20_15,I watch Soda happily clean.
d_counseling_crown_01_1,Welcome.
d_counseling_crown_01_2,Shall we start the concert?
d_counseling_crown_01_3,You mean counseling?
d_counseling_crown_01_4,... Right. Let's start the show.
d_counseling_crown_01_5,"Oh, r-right! Counseling."
d_counseling_crown_01_6,That's what I meant.
d_counseling_crown_01_7,"I simply wanted to test you,"
d_counseling_crown_01_8,and you passed. Congratulations.
d_counseling_crown_01_9,Very well.
d_counseling_crown_01_10,Hmm?
d_counseling_crown_01_11,Why do you have your eyes closed?
d_counseling_crown_01_12,Isn't this the part where we talk to each other?
d_counseling_crown_01_13,I have my eyes closed so I can focus on the concert that's about to start.
d_counseling_crown_01_14,?
d_counseling_crown_01_15,?
d_counseling_crown_01_16,I go over what counseling is with Crown in great detail.
d_counseling_crown_02_1,"Regardless of how long it takes,"
d_counseling_crown_02_2,I will make sure that all the wishes of my people are fulfilled.
d_counseling_crown_02_3,"And what's your wish, Crown?"
d_counseling_crown_02_4,Is that your wish? Incredible.
d_counseling_crown_02_5,I don't have one.
d_counseling_crown_02_6,Huh? Why not?
d_counseling_crown_02_7,"If I had a wish,"
d_counseling_crown_02_8,then I would be consumed by the desire to fulfill it.
d_counseling_crown_02_9,You praise me excessively.
d_counseling_crown_02_10,But yes.
d_counseling_crown_02_11,That is my wish.
d_counseling_crown_02_12,Crown and I talk more about wishes.
d_counseling_crown_03_1,I heard that you have many Nikkes in your care.
d_counseling_crown_03_2,What is your reason for doing so?
d_counseling_crown_03_3,Perhaps it's the same reason that you take care of your subjects.
d_counseling_crown_03_4,I enjoy it.
d_counseling_crown_03_5,!
d_counseling_crown_03_6,I see.
d_counseling_crown_03_7,"Then, you must continue caring for them"
d_counseling_crown_03_8,as you have done until now.
d_counseling_crown_03_9,I see...
d_counseling_crown_03_10,That's not the explanation I was expecting. However...
d_counseling_crown_03_11,You must always be a support in the storm for them.
d_counseling_crown_03_12,"Do you mean ""port in the storm""?"
d_counseling_crown_03_13,"Ah, yes. That's it... hehe."
d_counseling_crown_03_14,"Amidst awkward laughter, Crowd quickly excuses herself."
d_counseling_crown_04_1,"Once we have shown you the way,"
d_counseling_crown_04_2,"you, Chime, and I must return to the Crown Kingdom."
d_counseling_crown_04_3,"Sorry, but you two will have to head back without me."
d_counseling_crown_04_4,It's a pity I can't join you.
d_counseling_crown_04_5,"... I can sense no hesitation in your voice, nor any hint of regret."
d_counseling_crown_04_6,"Very well. For now, Chime and I will be the only two returning."
d_counseling_crown_04_7,"You, however, will remain as one of our citizens, so we will continue to keep watch over you."
d_counseling_crown_04_8,Very good. That is the answer I was looking for.
d_counseling_crown_04_9,"However, do not be upset."
d_counseling_crown_04_10,"You can join us anytime, should you wish."
d_counseling_crown_04_11,Always. Never forget that.
d_counseling_crown_04_12,All of us speculate about when Crown might return to the kingdom.
d_counseling_crown_05_1,What kind of person is Marian
d_counseling_crown_05_2,when she's with you?
d_counseling_crown_05_3,Innocent and pure.
d_counseling_crown_05_4,Kind and warm-hearted.
d_counseling_crown_05_5,I see.
d_counseling_crown_05_6,"In fact, that was the feeling I got when I first met her."
d_counseling_crown_05_7,"However, that has changed somewhat."
d_counseling_crown_05_8,Very much like she is now.
d_counseling_crown_05_9,She takes good care of those around her and is very understanding.
d_counseling_crown_05_10,... She's the same to everyone.
d_counseling_crown_05_11,Crown smiles bitterly.
d_counseling_crown_06_1,Is there anything you would like to know about the Crown Kingdom?
d_counseling_crown_06_2,How did you become the king?
d_counseling_crown_06_3,What is this treasure that you're guarding?
d_counseling_crown_06_4,"One of the citizens wished for me to become king,"
d_counseling_crown_06_5,and so I had to accommodate them.
d_counseling_crown_06_6,It is the king's duty to fulfill the wishes of the people.
d_counseling_crown_06_7,It always has been this way and will continue to be so.
d_counseling_crown_06_8,"As I told you before,"
d_counseling_crown_06_9,that is a secret.
d_counseling_crown_06_10,"However, should you come and visit the kingdom yourself,"
d_counseling_crown_06_11,I will make sure that you find the answer to this question.
d_counseling_crown_06_12,I continue to ask various questions about the Crown Kingdom.
d_counseling_crown_07_1,What do you think
d_counseling_crown_07_2,a king's purpose is?
d_counseling_crown_07_3,To lead the country as the citizens see fit.
d_counseling_crown_07_4,To lead the country as you see fit.
d_counseling_crown_07_5,"Yes,"
d_counseling_crown_07_6,a king always leads the way.
d_counseling_crown_07_7,"They must be a guiding light for their people, a beacon to turn to in times of darkness."
d_counseling_crown_07_8,This is something that I always keep in mind.
d_counseling_crown_07_9,Hmm... it seems you have a different perspective than me.
d_counseling_crown_07_10,"If the people's opinions are not taken into account,"
d_counseling_crown_07_11,how can that be called leading a nation?
d_counseling_crown_07_12,Crown and I deliberate on what it means to be a king.
d_counseling_crown_08_1,"The population of our kingdom has reached 50 people,"
d_counseling_crown_08_2,and so the responsibility weighs ever heavier on my head.
d_counseling_crown_08_3,"Wow, that's a lot."
d_counseling_crown_08_4,That seems difficult to handle alone.
d_counseling_crown_08_5,It's not a lot.
d_counseling_crown_08_6,These numbers will only increase going forward.
d_counseling_crown_08_7,Who's to say you won't also count yourself among the kingdom's subjects in due time?
d_counseling_crown_08_8,It is not difficult at all.
d_counseling_crown_08_9,It is to be expected for a king to be responsible for their subjects.
d_counseling_crown_08_10,You look worried.
d_counseling_crown_08_11,Are you concerned for me?
d_counseling_crown_08_12,You are a kind person.
d_counseling_crown_08_13,Crown smiles warmly.
d_counseling_crown_09_1,Allow me to be straight with you.
d_counseling_crown_09_2,Do you have no intention of coming to the kingdom with us?
d_counseling_crown_09_3,Straightly?
d_counseling_crown_09_4,"I'm sorry, but I don't."
d_counseling_crown_09_5,"I think you meant ""straight""."
d_counseling_crown_09_6,"Ah, yes. Right. That."
d_counseling_crown_09_7,Well? What is your answer?
d_counseling_crown_09_8,...
d_counseling_crown_09_9,Forget it. You don't need to answer.
d_counseling_crown_09_10,Your expression says it all.
d_counseling_crown_09_11,"It is disappointing, but there is nothing we can do."
d_counseling_crown_09_12,"You have said to yourself that you also have something you wish to protect,"
d_counseling_crown_09_13,and I must respect that.
d_counseling_crown_09_14,"As soon as our conversation ends, Crown leaves to go find Chime."
d_counseling_crown_10_1,I'm curious...
d_counseling_crown_10_2,What kind of food is popular in the Ark?
d_counseling_crown_10_3,Gummy worms are pretty popular these days.
d_counseling_crown_10_4,You're always spoiled for dessert choices in the Ark.
d_counseling_crown_10_5,!
d_counseling_crown_10_6,Gummy worms are actually popular in the Ark?
d_counseling_crown_10_7,So that's why Marian is such a fan of worms.
d_counseling_crown_10_8,They're not real worms... they're just worm-shaped candies.
d_counseling_crown_10_9,I suppose that makes sense.
d_counseling_crown_10_10,Chime once made me a dessert that's sold in the Ark.
d_counseling_crown_10_11,Its beauty was so great that I almost felt bad eating it.
d_counseling_crown_10_12,"If I ever have the chance, I would love to taste it again."
d_counseling_crown_10_13,Crown and I discuss the food in the Ark.
d_counseling_crown_11_1,Lovely weather we're having.
d_counseling_crown_11_2,What kind of weather do you prefer?
d_counseling_crown_11_3,Clear and sunny weather.
d_counseling_crown_11_4,Cool and refreshing rainy weather.
d_counseling_crown_11_5,That's my personal preference as well.
d_counseling_crown_11_6,"When it's clear outside, you can see far off into the distance even when you're standing still."
d_counseling_crown_11_7,"It allows you to locate all sorts of objects,"
d_counseling_crown_11_8,which makes our job much easier.
d_counseling_crown_11_9,Do you prefer rainy weather?
d_counseling_crown_11_10,"Certainly, rain is a wonderful thing that nourishes the land,"
d_counseling_crown_11_11,"but if it pours incessantly for days on end,"
d_counseling_crown_11_12,it is not good for our castle in many ways.
d_counseling_crown_11_13,I lay down side-by-side with Crown as we both bask in the sun.
d_counseling_crown_12_1,"Even though she's not here right now,"
d_counseling_crown_12_2,I always feel so safe and secure when Chime is at my side.
d_counseling_crown_12_3,I'm sure she feels the same way about you.
d_counseling_crown_12_4,Hard to imagine someone like Chime will give you a sense of security.
d_counseling_crown_12_5,That's right.
d_counseling_crown_12_6,I know it without her ever having to say anything.
d_counseling_crown_12_7,She is one of this kingdom's most precious citizens.
d_counseling_crown_12_8,She makes me feel perfectly secure.
d_counseling_crown_12_9,"Although combat isn't her area of expertise,"
d_counseling_crown_12_10,she excels in many other areas.
d_counseling_crown_12_11,Crown and I discuss Chime's abilities.
d_counseling_crown_13_1,"Crown looks off into the distance, lost in thought."
d_counseling_crown_13_2,...
d_counseling_crown_13_3,Talk to her.
d_counseling_crown_13_4,Don't say anything and wait.
d_counseling_crown_13_5,!
d_counseling_crown_13_6,"Oh, hello."
d_counseling_crown_13_7,I was just pondering the future of the kingdom.
d_counseling_crown_13_8,...
d_counseling_crown_13_9,Soon after.
d_counseling_crown_13_10,Were you waiting for me?
d_counseling_crown_13_11,You're such a thoughtful person.
d_counseling_crown_13_12,Thank you.
d_counseling_crown_13_13,I spend some peaceful time with Crown.
d_counseling_crown_14_1,So this is Splendamin?
d_counseling_crown_14_2,What does it taste like?
d_counseling_crown_14_3,... Maybe you should wipe the drool from your mouth.
d_counseling_crown_14_4,Would you like to try some?
d_counseling_crown_14_5,*Wipe wipe*
d_counseling_crown_14_6,I-I'm not drooling!
d_counseling_crown_14_7,"It's not me, first of all."
d_counseling_crown_14_8,"If you're offering, I won't refuse."
d_counseling_crown_14_9,*Munch*
d_counseling_crown_14_10,!
d_counseling_crown_14_11,So this is what Splendamin tastes like.
d_counseling_crown_14_12,I share my Splendamin with Crown.
d_counseling_crown_15_1,What are you doing?
d_counseling_crown_15_2,Oh.
d_counseling_crown_15_3,You were using your phone.
d_counseling_crown_15_4,...
d_counseling_crown_15_5,"I can feel Crown staring me down, which is unnerving."
d_counseling_crown_15_6,Is this interesting to you?
d_counseling_crown_15_7,Do you mind? You're staring.
d_counseling_crown_15_8,Very.
d_counseling_crown_15_9,It's been a while since I've seen someone use a phone.
d_counseling_crown_15_10,I find it fascinating.
d_counseling_crown_15_11,Can you show me more?
d_counseling_crown_15_12,I'm sorry.
d_counseling_crown_15_13,"It's just been a while since I used a phone, so I was curious how they work nowadays."
d_counseling_crown_15_14,I show Crown the various features of my phone.
d_counseling_crown_16_1,"Have you seen Chime, by any chance?"
d_counseling_crown_16_2,I haven't seen her for a while.
d_counseling_crown_16_3,Maybe she went out for a walk.
d_counseling_crown_16_4,Maybe she went out to scout the surroundings.
d_counseling_crown_16_5,"No, she's been gone too long for that."
d_counseling_crown_16_6,"Plus, she would have said something to me beforehand."
d_counseling_crown_16_7,"Oh, that could be it."
d_counseling_crown_16_8,Seeing as she left without saying anything...
d_counseling_crown_16_9,"All right, I'll wait for a while longer."
d_counseling_crown_16_10,Crown and I wait for Chime.
d_counseling_crown_17_1,What do you think is the most important part
d_counseling_crown_17_2,of leading a kingdom?
d_counseling_crown_17_3,Comporting yourself like a true king.
d_counseling_crown_17_4,Being wealthy and prosperous.
d_counseling_crown_17_5,You have a similar mindset as me.
d_counseling_crown_17_6,I agree with that thought.
d_counseling_crown_17_7,"I will continue along the path I've chosen,"
d_counseling_crown_17_8,to become a leader worthy of calling themselves a true king.
d_counseling_crown_17_9,"Do you mean ""path""?"
d_counseling_crown_17_10,"Ah, yes, that's it, hehe."
d_counseling_crown_17_11,"While prosperity is indeed quite important,"
d_counseling_crown_17_12,"as one does not want the citizens to live impecuniously,"
d_counseling_crown_17_13,there are other things which are far more important.
d_counseling_crown_17_14,Crown and I discuss the matters in a kingdom.
d_counseling_crown_18_1,"It seems you and the Counters share a strong bond,"
d_counseling_crown_18_2,just like Chime and I.
d_counseling_crown_18_3,I think the Counters and I might have a stronger connection.
d_counseling_crown_18_4,I think you two may have an ever stronger connection.
d_counseling_crown_18_5,"Haha, I see."
d_counseling_crown_18_6,I'm glad you can say that with such confidence.
d_counseling_crown_18_7,I hope you continue to grow that bond.
d_counseling_crown_18_8,"In my eyes, your bond seems no less strong than ours."
d_counseling_crown_18_9,You must have confidence in yourself.
d_counseling_crown_18_10,Crown and I discuss the bonds between us and others.
d_counseling_crown_19_1,*Cough cough*
d_counseling_crown_19_2,Ugh...
d_counseling_crown_19_3,Are you feeling unwell?
d_counseling_crown_19_4,"Eat slowly, or else you're going to choke."
d_counseling_crown_19_5,"No, I'm fine."
d_counseling_crown_19_6,It's just that I have a weak constitution to begin with.
d_counseling_crown_19_7,Thank you for asking.
d_counseling_crown_19_8,... Sorry?
d_counseling_crown_19_9,*Cough*
d_counseling_crown_19_10,I didn't eat anything.
d_counseling_crown_19_11,*Cough cough*
d_counseling_crown_19_12,"Thankfully, Crown's coughing soon subsides."
d_counseling_crown_20_1,"You said you live in a place called the Outpost, right?"
d_counseling_crown_20_2,I would be quite interested in seeing what such a kingdom looks like.
d_counseling_crown_20_3,"If you're curious, you can come visit anytime."
d_counseling_crown_20_4,But it's not nearly as grand as your kingdom.
d_counseling_crown_20_5,I appreciate the invitation.
d_counseling_crown_20_6,"If the opportunity arises,"
d_counseling_crown_20_7,I will be sure to visit.
d_counseling_crown_20_8,I am well aware of its lack of grandeur.
d_counseling_crown_20_9,Anis and Neon have told me about it.
d_counseling_crown_20_10,"They say that while it may not be opulent, it is a fine place."
d_counseling_crown_20_11,I briefly tell Crown more about the Outpost.
d_counseling_trony_01_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_trony_01_2,have you ever heard of Combat Ace?
d_counseling_trony_01_3,Combat Ace?
d_counseling_trony_01_4,Ah...!
d_counseling_trony_01_5,I-I was just wondering if you knew...
d_counseling_trony_01_6,Trony hides two gamepads behind her back.
d_counseling_trony_01_7,"Hey, are you still there?"
d_counseling_trony_01_8,"It's a flight shooting game, right?"
d_counseling_trony_01_9,!!
d_counseling_trony_01_10,Any Commander worth their salt ought to know Combat Ace's lines.
d_counseling_trony_01_11,...!
d_counseling_trony_01_12,... T-that's cool.
d_counseling_trony_01_13,That's right!
d_counseling_trony_01_14,I thought you would know.
d_counseling_trony_01_15,That's good.
d_counseling_trony_01_16,Then...
d_counseling_trony_01_17,"If it's okay with you, would you mind playing a game with me?"
d_counseling_trony_01_18,I have fun playing Combat Ace with Trony.
d_counseling_trony_02_1,Huh?
d_counseling_trony_02_2,*Pitter-patter*
d_counseling_trony_02_3,It's raining...
d_counseling_trony_02_4,"Do you like days like this, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_02_5,"No, I prefer sunny days."
d_counseling_trony_02_6,"Yeah, I do."
d_counseling_trony_02_7,I see.
d_counseling_trony_02_8,That's just so you.
d_counseling_trony_02_9,R-really?
d_counseling_trony_02_10,Note to self: Commander likes rainy days too.
d_counseling_trony_02_11,I...
d_counseling_trony_02_12,like rainy days like today...
d_counseling_trony_02_13,because only when it rains does Elegg not want to go out and play.
d_counseling_trony_02_14,Trony and I lock ourselves in the room and watch the rain.
d_counseling_trony_03_1,"Hey, Commander..."
d_counseling_trony_03_2,What's your dream?
d_counseling_trony_03_3,...
d_counseling_trony_03_4,...!
d_counseling_trony_03_5,W-was that too personal?
d_counseling_trony_03_6,You can just pretend you didn't hear that...
d_counseling_trony_03_7,Enjoying peaceful days like this.
d_counseling_trony_03_8,Reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_trony_03_9,Peaceful days...
d_counseling_trony_03_10,Are we having a peaceful day...?
d_counseling_trony_03_11,I'm not too sure...
d_counseling_trony_03_12,I see.
d_counseling_trony_03_13,That's a great dream.
d_counseling_trony_03_14,"Yes, I hope it'll come true."
d_counseling_trony_03_15,I'll also do my best to help.
d_counseling_trony_03_16,I have a serious counseling session with Trony.
d_counseling_trony_04_1,"Commander,"
d_counseling_trony_04_2,Elegg said I drink too much energy drink...
d_counseling_trony_04_3,and confiscated all of it...
d_counseling_trony_04_4,Ugh... Isn't that too much...?
d_counseling_trony_04_5,How about hiding it secretly from now on?
d_counseling_trony_04_6,How about setting a daily limit?
d_counseling_trony_04_7,...!
d_counseling_trony_04_8,I think that's a great idea.
d_counseling_trony_04_9,"Well, then..."
d_counseling_trony_04_10,Can I hide them here?
d_counseling_trony_04_11,But...
d_counseling_trony_04_12,There's nothing in this world
d_counseling_trony_04_13,"that's as perfect,"
d_counseling_trony_04_14,"perfect,"
d_counseling_trony_04_15,and perfect as an energy drink...
d_counseling_trony_04_16,"Don't you agree, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_04_17,I have a discussion about energy drinks with Trony.
d_counseling_trony_05_1,...
d_counseling_trony_05_2,...
d_counseling_trony_05_3,Trony glances at me silently.
d_counseling_trony_05_4,"Trony, what's going on?"
d_counseling_trony_05_5,...
d_counseling_trony_05_6,...!
d_counseling_trony_05_7,Commander... thank you for talking to me first...
d_counseling_trony_05_8,...
d_counseling_trony_05_9,...
d_counseling_trony_05_10,...
d_counseling_trony_05_11,What's wrong?
d_counseling_trony_05_12,I've been thinking about what to talk about during the counseling sessions since last week...
d_counseling_trony_05_13,"In the end, I can't think of anything,"
d_counseling_trony_05_14,so I've been waiting for you to talk to me first...
d_counseling_trony_05_15,I ask Trony various questions.
d_counseling_trony_06_1,Commander...
d_counseling_trony_06_2,Do you think...
d_counseling_trony_06_3,our squad name sounds weird?
d_counseling_trony_06_4,Electric Shock sounds cool.
d_counseling_trony_06_5,I think it's a bit rough around the edges...
d_counseling_trony_06_6,That's right.
d_counseling_trony_06_7,Our squad name sounds exciting and cool.
d_counseling_trony_06_8,Electric Shock.
d_counseling_trony_06_9,"I've no idea who came up with it,"
d_counseling_trony_06_10,but I think it's fab. Hehe.
d_counseling_trony_06_11,...!
d_counseling_trony_06_12,...!
d_counseling_trony_06_13,...
d_counseling_trony_06_14,... I'm sure others would think the same too.
d_counseling_trony_06_15,Thank goodness.
d_counseling_trony_06_16,I was worried that you might think it's strange.
d_counseling_trony_06_17,Trony and I converse about squad names.
d_counseling_trony_07_1,"Commander, I have a question for you."
d_counseling_trony_07_2,You have to think carefully before you answer.
d_counseling_trony_07_3,...
d_counseling_trony_07_4,Is walking considered an exercise?
d_counseling_trony_07_5,Of course not.
d_counseling_trony_07_6,Of course it is.
d_counseling_trony_07_7,*Gasp*
d_counseling_trony_07_8,"Commander,"
d_counseling_trony_07_9,I never thought I'd hear you say something like that.
d_counseling_trony_07_10,Yes!
d_counseling_trony_07_11,You can get enough exercise in a day just by walking.
d_counseling_trony_07_12,Hehe. I have to tell Elegg.
d_counseling_trony_07_13,I notice the mobile table Trony is riding on.
d_counseling_trony_07_14,"Just when I want to ask if she doesn't usually walk much, I swallow my words."
d_counseling_trony_07_15,I have a discussion with Trony about the unnecessary nature of exercise.
d_counseling_trony_08_1,"Commander, I want to ask you something."
d_counseling_trony_08_2,What do you think of Elegg?
d_counseling_trony_08_3,She is competent and takes good care of those around her.
d_counseling_trony_08_4,She loves BOOM and is cheerful.
d_counseling_trony_08_5,That's right.
d_counseling_trony_08_6,Elegg does take good care of those around her
d_counseling_trony_08_7,and does all that is required of her.
d_counseling_trony_08_8,"Yeah, I'm glad that Elegg is the leader of our squad."
d_counseling_trony_08_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_trony_08_10,You're right.
d_counseling_trony_08_11,That's not the only side of her.
d_counseling_trony_08_12,She's also a great leader you can always count on.
d_counseling_trony_08_13,I talk to Trony about Elegg.
d_counseling_trony_09_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_trony_09_2,...
d_counseling_trony_09_3,Trony puffs up her cheeks and contemplates seriously.
d_counseling_trony_09_4,"Commander, do you think the noodles or soup seasoning should be added first"
d_counseling_trony_09_5,when making instant noodles?
d_counseling_trony_09_6,"Of course, the water should be added first."
d_counseling_trony_09_7,Isn't it best to follow the instructions on the packaging?
d_counseling_trony_09_8,Commander...
d_counseling_trony_09_9,I didn't expect you to flee like this when things get hard...
d_counseling_trony_09_10,"To add noodles or soup seasoning first,"
d_counseling_trony_09_11,that's the question...
d_counseling_trony_09_12,... What a straightforward answer.
d_counseling_trony_09_13,"I've been thinking about it for a week, and thanks to you, it's been resolved..."
d_counseling_trony_09_14,"But don't you just eat cup noodles, Trony?"
d_counseling_trony_09_15,"... Yeah, but I don't like spicy food."
d_counseling_trony_09_16,Then why'd you spend a whole week thinking about it?
d_counseling_trony_09_17,Trony and I talk about how to cook delicious instant noodles.
d_counseling_trony_10_1,"Commander, about the electricity at the Outpost..."
d_counseling_trony_10_2,"Do you, um, know how it's generated?"
d_counseling_trony_10_3,"Isn't Matis working hard, pedaling bikes to generate electricity?"
d_counseling_trony_10_4,Isn't it made by running a generator?
d_counseling_trony_10_5,...!
d_counseling_trony_10_6,I-is that so?
d_counseling_trony_10_7,If it's Matis...
d_counseling_trony_10_8,"Yeah, that makes sense."
d_counseling_trony_10_9,That's right.
d_counseling_trony_10_10,Electricity is typically generated by boiling water to turn turbines.
d_counseling_trony_10_11,This method has been used by humankind since before the Ark came along...
d_counseling_trony_10_12,Trony begins to explain the greatness of turbines excitedly.
d_counseling_trony_10_13,I have a conversation with Trony about electricity generation.
d_counseling_trony_11_1,Hmm.
d_counseling_trony_11_2,Hmmmm...
d_counseling_trony_11_3,Trony puffs up her cheeks and contemplates seriously.
d_counseling_trony_11_4,"Commander, when it comes to naming game characters,"
d_counseling_trony_11_5,do you tend to use the same one?
d_counseling_trony_11_6,"Yeah, it's too much hassle to come up with new ones."
d_counseling_trony_11_7,"No, I prefer giving each character a nickname that suits them."
d_counseling_trony_11_8,"You're right, it's too much of a hassle."
d_counseling_trony_11_9,"All right, I'll just use my old nickname."
d_counseling_trony_11_10,"T.Rony, it is. Hehe."
d_counseling_trony_11_11,"Commander, this is a newly released game..."
d_counseling_trony_11_12,W-would you like to play it together?
d_counseling_trony_11_13,I-I see.
d_counseling_trony_11_14,Hm... Then what should I use?
d_counseling_trony_11_15,"There's this new game, and I'm trying to create a character..."
d_counseling_trony_11_16,"Yet, I've hit a snag right from the start..."
d_counseling_trony_11_17,I help Trony come up with a nickname for her character.
d_counseling_trony_12_1,"Commander, I've got this thing bothering me..."
d_counseling_trony_12_2,"Oh, it's not about me,"
d_counseling_trony_12_3,but rather a Nikke I know...
d_counseling_trony_12_4,"Thing is... after watching the Ark Ranger,"
d_counseling_trony_12_5,she would sometimes... imitate the Ark Rangers...
d_counseling_trony_12_6,And then other Nikkes just happened to see that... Ugh...
d_counseling_trony_12_7,Commander... what should I do now...?
d_counseling_trony_12_8,Let's take this opportunity to promote the Ark Ranger.
d_counseling_trony_12_9,Things will work themselves out with time.
d_counseling_trony_12_10,Promote...?
d_counseling_trony_12_11,"Trony, do you find the Ark Ranger embarrassing?"
d_counseling_trony_12_12,...!
d_counseling_trony_12_13,"No, I don't."
d_counseling_trony_12_14,Got it. I'll give it a try.
d_counseling_trony_12_15,Is that so?
d_counseling_trony_12_16,"No, it won't be long before word spreads that I'd been imitating the Ark Ranger..."
d_counseling_trony_12_17,Tetra will surely sue me for defamation...
d_counseling_trony_12_18,"Commander, it's been an honor to be with you..."
d_counseling_trony_12_19,Be sure to visit me often in the Rehabilitation Center...
d_counseling_trony_12_20,I offer Trony words of comfort.
d_counseling_trony_13_1,"Do you like puzzle games, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_13_2,"Yeah, I like them."
d_counseling_trony_13_3,"No, I don't like them."
d_counseling_trony_13_4,"Hehe, me too."
d_counseling_trony_13_5,"Just like when designing a circuit,"
d_counseling_trony_13_6,it feels incredibly satisfying when the puzzle pieces fit perfectly together.
d_counseling_trony_13_7,I definitely recommend Arkscape and Dragons and Puzzles.
d_counseling_trony_13_8,Would you like to try?
d_counseling_trony_13_9,I see...
d_counseling_trony_13_10,...
d_counseling_trony_13_11,... Y-you might change your mind once you give it a try.
d_counseling_trony_13_12,"Let's play a round... No, how about playing for an hour?"
d_counseling_trony_13_13,I play a puzzle game with Trony.
d_counseling_trony_14_1,"What's the surface like for you, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_14_2,A dangerous place.
d_counseling_trony_14_3,A beautiful place.
d_counseling_trony_14_4,So that's how you think of it...
d_counseling_trony_14_5,"Yeah, it's a beautiful place."
d_counseling_trony_14_6,I...
d_counseling_trony_14_7,I'll never forget the first time I was on the surface.
d_counseling_trony_14_8,The sky that I saw with Elegg back then was incredibly beautiful.
d_counseling_trony_14_9,That's why I'm fighting to reclaim that spectacle.
d_counseling_trony_14_10,I can discern Trony's determination from her words.
d_counseling_trony_15_1,"Who's your favorite Ark Ranger, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_15_2,Passionate Red Ranger.
d_counseling_trony_15_3,Romantic Black Ranger.
d_counseling_trony_15_4,Note to self: Commander's pick is the Red Ranger.
d_counseling_trony_15_5,Elegg said she loves the yellow one the most
d_counseling_trony_15_6,because the color resembles Electric Shock.
d_counseling_trony_15_7,...!
d_counseling_trony_15_8,"Y-yes, it's only natural for romantics to pick black."
d_counseling_trony_15_9,That's why I like the black one the most.
d_counseling_trony_15_10,Oh! I've got loads of Black Ranger merch in my room...
d_counseling_trony_15_11,"F-feel free to come over and check them out, hehe."
d_counseling_trony_15_12,A smile spreads across Trony's lips as she talks about Ark Ranger.
d_counseling_trony_15_13,"Sure enough, you can't go wrong with Ark Ranger."
d_counseling_trony_16_1,I'm told that I have to clean my room today...
d_counseling_trony_16_2,How do I even do that?
d_counseling_trony_16_3,Why don't you start by organizing the room?
d_counseling_trony_16_4,Just hold the trash can and put everything you pick up inside.
d_counseling_trony_16_5,B-but I've already organized everything by my standards...
d_counseling_trony_16_6,"So, I know where everything is placed."
d_counseling_trony_16_7,Oh...
d_counseling_trony_16_8,As expected of Commander...
d_counseling_trony_16_9,I'll give it a try right away!
d_counseling_trony_16_10,"By the way, who told you to clean your room?"
d_counseling_trony_16_11,Syuen.
d_counseling_trony_16_12,I teach Trony the right way to clean up her room.
d_counseling_trony_17_1,Hmm.
d_counseling_trony_17_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_trony_17_3,Trony puffs up her cheeks and contemplates seriously.
d_counseling_trony_17_4,"Commander, why do we have to write reports every day?"
d_counseling_trony_17_5,"I'd like to know that, too."
d_counseling_trony_17_6,It's what needs to be done.
d_counseling_trony_17_7,"No one reads it, anyway."
d_counseling_trony_17_8,I don't see why I have to write it every day.
d_counseling_trony_17_9,... But keep this from Syuen.
d_counseling_trony_17_10,...
d_counseling_trony_17_11,"Commander,"
d_counseling_trony_17_12,I never thought I'd hear you say something like that.
d_counseling_trony_17_13,I listen to Trony's complaints.
d_counseling_trony_18_1,"Commander, what if..."
d_counseling_trony_18_2,I found a bug in a game...
d_counseling_trony_18_3,that all players are using?
d_counseling_trony_18_4,Should the bug be fixed?
d_counseling_trony_18_5,"Still, it should be fixed."
d_counseling_trony_18_6,Wouldn't it be better to leave it as it is?
d_counseling_trony_18_7,As expected... I suppose that's the case.
d_counseling_trony_18_8,"After all, bugs are bugs..."
d_counseling_trony_18_9,"Yeah, I guess it should be fixed."
d_counseling_trony_18_10,Is that so?
d_counseling_trony_18_11,... But what if that bug messes up other code and goes beyond control?
d_counseling_trony_18_12,Wouldn't it be too late to fix it by then?
d_counseling_trony_18_13,I have a serious conversation with Trony.
d_counseling_trony_19_1,Hmm.
d_counseling_trony_19_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_trony_19_3,Trony puffs up her cheeks and contemplates seriously.
d_counseling_trony_19_4,"Where do you like to go to on your day off, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_19_5,Arcade at the Shopping Center.
d_counseling_trony_19_6,My room.
d_counseling_trony_19_7,...!
d_counseling_trony_19_8,S-Shopping Center...?
d_counseling_trony_19_9,E-even on your off days?
d_counseling_trony_19_10,Note to self: Even Commander likes to stay in his room.
d_counseling_trony_19_11,I'll have to tell Elegg that.
d_counseling_trony_19_12,The reason I stay only in my room when I have the day off is
d_counseling_trony_19_13,to become like you.
d_counseling_trony_19_14,Trony and I talk about our days off.
d_counseling_trony_20_1,"What's your favorite food, Commander?"
d_counseling_trony_20_2,Instant food that can be easily consumed.
d_counseling_trony_20_3,Any food that's made with care.
d_counseling_trony_20_4,"Hehe, me too."
d_counseling_trony_20_5,It can be made easily
d_counseling_trony_20_6,and tastes delicious too.
d_counseling_trony_20_7,"Speaking of which, can I have some cup noodles before I go?"
d_counseling_trony_20_8,Elegg will chew me out if I have them at my dorm...
d_counseling_trony_20_9,B-but...
d_counseling_trony_20_10,quick and easy meals are not bad.
d_counseling_trony_20_11,I'm sure you'll change your mind after having some cup noodles.
d_counseling_trony_20_12,I have some cup noodles with Trony.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_1,"Lookie here, a rabbit!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_2,"And over there, a rabbit!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_3,"There are so many rabbits here, I'm so happy!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_4,"I'm happy too, because you're here."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_5,I guess you don't need me around anymore then.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_6,Hehe.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_7,"Even if I'm surrounded by other rabbits,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_8,"I like being around you the most, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_9,What? Of course not!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_10,Why would you say that?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_11,"I like being around you the most, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_12,Alice and I admire the bunnies at Coin Rush.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_1,I want to get a present for Nanook and Pigeon.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_2,What do you think would be good?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_3,Some cotton candy in the shape of a rabbit.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_4,You yourself make a fine present.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_5,!!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_6,"Whoa, I didn't even know that was a thing!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_7,That sounds fantastic!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_8,"I knew you'd come up with something great, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_9,Huh?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_10,How could I be a present?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_11,I think I ought to consider something else.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_12,Alice and I brainstorm what gifts to get for Neve and Tove.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_1,It's been so much fun seeing Twinkling Bunny these past few days.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_2,"I want to keep seeing her,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_3,"but I guess that's not possible, huh?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_4,I could suggest that Soda move up north and live with you.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_5,You can invite her to come over wherever you're living.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_6,What? Move up north?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_7,"Hmm... As much as I'd like that, I don't think it's possible."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_8,She twinkles the most when she's at the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_9,"Oooh, that's a good idea!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_10,"I'll invite her and her friends to come visit me,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_11,and we can have a grand old time playing together!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_12,"You'll come too, won't you, Rabbity?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_13,I have a conversation with Alice about Soda.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_1,"Ever since I came here,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_2,I've been dazzled by all the sparkly things!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_3,"The North is full of sparkly things too. The snow, for one."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_4,Should we try and snitch something sparkling?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_5,You're right!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_6,The snow that the Snow Queen makes sparkles a lot too!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_7,That's why I like it so much!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_8,??
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_9,Why do we need to do that?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_10,"Up north, where the Snow Queen's snow falls, it sparkles so much that it's really pretty!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_04_11,Alice and I have a conversation about sparkly things.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_1,Twinkling Bunny invited me to the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_2,What should I eat when I go there?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_3,Everything on the menu.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_4,Carrot cake.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_5,Huh?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_6,All of it?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_7,"I can't do that. If I did, my belly would end up exploding."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_8,Holy moly!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_9,They make carrot cake over there?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_10,I bet it's delicious! I'll be sure to have a slice!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_05_11,I recommend a few menu items from the Maid Cafe to Alice.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_1,"Hey, Rabbity! Can I tell you something?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_2,I really like you!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_3,I like you more.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_4,I like you too.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_5,What?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_6,No way!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_7,I like you the most!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_8,You do?!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_9,"Wow, that means you must really like me,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_10,cause I reaaaaaalllly like you!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_06_11,Alice and I have a great time together.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_1,I've been wondering
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_2,why is Slippery Bunny always leaking water?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_3,That's her sweating. She gets overheated easily.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_4,She's actually the Water Queen.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_5,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_6,I should ask the Queen to make it snow.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_7,"That'd probably help cool her off, right?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_8,"Whoa, no kidding?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_9,I should introduce her to the Snow Queen.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_07_10,I have a conversation with Alice about Folkwang.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_1,"Hey, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_2,"Since I've become a rabbit, do you wanna have a race?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_3,I'll take you on.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_4,"Sorry, but I'm not up for it."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_5,"Hehe, okay!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_6,3... 2... 1...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_7,Go!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_8,Are you worried that you'll fall asleep halfway through?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_9,"Don't worry, I'll wake you up!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_10,"Let's run together, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_08_11,Alice and I have a race.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_1,Let's play the Jingle Jingle game!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_2,Jingle Jingle game?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_3,*Jingle jingle*
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_4,Tah-dah!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_5,How many coins do you think are in here?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_6,Three?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_7,Two?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_8,Wrong!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_9,"Since it jingled twice, the answer is two."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_10,"If you had guessed correctly, I was gonna give you these coins as a reward."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_11,"Actually, since I really like you, I'll give them to you anyway!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_12,Bingo!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_13,"It jingled twice, so the answer is two."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_14,"Since you got it right, these coins are all yours!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_09_15,... I should return these coins to Alice later.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_1,"Rabbity,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_2,I want to get Twinkling Bunny a present.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_3,What do you think would make her happy?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_4,The luck of a rabbit.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_5,Some cleaning supplies.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_6,Hmm... how can I give her that?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_7,Do I have to dance like the black and white bunnies?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_8,Hmm... she already seems to have a lot of those.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_9,Is there anything else she'd like more than cleaning supplies?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_10_10,Alice and I brainstorm what gifts to get for Soda.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_1,Rabbity!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_2,I had a dream last night where a bunch of rabbits appeared.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_3,What do you think it means?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_4,Sounds like a dream a dog would have.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_5,An auspicious dream.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_6,You think so?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_7,Wouldn't a dog dream of other dogs?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_8,"Hmm... the next time I dream, I'll have to see if any dogs show up or not!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_9,I'll head to bed straight away and let you know how it goes!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_10,Nice!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_11,"In that case, I wanna dream it again."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_12,I'm gonna go to sleep quickly!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_11_13,I wish Alice sweet dreams.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_1,"Rabbity,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_2,what do you think the Queen is doing right now?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_3,Thinking about you.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_4,Having tea.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_5,Really?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_6,"Hehe, that makes me really happy!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_7,I'm thinking about her too!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_8,Do you think so?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_10,Thinking about tea time makes me miss the Queen...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_12_11,I spend time with Alice talking about Ludmilla.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_1,I become so happy whenever I see the white and black bunnies!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_2,Just looking at them lifts my spirits.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_3,Maybe that's why they're lucky bunnies!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_4,I feel happier whenever I see you too.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_5,Do you want to become a lucky bunny too?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_6,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_7,I'm so flattered that I can make you happy!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_8,"In that case, I'll stick by your side from here on out."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_9,Hmm... Not really.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_10,Just having those two is plenty enough!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_11,Being by your side fills me with boundless joy!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_13_12,Alice and I have a conversation about the lucky bunnies.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_1,I like Doctor Rabbit!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_2,She's so kind and gentle!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_3,I bet you won't even feel a thing when she gives you the injection!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_4,I don't know about that...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_5,You're right. It doesn't hurt at all.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_6,But she's so considerate!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_7,I bet you won't even feel a thing when she gives you an injection!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_8,"I knew it, hehe!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_9,That's because she's so considerate!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_10,"She's always been that way, even before—"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_11,Wait... before...?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_12,Alice?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_13,"I dunno, I've got this strange feeling... that I used to know Mary?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_14,Maybe it's because I like her so much!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_14_15,Alice and I have a conversation about Mary.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_1,Rabbity.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_2,What do you think it would be like if my Queen becomes a rabbit as well?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_3,Then she'd become Device Demolisher Bunny.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_4,Then she'd become Snow Queen Bunny.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_5,Device Demolisher Bunny?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_6,I don't get it.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_7,Don't you think she'd become something more like a Queen Bunny?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_8,Ooooh!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_9,That sounds so cool!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_15_10,Alice and I have a conversation about Ludmilla.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_1,"Sweep, sweep!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_2,"What are you up to, Alice?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_3,"Hey, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_4,I'm playing a cleaning game that I learned from Twinkling Bunny!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_5,Am I doing a good job sweeping?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_6,There's still some trash left over there...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_7,Are you interested in being a maid sometime?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_8,Whoops!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_9,"Ah, got it! Teehee. I'll have to play the cleaning game again over there later."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_10,"Thanks for pointing that out, Rabbity!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_11,A maid?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_12,"If I were a maid, I could play cleaning games outside"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_13,with Twinkling Bunny and her friends.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_14,That'd be great!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_16_15,Alice and I play some cleaning games together.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_1,Seeing the Boss gets me so excited!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_2,He's such a wonderful
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_3,song and dance man!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_4,Mustang can sing?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_5,Oh yes! Would you like to have a listen?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_6,"No, that's okay."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_7,"Certainement, I'd like to listen."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_8,Why not?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_9,"The Boss is really good at singing,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_10,I promise!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_11,I'll ask him to sing for us sometime.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_12,"Whoa, you sound just like Boss!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_13,"Hehe, this is exciting!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_14,I'll go and ask him to sing for us right now!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_17_15,"I calm down the excited Alice, who's just about to run off in search of Mustang."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_1,"Golden Bunny's friend, Red Fan, told me"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_2,"that of all the things that shine bright, money shines the brightest."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_3,"Do you feel that way too, Rabbity?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_4,"Of course, nothing beats money."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_5,"Nope, snowflakes sparkle more."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_6,Is that so?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_7,"Personally, I feel that the Snow Queen's snowflakes are more sparkly,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_8,but I could be wrong...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_9,I think so too!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_10,Snow Queen's snowflakes are
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_11,so pretty and sparkly!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_18_12,Alice and I have a conversation about sparkly things.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_1,"Rabbity,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_2,what flavor of carrot could you really go for right now?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_3,I'm not in the mood for carrots right now.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_4,A cotton candy-flavored carrot.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_5,Huh? Why not?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_6,Do you not like carrots anymore?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_7,All the carrots in the world are gonna be so sad!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_8,!!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_9,"Wow, there's a flavor like that?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_10,Sounds scrumptious!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_19_11,Alice and I have a conversation about delicious carrots.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_1,Hippity hop!
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_2,Alice is hopping around by herself.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_3,"What are you up to, Alice?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_4,"Since I'm now a rabbit, I've been practicing my hopping."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_5,The only thing is that I can't seem to jump very high.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_6,That's because it's still early in your practice.
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_7,That's because you're a Nikke...
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_8,"You're right, it's probably because I haven't gotten enough practice in."
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_9,"Hehe, got it!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_10,"So long as I've got these rabbit ears and tail,"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_11,"one day, I'll be able to hop hiiiiiigh in the sky!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_12,"Isn't that right, Rabbity?"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_13,"Huh? No, no, no, I'm a rabbit!"
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_14,Can't you see these rabbit ears of mine?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_15,And my rabbit tail?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_16,Isn't it obvious that I'm a rabbit?
d_counseling_alice_wonderlandbunny_20_17,I join Alice in her hopping practice.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_1,"Mister, why do you keep staring at me like that?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_2,Do you really like my swimsuit that much?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_3,"Yeah, I love it."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_4,"It's all right, I guess."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_5,I appreciate your honesty.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_6,"I'm not going anywhere, so go ahead and keep looking."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_7,Feel free to snap a photo while you're at it.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_8,Would you like me to pose for you?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_9,You're not being honest with me.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_10,"You couldn't take your eyes off me earlier,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_11,and now you're acting like my swimsuit isn't much to look at?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_12,"That doesn't make much sense, does it?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_01_13,Rosanna and I have a conversation about the swimsuit she's wearing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_1,"Mmm, this is delicious."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_2,Would you like to try some?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_3,I made it myself.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_4,Take a sip.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_5,Down it in one gulp.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_6,*Sip*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_7,"Well, well, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_8,Seems you know your way around a drink.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_9,"The taste changes as the ice melts,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_10,so take your time and savor it slowly.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_11,*Gulp gulp gulp*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_12,Ahhhhh!
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_13,...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_14,Wow.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_15,I didn't think you'd down it in one shot.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_02_16,I chat with Rosanna while having a drink.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_1,"I know you're supposed to strike a pose for the camera,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_2,"but it's not really my thing,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_3,and I'm not sure what pose would suit me best.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_4,"Mind giving me your take on it, Mister?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_5,Rosanna shows me several poses.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_6,I think those cute poses really suit you.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_7,I think confident and sexy poses really suit you.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_8,... Mister.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_9,You can't be serious.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_10,"You're messing with me, aren't you?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_11,Just as I expected.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_12,"But hearing it from you, Mister,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_13,gives me even more confidence.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_14,"I'll have to practice those poses more often, then."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_03_15,I coach Rosanna on the types of poses that suit her.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_1,...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_2,Rosanna is carefully maintaining her surfboard with a serious expression.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_3,Talk to her.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_4,Wait for her.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_5,"Hey there, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_6,You finally made it?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_7,Give me a moment.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_8,I'm in the middle of something important.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_9,Soon after.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_10,"Did you wait for me, Mister?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_11,How commendable.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_12,Come here.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_13,I want to praise you for your thoughtfulness.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_04_14,Rosanna and I have a conversation on how to take care of surfboards.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_1,"Mister, don't you ever get bored being alone?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_2,Is there anything you'd like to do with me?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_3,Let's go surfing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_4,Let's build a sand castle.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_5,"I figured you'd be interested in that,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_6,so I brought an extra surfboard.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_7,Let's go!
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_8,"Today, we're going to get you riding a wave."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_9,What?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_10,You mean the thing Sakura's been obsessed with lately?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_11,... I am not really interested in that.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_12,Let's step out for a walk for now.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_05_13,Rosanna takes my hand and gently tugs me towards the beach.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_1,*Sigh* This isn't easy.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_2,"I've been giving Viper surfing lessons for days now,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_3,but her skills aren't improving at all.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_4,"Do you have any brilliant ideas, Mister?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_5,I could help you teach her.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_6,How about starting over with the basics?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_7,No.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_8,I can say with absolute certainty that that's the worst possible idea.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_9,"With you around, there's no way Viper can focus."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_11,But we started from the basics...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_12,Oh.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_13,I should start with teaching her how to balance on solid ground first.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_14,"Thanks for the advice, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_06_15,I listen to Rosanna complain about Viper for a while.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_1,What do you think is the most important aspect of surfing?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_2,Balance.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_3,Advanced tricks.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_4,"You really know your stuff, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_5,"It may seem easy, but it's not."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_6,You've gotta nail that balance
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_7,to start riding the waves.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_8,Huh?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_9,"You seem to enjoy showing off, huh?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_10,"Not that there's anything wrong with that,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_11,but there are more important things to consider.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_07_12,Rosanna and I continue to talk about surfing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_1,I'm having a tough time
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_2,getting used to this boisterous atmosphere.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_3,Want to take a stroll with me?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_4,You'll get used to it.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_5,Sure.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_6,I'm always open to invitations for a date.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_7,Where should we go?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_8,Do you have somewhere in mind?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_9,I seriously doubt it.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_10,I don't think I even want to get used to it.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_11,*Sigh*... Let's take a walk to clear our heads.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_08_12,Rosanna and I stroll around the island.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_1,Those fellas over there
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_2,have been fishing all day.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_3,"Don't they get bored, just doing that?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_4,Would you like to try it out yourself and see if it's boring or not?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_5,Don't you surf all day?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_6,I'll pass.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_7,Sitting around doing nothing and blankly staring at a fishing rod
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_8,doesn't exactly sound like my idea of fun.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_9,I'd only get antsy.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_10,I do. Why?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_11,That's essentially the same thing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_12,"Aaah,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_13,"so that's what they're into, huh?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_14,I still find it amazing that they get so much out of sitting around doing nothing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_09_15,Rosanna and I have a conversation about fishing.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_1,This sand is so annoying.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_2,It never comes off completely.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_3,Why don't you use something other than your hands?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_4,Why don't you wash it off with water?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_5,Like what?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_6,I proceed to use some talcum powder and a dry towel to brush off the sand.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_7,*Wipe wipe*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_8,Hmm?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_9,It came off so easily.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_10,I should have known you'd come up with something.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_11,"Thanks, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_12,I always take a shower
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_13,"when I get back to our accommodation,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_14,but I can never get them out completely.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_10_15,I help brush off the sand that's stuck on Rosanna.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_1,I had no idea Sakura brought a swimsuit like that with her.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_2,She must be awfully confident to wear something like that.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_3,"Yeah, it was pretty."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_4,Yours is more...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_5,Hmm?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_6,Really?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_7,Prettier than the one I'm wearing?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_8,Don't look away. Tell it to me straight.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_9,More what?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_10,Haha.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_11,Why's your face suddenly so red?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_12,"Oh, Mister, your reactions crack me up sometimes. You're adorable."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_11_13,Rosanna and I talk about Sakura's swimsuit.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_1,"Look at this, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_2,It's a seashell.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_3,"I ran into Mary by the beach earlier, and she gave it to me."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_4,"She said that if you put it up to your ear, you can hear the ocean."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_5,Don't tell me you actually believed that?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_6,Isn't the sound of the waves nice?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_7,So it's not true?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_8,That's too bad...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_9,But...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_10,So she wasn't pulling my leg?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_11,Rosanna puts the shell to her ear.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_12,...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_13,"Yes,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_14,it sounds lovely.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_15,"It's not every day I get a gift, so I ought to take it with me."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_16,You know as well as I do that we can't just take things we find on the surface.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_17,I know.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_18,"As long as I'm careful though,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_19,there shouldn't be any issues.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_12_20,Rosanna examines the shell for a long time.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_1,Never imagined I'd lay eyes on the real ocean.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_2,Life is full of surprises.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_3,It sure is.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_4,It's even better since you're here.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_5,It's even better because all of us are here together.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_6,I feel the same.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_7,"I'm having a blast with you here, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_8,"Having the others around can be quite bothersome,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_9,but whatever.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_11,I'm not so sure I agree.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_12,"If at all possible, I would have preferred it to be just you and me."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_13_13,Rosanna and I enjoy the view of the ocean.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_1,"Mister,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_2,what type of ocean view appeals to you the most?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_3,The ocean on a sunny afternoon.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_4,The ocean at dusk.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_5,That's not bad at all.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_6,Perfect for hitting the waves.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_7,But it's not quite to my taste.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_8,"Heh, you do know a thing or two, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_9,I also find the view of the ocean at sunset absolutely captivating.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_10,It's so easy to
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_11,get sucked in by its beauty.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_14_12,Rosanna and I continue to talk about the ocean view.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_1,Did I overdo it with the surfing?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_2,I'm parched.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_3,"Do you have anything to drink, Mister?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_4,Hand her an iced drink.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_5,Hand her a cup of hot tea.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_6,"Ah,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_7,that hits the spot.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_8,"Thanks, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_9,?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_10,Are you kidding me with this?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_11,I'm not Sakura.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_15_12,Rosanna and I have a conversation about what drinks she enjoys.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_1,"Mister, what's got you so fixated?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_2,The rose tattoo on your hip.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_3,The rose tattoo on your arm.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_4,"Oh, this?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_5,It shows that I'm the boss of Hedonia.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_6,"My, my, how bold of you."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_7,Didn't think you'd be ogling at me.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_8,"Oh, this?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_9,It shows that I'm the boss of Hedonia.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_10,But is that the only one you've found?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_11,"I have more, you know."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_12,Why don't you try finding them too?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_16_13,Rosanna and I discuss the tattoos on her body.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_1,"Mister, can you help me apply sunscreen?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_2,There are a few places I can't reach myself.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_3,Apply sunscreen to her back and waist.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_4,Apply sunscreen to her thighs and calves.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_5,*Slather slather*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_6,That's it.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_7,Mmm...
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_8,That feels nice.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_9,Why don't you keep going and apply it to other areas?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_10,*Slather slather*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_11,"I already took care of those areas, Mister."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_12,I told you I need help with the areas I can't reach.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_13,Try again.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_17_14,I carefully apply more sunscreen.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_1,*Click*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_2,?!
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_3,"Hehe, you look so surprised. I like it."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_4,"Still, why don't you try smiling?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_5,Make a silly face.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_6,Flash a bright smile.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_7,*Click*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_8,"Hmm... That's a pretty goofy expression, even for you."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_9,"Still, it could come in handy."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_10,I can use it to scare the others away and prevent them from clinging to you.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_11,*Click*
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_12,Tee-hee.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_13,"Mister, why do you look so awkward when you smile?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_14,"This one looks awfully cute, though."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_15,I think I'll use it as my phone background.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_16,"W-wait, I was just messing around!"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_17,Take another one!
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_18_18,Rosanna and I have an impromptu photoshoot.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_1,You know the girl who's like a puppy and always follows Viper around?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_2,She never seems to get tired.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_3,Maybe she's born that way.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_4,Maybe she's really a puppy.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_5,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_6,Her athleticism is nothing to scoff at either.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_7,To be born with such vivaciousness... Fascinating.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_8,... Mister.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_9,I'll pretend I didn't hear that joke.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_10,"Next time, try something less hackneyed."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_19_11,Rosanna and I watch Jackal tirelessly run on the beach.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_1,"Mister,"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_2,how would you describe our current situation at the beach in one word?
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_3,Happiness.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_4,Peace.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_5,Hmm... You're right.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_6,You do look happy.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_7,"I will say that my thoughts are slightly different, though."
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_8,Ah.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_9,"Yes, exactly!"
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_10,It's so peaceful here
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_11,that I sometimes feel like I'm dreaming.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_12,I didn't think it was possible for me to ever feel this way.
d_counseling_rosanna_chicocean_20_13,I spend a peaceful moment with Rosanna.
d_counseling_clay_01_1,"Come on, Coach, say it with me!"
d_counseling_clay_01_2,Put your hands together!
d_counseling_clay_01_3,Go! Go! Victory!
d_counseling_clay_01_4,You can do it!
d_counseling_clay_01_5,You can't do it!
d_counseling_clay_01_6,"Everyone, clap your hands!"
d_counseling_clay_01_7,"I knew you'd remember that, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_01_8,That's fantastic!
d_counseling_clay_01_9,...
d_counseling_clay_01_10,Coach... is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
d_counseling_clay_01_11,"Er... Yeah, I'm just kidding."
d_counseling_clay_01_12,I shout cheers and chants with Clay.
d_counseling_clay_02_1,"When people get cheered on, some get nervous,"
d_counseling_clay_02_2,while others feel reassured.
d_counseling_clay_02_3,"Which one are you, Coach?"
d_counseling_clay_02_4,I get nervous.
d_counseling_clay_02_5,I feel reassured.
d_counseling_clay_02_6,R-really?!
d_counseling_clay_02_7,...
d_counseling_clay_02_8,I'll have to be careful if I ever need to cheer for you then...
d_counseling_clay_02_9,"Hehe, really?"
d_counseling_clay_02_10,"Whenever you need a boost,"
d_counseling_clay_02_11,just give me a shout!
d_counseling_clay_02_12,Clay and I have a conversation about cheerleading.
d_counseling_clay_03_1,"Whenever I catch myself missing the beat,"
d_counseling_clay_03_2,I start to wonder if I'm just getting in Bay's way.
d_counseling_clay_03_3,What do you do when you start doubting yourself?
d_counseling_clay_03_4,I work hard to overcome it.
d_counseling_clay_03_5,I focus more on what I know I can do well.
d_counseling_clay_03_6,I... I see.
d_counseling_clay_03_7,"In that case, I'll try harder to stay on beat!"
d_counseling_clay_03_8,I can help too.
d_counseling_clay_03_9,...!
d_counseling_clay_03_10,You're right!
d_counseling_clay_03_11,"Bay is good at cheerleading, and you've got incredible showmanship."
d_counseling_clay_03_12,"Hehe, thanks, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_03_13,I don't feel so anxious anymore!
d_counseling_clay_03_14,Clay and I have a conversation about overcoming our weaknesses.
d_counseling_clay_04_1,"Ever since I joined Rewind, I feel like I've been living in a dream!"
d_counseling_clay_04_2,"Have you felt that way before, Coach?"
d_counseling_clay_04_3,"Yeah, all the time."
d_counseling_clay_04_4,Let me see... Not really.
d_counseling_clay_04_5,That's because I get to work with awesome people like you.
d_counseling_clay_04_6,...!
d_counseling_clay_04_7,Coach...
d_counseling_clay_04_8,"As expected, Coach, you are a good person...!"
d_counseling_clay_04_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_clay_04_10,I hope your dreams will come true soon...
d_counseling_clay_04_11,Me too. I'll keep at it.
d_counseling_clay_04_12,I'll definitely be cheering for you all the way!
d_counseling_clay_04_13,Clay and I talk more about our dreams.
d_counseling_clay_05_1,"When I arrive at the Commander's Room, I find Clay hesitantly looking at her phone."
d_counseling_clay_05_2,"What are you up to, Clay?"
d_counseling_clay_05_3,"Oh, hey, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_05_4,"We actually didn't do too well in a recent competition, so now I'm kinda scared to check the internet or the news..."
d_counseling_clay_05_5,"But at the same time, I feel that feedback could be helpful, so I should take a look... right?"
d_counseling_clay_05_6,Turn off all your devices and enjoy some me time.
d_counseling_clay_05_7,"We've got to accept all the feedback we're given, both good and bad."
d_counseling_clay_05_8,You know better than anyone else what areas need improvement.
d_counseling_clay_05_9,You... You're right!
d_counseling_clay_05_10,"From now on, I've gotta make time to reflect upon myself!"
d_counseling_clay_05_11,Yeah... But there are so many negative comments.
d_counseling_clay_05_12,"No pain, no gain I guess..."
d_counseling_clay_05_13,Clay and I talk more about how to come to terms with public opinion.
d_counseling_clay_06_1,I stayed up late practicing last night and ended up oversleeping.
d_counseling_clay_06_2,Do you have any good idea I can use to get up on time?
d_counseling_clay_06_3,What about sleeping in the practice room?
d_counseling_clay_06_4,Set multiple alarms every 5 minutes.
d_counseling_clay_06_5,That's a great idea!
d_counseling_clay_06_6,There's even a shower in the practice room!
d_counseling_clay_06_7,"If I stay there, I definitely won't have to worry about oversleeping."
d_counseling_clay_06_8,"Still, the best solution is not to put yourself in situations where you end up pulling all-nighters."
d_counseling_clay_06_9,I know... I'll try not to stay up too late from now on!
d_counseling_clay_06_10,"That's what I've been doing,"
d_counseling_clay_06_11,"but whenever I'm super tired, I just can't hear the alarm."
d_counseling_clay_06_12,There must be a better way...
d_counseling_clay_06_13,Clay and I think of ways to prevent her from oversleeping.
d_counseling_clay_07_1,Urgh...
d_counseling_clay_07_2,Bay seems to have a lot on her mind...
d_counseling_clay_07_3,Like what?
d_counseling_clay_07_4,It must have to do with Rewind's reputation not being what it used to...
d_counseling_clay_07_5,Reputation isn't everything.
d_counseling_clay_07_6,That's okay. You both can build it back up again.
d_counseling_clay_07_7,D-do you really think so?
d_counseling_clay_07_8,"But getting more popular means more offers come in, too..."
d_counseling_clay_07_9,"Otherwise, how can we continue?"
d_counseling_clay_07_10,"Hehe, I guess you're right about that!"
d_counseling_clay_07_11,"As long as I've got Bay, we'll be able to rehabilitate Rewind's reputation, no problem!"
d_counseling_clay_07_12,Clay and I talk more about Rewind's reputation.
d_counseling_clay_08_1,"I just performed at a small festival held at a senior center,"
d_counseling_clay_08_2,but the audience response was a bit... lukewarm.
d_counseling_clay_08_3,Do you think I did anything wrong?
d_counseling_clay_08_4,Older folks may find it difficult to respond enthusiastically.
d_counseling_clay_08_5,Perhaps it's because the audience was smaller?
d_counseling_clay_08_6,"Oh, I see!"
d_counseling_clay_08_7,"That makes me feel a lot better, hehe!"
d_counseling_clay_08_8,I dunno... every seat in the place was occupied...
d_counseling_clay_08_9,Do you think it's because they didn't like my routine?
d_counseling_clay_08_10,Clay and I continue to analyze the audience's reaction.
d_counseling_clay_09_1,*Sniffle*
d_counseling_clay_09_2,Clay is crying in the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_clay_09_3,"What's wrong, Clay?"
d_counseling_clay_09_4,I kept missing the beat today and messed up our whole routine.
d_counseling_clay_09_5,Just keep practicing so you won't make mistakes in the future.
d_counseling_clay_09_6,Everyone makes mistakes.
d_counseling_clay_09_7,"I'm up late every night practicing, but I don't feel like I'm getting any better."
d_counseling_clay_09_8,It's so frustrating!
d_counseling_clay_09_9,How about recording yourself so that you can get a better idea of what mistakes you're making?
d_counseling_clay_09_10,The important thing is how you handle it afterward.
d_counseling_clay_09_11,Y-you're right!
d_counseling_clay_09_12,I should get a better idea of what mistakes I'm making.
d_counseling_clay_09_13,"Thanks, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_09_14,Clay and I talk about what she should do to avoid making mistakes.
d_counseling_clay_10_1,...
d_counseling_clay_10_2,Clay is staring at me intently.
d_counseling_clay_10_3,"Whenever I'm with you, I feel like I've got someone in my corner!"
d_counseling_clay_10_4,"Maybe you've got an innate talent for cheerleading, Coach."
d_counseling_clay_10_5,I do like encouraging others.
d_counseling_clay_10_6,I'd feel a bit awkward doing cheerleading myself.
d_counseling_clay_10_7,I'm not surprised to hear you say that.
d_counseling_clay_10_8,"You may not be a cheerleader,"
d_counseling_clay_10_9,but there's something about you that motivates me!
d_counseling_clay_10_10,Oh... I see.
d_counseling_clay_10_11,"Still, just you being around is enough to give me strength,"
d_counseling_clay_10_12,so you ought to have a bit more confidence in yourself!
d_counseling_clay_10_13,Clay and I talk more about me and my ability to motivate her.
d_counseling_clay_11_1,"Hey, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_11_2,I practiced all day yesterday for the competition.
d_counseling_clay_11_3,Wanna take a look?
d_counseling_clay_11_4,"Sure, show me."
d_counseling_clay_11_5,I'd rather watch the final performance at the stadium myself.
d_counseling_clay_11_6,"Hehe, okay! I can give you a sneak peek right here!"
d_counseling_clay_11_7,"Clay moves to ready herself, then looks around the room."
d_counseling_clay_11_8,"Hmm... If I do it here, the furniture might get damaged!"
d_counseling_clay_11_9,Can we move to the practice room?
d_counseling_clay_11_10,"Sure, let's go."
d_counseling_clay_11_11,"Oh, okay... then you have to be sure to come on that day!"
d_counseling_clay_11_12,I'll be there.
d_counseling_clay_11_13,I promise Clay that I'll go watch her new and improved routine.
d_counseling_clay_12_1,"Coach, do you consider yourself a good dancer?"
d_counseling_clay_12_2,"Come to think of it, I've never seen you dance!"
d_counseling_clay_12_3,I think I'm pretty decent.
d_counseling_clay_12_4,I've got two left feet.
d_counseling_clay_12_5,"Whoa, really? Could you show me?"
d_counseling_clay_12_6,I do a dance that I saw on TV recently.
d_counseling_clay_12_7,What do you think?
d_counseling_clay_12_8,"Wow, you really are a great dancer!"
d_counseling_clay_12_9,"Hehe, don't worry, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_12_10,Let me teach you something I learned from Bay recently!
d_counseling_clay_12_11,"Okay, thanks."
d_counseling_clay_12_12,I do a simple dance in front of Clay.
d_counseling_clay_13_1,Someone I work with asked me
d_counseling_clay_13_2,why I end so many of my sentences with exclamation marks!
d_counseling_clay_13_3,"Do you think I use them too often, Coach?"
d_counseling_clay_13_4,I think you're okay!!! Totally!!!
d_counseling_clay_13_5,Everyone has their own way of speaking.
d_counseling_clay_13_6,... Are you making fun of me right now?
d_counseling_clay_13_7,"No, no! I was just being silly."
d_counseling_clay_13_8,I didn't realize you have a silly side to you...
d_counseling_clay_13_9,That's what I said to them!
d_counseling_clay_13_10,I knew you would understand!
d_counseling_clay_13_11,"So you see, there's no need for you to feel down."
d_counseling_clay_13_12,"Hehe, thanks, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_13_13,Clay and I have a conversation about the way she speaks.
d_counseling_clay_14_1,"No matter how hard I try,"
d_counseling_clay_14_2,I can't seem to stay on beat...
d_counseling_clay_14_3,How can I train my sense of rhythm?
d_counseling_clay_14_4,Try clapping to the beat of the song I'll play.
d_counseling_clay_14_5,How about playing a rhythm game?
d_counseling_clay_14_6,Y-you want me to do it right now?
d_counseling_clay_14_7,I start playing a song.
d_counseling_clay_14_8,*Clap clap clap*... *Clap* Ah!
d_counseling_clay_14_9,Let's try it again.
d_counseling_clay_14_10,Okay! I won't give up!
d_counseling_clay_14_11,"I've tried that a few times already,"
d_counseling_clay_14_12,but I kept messing up and the game wouldn't let me continue...
d_counseling_clay_14_13,I work together with Clay to hone her sense of rhythm.
d_counseling_clay_15_1,Coach!
d_counseling_clay_15_2,Who do you think
d_counseling_clay_15_3,would be a good new member for Rewind?
d_counseling_clay_15_4,Someone cool and composed.
d_counseling_clay_15_5,Someone passionate and energetic.
d_counseling_clay_15_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_clay_15_7,"I dunno, I think someone with some energy might be better!"
d_counseling_clay_15_8,"Wow, that sounds great!"
d_counseling_clay_15_9,I feel like I'd get a big energy boost just from being around someone like that!
d_counseling_clay_15_10,I'm sure we'd have a great time cheerleading together!
d_counseling_clay_15_11,Clay and I discuss what a potential new member of Rewind would look like.
d_counseling_clay_16_1,"Whenever I'm out cheering at all these different sports events,"
d_counseling_clay_16_2,it breaks my heart whenever I see how torn up the losing teams are.
d_counseling_clay_16_3,Do you think there's anything I could do for them?
d_counseling_clay_16_4,It might be best to give them some space and let them compose themselves.
d_counseling_clay_16_5,How about rooting for the losing team?
d_counseling_clay_16_6,Hm... I don't know...
d_counseling_clay_16_7,"If I were them, I feel like I'd want someone cheering me on."
d_counseling_clay_16_8,"'Cause, you know, once the game's over, no one ever notices the losing side..."
d_counseling_clay_16_9,"Wow, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_clay_16_10,I'll cheer them on with all my might and help them get back on their feet!
d_counseling_clay_16_11,Clay and I exchange ideas on rooting for the loosing side.
d_counseling_clay_17_1,There's a competition coming up in a few days where I'll be participating as a representative of Rewind.
d_counseling_clay_17_2,It's all been so last minute that I haven't had much time to practice.
d_counseling_clay_17_3,Do you think I'll do okay without Bay?
d_counseling_clay_17_4,"Just do what you always do, and keep your head held high."
d_counseling_clay_17_5,"If you haven't put in the time, you can't expect a miracle."
d_counseling_clay_17_6,I will!
d_counseling_clay_17_7,I'll put my best foot forward!
d_counseling_clay_17_8,"Thanks for the encouragement, Coach. I already feel more at ease!"
d_counseling_clay_17_9,I-is that so?
d_counseling_clay_17_10,"If I thought I could win without practicing, it might be disrespectful to those who've put in the effort..."
d_counseling_clay_17_11,Guess I'll just have to give it my all with the time I've got left...
d_counseling_clay_17_12,Clay continues to tell me her worries about the upcoming competition.
d_counseling_clay_18_1,"Coach, do you think hard work and tenacity can beat natural talent?"
d_counseling_clay_18_2,It's something that often crosses my mind while I'm watching sports matches.
d_counseling_clay_18_3,I don't think effort means much in the face of overwhelming talent.
d_counseling_clay_18_4,"If you try hard enough, nothing is impossible."
d_counseling_clay_18_5,Yeah... I kind of suspected that was the case.
d_counseling_clay_18_6,Still... I'll cheer them on just as hard as I always have!
d_counseling_clay_18_7,I want them to know that their effort has meaning!
d_counseling_clay_18_8,I knew it!
d_counseling_clay_18_9,I really hope everyone gets amazing results from all their hard work!
d_counseling_clay_18_10,"As for me, I'll cheer them on just as hard as I always have!"
d_counseling_clay_18_11,Clay and I have a conversation about the difference between effort and talent.
d_counseling_clay_19_1,"Coach, look at this!"
d_counseling_clay_19_2,I got a gift from a fan!
d_counseling_clay_19_3,"I want to repay them somehow, but I don't know how."
d_counseling_clay_19_4,How about making and selling some merch?
d_counseling_clay_19_5,How about writing them a letter?
d_counseling_clay_19_6,But I really want to convey my gratitude to my fans...
d_counseling_clay_19_7,"Surely, there's a better way of doing that?"
d_counseling_clay_19_8,"Hey, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_clay_19_9,I'd love to write one with loads of gratitude!
d_counseling_clay_19_10,Can I sit here and start writing it now?
d_counseling_clay_19_11,Clay and I discuss different ways to give back to her fans.
d_counseling_clay_20_1,There's nothing better than working up a sweat while cheerleading!
d_counseling_clay_20_2,"Do you like breaking a sweat, Coach?"
d_counseling_clay_20_3,"Yes, it's proof of how hard I'm working."
d_counseling_clay_20_4,"No, it makes me feel uncomfortable."
d_counseling_clay_20_5,That's exactly how I feel!
d_counseling_clay_20_6,That's why I feel super proud of myself when I work up a good sweat!
d_counseling_clay_20_7,And nothing beats showering after sweating it out.
d_counseling_clay_20_8,"Hehe, I see you really know your stuff, Coach!"
d_counseling_clay_20_9,Oh... really?
d_counseling_clay_20_10,I guess you're right... Sweat can feel so sticky and uncomfortable sometimes!
d_counseling_clay_20_11,Clay and I talk more about sweating.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_1,"If you could create only one thing with sand,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_2,what would you make?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_3,A bust of you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_4,A model of the Seimeikai mansion.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_5,Me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_6,Can I take this to mean that you consider my face a work of art?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_7,Hehe.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_8,The Seimeikai mansion?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_9,That's a rather unexpected answer.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_10,I thought you'd choose something you had more of a personal connection to.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_01_11,I spend some meaningful time with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_1,Sakura is fiddling with a camera.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_2,There's only one shot left on this roll.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_3,"Can I take a picture of you, {AccountData.NickName}-kun?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_4,I'd prefer to take a picture with you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_5,Strike a pose.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_6,"Now that you mention it, I don't think I have any photos of just you and me."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_7,"Then, I shall move closer."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_8,What kind of photo would you like to take?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_9,"Hehe, I would have regretted not taking it."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_10,Would you like to do another pose?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_11,I can't quite see your face right now.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_02_12,Sakura and I take a plethora of photos together.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_1,"Since this is our first time at the beach together,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_2,I feel that I should call you by a different name.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_3,What should I call you?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_4,Honey?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_5,{AccountData.NickName}?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_6,Isn't that what Viper calls you?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_7,I don't want to refer to you by the same nickname.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_8,Isn't there anything else?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_10,I don't believe I've ever called you just by your name.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_11,I suppose I can try...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_12,{AccountData.NickName}...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_13,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_14,Strange... why do I feel so flush all of a sudden?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_03_15,Sakura and I talk about nicknames.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_1,"Should I depart from this place, I fear I shall dearly miss it."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_2,"During your time here, what has brought you the greatest delight?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_3,Everything I did with you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_4,Let me think for a moment.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_5,I also enjoyed the time we spent together.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_6,"As each summer approaches,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_7,I shall find myself reminiscing about the summer spent in your company.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_8,I understand.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_9,"You've done so much during your time here,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_10,I can see why you'd need a while to think about it.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_04_11,Sakura and I have a productive counseling session.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_1,"During the barbecue,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_2,I spilled some sauce on my robe.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_4,Take it off.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_5,I'll wash it for you. You can wear my shirt in the meantime.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_6,"No, I'd feel naked without my robe."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_7,I'll try to clean it with some water first.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_8,"Hehe, I appreciate you saying that."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_9,I absolutely adore this sweeter side of you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_10,It only increases my desire to make you completely mine.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_05_11,I spend some meaningful time with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_1,"Although Rosanna's swimsuit isn't quite to my taste,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_2,I must admit
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_3,it exudes both boldness and charisma.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_4,"Personally, I prefer your swimsuit."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_5,"Yeah, I love it."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_6,"Hehe, so you like my swimsuit more?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_7,That makes me really happy.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_8,"The more I think about it, the more I think we share the same preferences."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_9,"Hmm... So that is your preference, I see."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_10,I understand.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_11,"You're referring to the swimsuit, correct? Not Rosanna herself?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_06_12,Sakura and I have a conversation about swimsuits.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_1,"I'm worried that once we head back to the Ark,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_2,I'll start missing the ocean.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_3,It's also a shame that I won't be able to wear this swimsuit anymore.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_4,We can go to a pool.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_5,Let's come back next summer.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_6,... But a swimming pool
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_7,isn't the same as an open ocean.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_8,"Well, I guess I'll have to make do with the pool."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_9,Absolutely.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_10,I'd love nothing more
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_11,than to go to the beach with you again.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_12,I'm already looking forward to the next summer.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_07_13,Sakura and I have a productive counseling session.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_1,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_2,Sakura doesn't seem to have noticed my arrival.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_3,*Knock knock*
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_4,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_5,!!
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_6,"Sorry, did I startle you?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_7,Yes.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_8,I was lost in my own thoughts for a moment
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_9,and didn't realize you were here.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_10,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_11,Why aren't you saying anything?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_12,I didn't want to disturb you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_13,"Hehe, you're such a sweetie."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_14,... Thank you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_08_15,Sakura and I have a productive counseling session.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_1,Use background Beach_n.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_2,The sea is especially beautiful at night.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_3,"If you have time,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_4,would you like to have a drink with me in the moonlight?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_5,How about a kiss?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_6,I'll prepare the drinks.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_7,... What?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_8,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_9,Do you say things like this to the others as well?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_10,That won't be necessary.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_11,I've prepared a special drink for the occasion.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_12,"Come then, let's have a drink together."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_09_13,I have a pleasant time with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_1,Mary gave me some new lip gloss today.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_2,"Not only is it moisturizing, but it also has a wonderful scent."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_3,Would you like some?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_4,Only if you apply it for me.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_5,"No, thanks. I'm good."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_6,... Me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_7,"Okay, fine."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_8,"Why don't you come a little closer, then?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_9,... Just a little more.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_10,Would you perhaps consider applying a little?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_11,"If your lips are too dry, they're liable to crack."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_10_12,Sakura and I spend the time applying some lip gloss.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_1,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_2,Sakura is glancing at her phone with a look of consternation.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_3,Is something wrong?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_4,I'm picking out pictures to show Moran when I get back to the Ark.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_5,Which pictures would you suggest I show her?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_6,Pictures of the ocean.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_7,Pictures of sand castles.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_8,"Indeed, there's nothing quite as splendid as a picture of the ocean."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_9,I could show her all the pictures I took of the wildlife here:
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_10,"Dolphins, sea lions, and even flamingos."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_11,It'd be nice if she were to join us at the beach next time.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_12,I don't think Moran would be too interested in pictures of sand castles.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_13,I should find something else to show her.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_11_14,I spend time helping Sakura choose which pictures to show Moran.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_1,Guilty gave me some coconut juice earlier today.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_2,Have you tried it?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_3,It's not to my liking.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_4,It was absolutely delicious.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_5,Same here.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_6,"I'd be okay with never trying it again,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_7,but Guilty can't seem to get enough of that stuff.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_8,Really?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_9,"I'm not a big fan, personally."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_10,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_11,I guess everyone has their own preferences.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_12_12,Sakura and I have a conversation about coconut juice.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_1,"Here, I'd like for you to have this bracelet."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_2,I crafted it from seashells and conch shells...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_3,I hope you like it.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_4,I'll keep it as a memento.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_5,I'll wear it every day.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_6,"Rather than treating it as a memento,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_7,I would much prefer for you to wear it every day...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_8,Since I made it with you in mind.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_9,"Hehe, really?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_10,"It was worth all the effort, then."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_11,I added in various seashells and conch shells that I thought would suit you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_12,Hurry and put it on your wrist.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_13_13,Sakura and I have a conversation about the bracelet she made for me.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_1,Getting my picture taken
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_2,isn't something that comes naturally to me.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_3,What pose do you think suits me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_4,Something graceful and dignified.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_5,Something sexy and captivating.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_6,That strikes me as something I can manage quite easily.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_7,I'll try a pose so tell me what you think.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_8,"After all, I've no clue what I'm doing."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_10,"I must confess, I am rather uncertain as to what pose that is"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_11,since nothing comes to mind.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_12,Are you sure that's the type of pose that would suit me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_14_13,Sakura and I talk more about different types of poses.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_2,"you may not believe this,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_3,but I think I saw a ghost here yesterday.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_4,"Actually, I think that might have been me."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_5,"Don't worry, I'll protect you."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_6,... I see.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_7,"Frankly speaking, I'm not particularly afraid of ghosts."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_8,"In my opinion, humans are far more frightening."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_9,You will?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_10,That puts my mind at ease.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_11,"I shall do everything within my power to keep you safe,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_12,no matter what.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_15_13,Sakura and I have a conversation about ghosts.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_1,"I've decided to have a water fight with Rosanna later,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_2,and she's pretty confident that she'll win.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_3,"No way, you'll win."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_4,"Who knows, Rosanna might just beat you?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_5,"Hehe, glad to hear you're on my side."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_6,"Now that I have your support,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_7,I'm sure to win.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_8,...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_9,So that's how you feel...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_10,I understand.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_11,"... It seems I must defeat Rosanna, by any means necessary."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_16_12,Sakura and I have a conversation about water fights.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_1,"Take a look at this, {AccountData.NickName}-kun."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_2,I found this tiny turtle today while I was building a sand castle.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_3,Isn't it adorable?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_4,It looks just like you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_5,It's so cute.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_6,Me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_7,How so?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_8,What part do you think resembles me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_9,I'm glad you think so.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_10,"Rosanna and Viper didn't like it. In fact, they were grossed out by it."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_11,The way it dawdles about so slowly is simply adorable to behold.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_12,It sure would be nice if I was able to take this little guy with me back to the Ark.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_13,Oh well...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_17_14,Sakura and I have a conversation about turtles.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_1,We really got to enjoy the seaside a great deal while we were up here.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_2,"Of all the things we did here,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_3,what do you remember the most?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_4,Building sand castles with you.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_5,Surfing with Rosanna.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_6,That's my fondest memory as well.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_7,I didn't even realize how fast time was passing.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_8,"... There will be another day where we can build sand castles, won't there?"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_9,Really?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_10,"Personally, I despise physical activities,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_11,but it seems like you get a real kick out of them.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_18_12,I spend some meaningful time with Sakura.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_1,Phew...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_2,"Jackal asked me to teach her how to build a sand castle,"
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_3,but all she does is eat sand.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_4,What should I do?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_5,The easiest option would be to give up.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_6,Try mixing some of the bait you made into the sand.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_7,Giving up isn't in my vocabulary.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_8,I will get her to make the perfect sand castle if it's the last thing I do.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_9,There has to be a better method. I just have to think.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_10,Hmm... That's not a bad idea.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_11,Jackal does despise that bait...
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_12,I'll have to give it a try.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_19_13,Sakura and I have a conversation about Jackal.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_1,*Splash splash*
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_2,Sakura is splashing water with her feet.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_3,Join her and splash along.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_4,Splash her with water.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_5,"Haha, hey there."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_6,I find splashing water at the beach to be quite relaxing.
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_7,Care to join me?
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_8,Hey!
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_9,"I didn't want to get wet, so that's why I've only been dipping my toes in the water."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_10,"But thanks to you, I'm completely soaked now."
d_counseling_sakura_bloominsummer_20_11,I spend some meaningful time with Sakura.
d_counseling_ein_01_1,"Ugh, class is so boring!"
d_counseling_ein_01_2,I don't know how other people endure it.
d_counseling_ein_01_3,"Maybe they just grin and bear it, even though it's deathly boring."
d_counseling_ein_01_4,Maybe they actually enjoy being in class.
d_counseling_ein_01_5,I think you may be right.
d_counseling_ein_01_6,"Even if they don't say as much, I'm sure they must feel that way."
d_counseling_ein_01_7,"Whenever I look around during class, I always see a few people dozing off,"
d_counseling_ein_01_8,and many more doing all sorts of other things.
d_counseling_ein_01_9,"Argh, I really feel like I'm gonna die of boredom over here."
d_counseling_ein_01_10,*Gasp*! No way!
d_counseling_ein_01_11,There's no way people like that actually exist.
d_counseling_ein_01_12,Oh!
d_counseling_ein_01_13,Unless we're talking about a model student like Zwei.
d_counseling_ein_01_14,Ein explains how not to get caught slacking off during class.
d_counseling_ein_02_1,"Teacher, Teacher!"
d_counseling_ein_02_2,Give me your phone for a second.
d_counseling_ein_02_3,"Sorry, no can do."
d_counseling_ein_02_4,"Sure, here you go."
d_counseling_ein_02_5,"Aw, why not?"
d_counseling_ein_02_6,Not even for a moment?
d_counseling_ein_02_7,Come on! Please?
d_counseling_ein_02_8,I swear it'll only be for a moment.
d_counseling_ein_02_9,I'm curious about what kind of music you listen to.
d_counseling_ein_02_10,Woohoo!
d_counseling_ein_02_11,"Thanks, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_02_12,I can see you're curious why I asked for your phone.
d_counseling_ein_02_13,I'm curious as to what songs you've got on your playlist.
d_counseling_ein_02_14,"You don't have just old songs on there, do you?"
d_counseling_ein_02_15,Ein and I have a conversation about our favorite music.
d_counseling_ein_03_1,"Teacher, come here for a moment."
d_counseling_ein_03_2,"Now, smile."
d_counseling_ein_03_3,Smile broadly.
d_counseling_ein_03_4,Don't smile and look serious.
d_counseling_ein_03_5,"Wow, amazing!"
d_counseling_ein_03_6,"You're really handsome, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_03_7,"I thought the others were exaggerating a bit when they said how handsome you were,"
d_counseling_ein_03_8,but you're really dashing when you smile.
d_counseling_ein_03_9,Huh?
d_counseling_ein_03_10,What's with that face? I said smile.
d_counseling_ein_03_11,"Then again,"
d_counseling_ein_03_12,you actually look pretty good with a serious expression.
d_counseling_ein_03_13,You look like a professional model.
d_counseling_ein_03_14,Ein continues to compliment my appearance throughout the counseling session.
d_counseling_ein_04_1,Mhmm...
d_counseling_ein_04_2,Oh yeah!
d_counseling_ein_04_3,What's this song? You seem to really like it.
d_counseling_ein_04_4,Mhmm... oh yeah!
d_counseling_ein_04_5,*Gasp* You don't know this song?
d_counseling_ein_04_6,This song is at the top of the charts right now.
d_counseling_ein_04_7,It's been in a boatload of ads and videos.
d_counseling_ein_04_8,"I'm disappointed in you, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_04_9,I knew you'd be familiar with this song.
d_counseling_ein_04_10,Isn't the chorus out of this world?
d_counseling_ein_04_11,It's so catchy.
d_counseling_ein_04_12,I often find myself humming it without even realizing.
d_counseling_ein_04_13,Ein and I spend time listening to the song.
d_counseling_ein_05_1,"Ugh, I can't stand homework."
d_counseling_ein_05_2,It's got to be the most irritating thing in the world.
d_counseling_ein_05_3,"Can you help me out, Teacher?"
d_counseling_ein_05_4,"Okay, I'll help."
d_counseling_ein_05_5,Doesn't that defeat the purpose of homework?
d_counseling_ein_05_6,"Yes, score!"
d_counseling_ein_05_7,This is the part I'm stuck on.
d_counseling_ein_05_8,... This is the first page.
d_counseling_ein_05_9,"Yeah, and?"
d_counseling_ein_05_10,"I didn't start yet, hehe."
d_counseling_ein_05_11,Oh my gosh... déjà vu.
d_counseling_ein_05_12,That's exactly what Miss Marciana told me.
d_counseling_ein_05_13,"Honestly, whether I do it on my own or with someone helping me, it's the exact same thing."
d_counseling_ein_05_14,"So help me out, Teacher!"
d_counseling_ein_05_15,I help Ein with her homework.
d_counseling_ein_06_1,"Teacher, look at this."
d_counseling_ein_06_2,It's a photo I took of Rei dozing off in class earlier.
d_counseling_ein_06_3,Isn't she adorable?
d_counseling_ein_06_4,I just wanna eat her up.
d_counseling_ein_06_5,What a strange thing to say...
d_counseling_ein_06_6,I know what you mean. She's so cute.
d_counseling_ein_06_7,It's just an expression!
d_counseling_ein_06_8,It's not like I'm actually gonna start munching on her.
d_counseling_ein_06_9,"... Oh, actually..."
d_counseling_ein_06_10,"Come to think of it, I think I did bite her before."
d_counseling_ein_06_11,"Fine, I'll be more careful."
d_counseling_ein_06_12,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_ein_06_13,Especially her cheeks!
d_counseling_ein_06_14,"Whenever she wakes up from a nap, her cheeks are always beet red from resting on her desk."
d_counseling_ein_06_15,It's absolutely adorable.
d_counseling_ein_06_16,Nothing beats poking her squishy cheeks.
d_counseling_ein_06_17,*Sigh* I wish I could poke them now.
d_counseling_ein_06_18,Ein and I have a conversation about Rei.
d_counseling_ein_07_1,"I love Zwei,"
d_counseling_ein_07_2,but she can be really frustrating sometimes.
d_counseling_ein_07_3,Does it have to do with her being a model student?
d_counseling_ein_07_4,Oh? What do you mean?
d_counseling_ein_07_5,Exactly!
d_counseling_ein_07_6,She nags me relentlessly if I so much as break the most trivial rule.
d_counseling_ein_07_7,She acts like it's the end of the world if her grades drop the tiniest bit.
d_counseling_ein_07_8,Sometimes I feel that she's too tightly wound.
d_counseling_ein_07_9,"I thought you'd know what I was talking about, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_07_10,"To me, it feels like Zwei is a prisoner to expectations."
d_counseling_ein_07_11,She has to always be the model student of all model students.
d_counseling_ein_07_12,That causes her to behave in ways which can be frustrating sometimes.
d_counseling_ein_07_13,Ein and I have a conversation about Zwei.
d_counseling_ein_08_1,"Wow, look at this, Teacher!"
d_counseling_ein_08_2,I got my nails done. What do you think? I did it myself.
d_counseling_ein_08_3,Too many jewels for my liking.
d_counseling_ein_08_4,Very flashy. I like it.
d_counseling_ein_08_5,You think?
d_counseling_ein_08_6,"That style has been in vogue lately,"
d_counseling_ein_08_7,but I guess it's not your cup of tea.
d_counseling_ein_08_8,"I know, right? So sparkly!"
d_counseling_ein_08_9,I was asking you because I wasn't sure if I was going over the top with it.
d_counseling_ein_08_10,I'm glad that you like it too.
d_counseling_ein_08_11,"It was worth the effort, hehe!"
d_counseling_ein_08_12,I listen to Ein brag about her nails for a while.
d_counseling_ein_09_1,"H-hello, Rupee."
d_counseling_ein_09_2,Do you remember me?
d_counseling_ein_09_3,"No, that sounds way too timid."
d_counseling_ein_09_4,Dang it!
d_counseling_ein_09_5,"Ein is holding her phone, agonizing over a text."
d_counseling_ein_09_6,"Looking over her shoulder, I can see she's writing a message to Rupee."
d_counseling_ein_09_7,Give her advice on what to send.
d_counseling_ein_09_8,Say nothing.
d_counseling_ein_09_9,Teacher!
d_counseling_ein_09_10,You came just in time!
d_counseling_ein_09_11,I can't send this.
d_counseling_ein_09_12,I'm too nervous.
d_counseling_ein_09_13,Can you help me compose a message instead?
d_counseling_ein_09_14,Just don't come off too clingy or too formal!
d_counseling_ein_09_15,How have you been? I hope you're doing well.
d_counseling_ein_09_16,"No, that's too generic."
d_counseling_ein_09_17,"Oh, Teacher!"
d_counseling_ein_09_18,Why are you just standing there?
d_counseling_ein_09_19,Hurry up and sit over here. I've got something important I need your help with.
d_counseling_ein_09_20,"Ein agonizes over her text for a long time, but eventually decides not to contact Rupee."
d_counseling_ein_10_1,"Teacher, are you busy?"
d_counseling_ein_10_2,"Yeah, I'm busy."
d_counseling_ein_10_3,"No, I'm not busy."
d_counseling_ein_10_4,"Aw, that's too bad."
d_counseling_ein_10_5,I was planning on going somewhere fun.
d_counseling_ein_10_6,"But if you're busy, I guess that plan is out."
d_counseling_ein_10_7,Let's hurry and continue with our session.
d_counseling_ein_10_8,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_ein_10_9,"Why don't we go shopping together, then?"
d_counseling_ein_10_10,I'll pick out a nice outfit for you!
d_counseling_ein_10_11,Let's hurry and finish our session!
d_counseling_ein_10_12,I quickly finish my session with Ein.
d_counseling_ein_11_1,I wanna go to a karaoke bar!
d_counseling_ein_11_2,"What do you usually do when you go to a karaoke bar, Teacher?"
d_counseling_ein_11_3,The reason I ask is because you don't seem like the type to stand up and belt your heart out.
d_counseling_ein_11_4,"I love singing, so I never put the mic down."
d_counseling_ein_11_5,I help set the mood by shaking a tambourine.
d_counseling_ein_11_6,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_ein_11_7,I never expected that.
d_counseling_ein_11_8,You say you never put the microphone down?
d_counseling_ein_11_9,Sounds like I may have some competition!
d_counseling_ein_11_10,That's perfect.
d_counseling_ein_11_11,I really like people who play the tambourine.
d_counseling_ein_11_12,It feels a bit empty when it's just me singing alone.
d_counseling_ein_11_13,"Whenever I hear the tambourine, my heart starts to race!"
d_counseling_ein_11_14,"Let's go to karaoke together next time, Teacher!"
d_counseling_ein_11_15,Ein and I have a conversation about karaoke.
d_counseling_ein_12_1,"What are we going to talk about today, Teacher?"
d_counseling_ein_12_2,What about school?
d_counseling_ein_12_3,What about dreams?
d_counseling_ein_12_4,School? What's there to talk about?
d_counseling_ein_12_5,Class is boring.
d_counseling_ein_12_6,Homework is irritating.
d_counseling_ein_12_7,It can be fun at times because of my friends and classmates.
d_counseling_ein_12_8,What else is there?
d_counseling_ein_12_9,That's great!
d_counseling_ein_12_10,"You must be tired of hearing me say this by now,"
d_counseling_ein_12_11,but my dream is to become an exclusive designer for Rushae.
d_counseling_ein_12_12,"I'm going to make it a reality, no matter what I do!"
d_counseling_ein_12_13,I even started studying design!
d_counseling_ein_12_14,Ein and I spend some time talking about various things.
d_counseling_ein_13_1,"Teacher, I have big news!"
d_counseling_ein_13_2,Miss Marciana didn't check our homework today!
d_counseling_ein_13_3,"She's usually so strict, so for her to not check our homework... I thought I was dreaming!"
d_counseling_ein_13_4,Maybe the homework wasn't due today.
d_counseling_ein_13_5,You're right. You are dreaming right now.
d_counseling_ein_13_6,"Oh, really? No way..."
d_counseling_ein_13_7,*Gasp* Oh my gosh!
d_counseling_ein_13_8,The homework is due tomorrow.
d_counseling_ein_13_9,"How did you know, Teacher?"
d_counseling_ein_13_10,You're amazing.
d_counseling_ein_13_11,Hey!
d_counseling_ein_13_12,"I'm not a kid, you know?"
d_counseling_ein_13_13,Do you really think I'd fall for a childish joke like that?
d_counseling_ein_13_14,I help Ein finish her homework.
d_counseling_ein_14_1,Rupee is my favorite person.
d_counseling_ein_14_2,"What about you, Teacher?"
d_counseling_ein_14_3,It's a secret.
d_counseling_ein_14_4,You.
d_counseling_ein_14_5,Everything is a secret with you.
d_counseling_ein_14_6,"You're not too embarrassed to reveal your favorite, are you?"
d_counseling_ein_14_7,"Fine, let me guess."
d_counseling_ein_14_8,Zwei? Rei? Or Rupee as well?
d_counseling_ein_14_9,Huh? Me?
d_counseling_ein_14_10,"You're lying, aren't you?"
d_counseling_ein_14_11,Wait... you're not?
d_counseling_ein_14_12,Wh-what about me is...
d_counseling_ein_14_13,How can you be so brazen?! This is embarrassing!
d_counseling_ein_14_14,"Man, is it me, or it's getting hot in here?"
d_counseling_ein_14_15,Ein and I have a conversation about our favorite people.
d_counseling_ein_15_1,Phew... I'm drained.
d_counseling_ein_15_2,Maybe it's because I've been really hitting the books in class lately.
d_counseling_ein_15_3,How about we take a rest today?
d_counseling_ein_15_4,Why don't we go outside and hang out?
d_counseling_ein_15_5,That sounds great.
d_counseling_ein_15_6,Can I lie down on the sofa?
d_counseling_ein_15_7,"No way, I'm pooped."
d_counseling_ein_15_8,I don't have the energy to go gallivanting about now.
d_counseling_ein_15_9,Ein lies on the sofa.
d_counseling_ein_16_1,Isn't the weather lovely outside?
d_counseling_ein_16_2,It's a perfect day for skipping school and hanging out outside.
d_counseling_ein_16_3,"Be that as it may, you should still go to school."
d_counseling_ein_16_4,Why don't we hang out after school?
d_counseling_ein_16_5,"I know, I know. I will."
d_counseling_ein_16_6,I wasn't really planning on playing hooky.
d_counseling_ein_16_7,*Gasp* Really?
d_counseling_ein_16_8,Yay! Where should we go?
d_counseling_ein_16_9,"But skipping school is a big no-no, right?"
d_counseling_ein_16_10,I really shouldn't joke about these things.
d_counseling_ein_16_11,Ein eventually makes it to school on time.
d_counseling_ein_17_1,Hey Teacher.
d_counseling_ein_17_2,Don't you think Naga and Tia are a bit unusual?
d_counseling_ein_17_3,You mean because they always stick together?
d_counseling_ein_17_4,You mean because they're so obsessed with desserts and accessories?
d_counseling_ein_17_5,"Yes, exactly!"
d_counseling_ein_17_6,I don't think
d_counseling_ein_17_7,I've ever seen them be apart.
d_counseling_ein_17_8,They must have been close in their past life.
d_counseling_ein_17_9,Huh?
d_counseling_ein_17_10,How's that strange?
d_counseling_ein_17_11,Everyone's into different things. That's totally fine.
d_counseling_ein_17_12,Ein and I have a conversation about Naga and Tia.
d_counseling_ein_18_1,"Teacher, let's make a bet!"
d_counseling_ein_18_2,Who can type a message faster and more accurately without looking at the screen?
d_counseling_ein_18_3,"No, I don't want to."
d_counseling_ein_18_4,"Okay, let's do it."
d_counseling_ein_18_5,Why not?
d_counseling_ein_18_6,I'm confident that I'll win!
d_counseling_ein_18_7,"Let's try it just once, pleaaaaase?"
d_counseling_ein_18_8,Alright!
d_counseling_ein_18_9,"Then, get ready!"
d_counseling_ein_18_10,Go!
d_counseling_ein_18_11,*Tadadadadadak* *Ding*
d_counseling_ein_18_12,Yes! I won!
d_counseling_ein_18_13,Ein gives me tips on how to type quickly on the phone.
d_counseling_ein_19_1,I bumped into Tia at the dessert shop earlier.
d_counseling_ein_19_2,She was buying more than 20 slices of cake.
d_counseling_ein_19_3,How can she pack away that many sweets?
d_counseling_ein_19_4,She has a separate stomach for desserts.
d_counseling_ein_19_5,You should ask her yourself.
d_counseling_ein_19_6,Huh?
d_counseling_ein_19_7,"Now that I think about it,"
d_counseling_ein_19_8,I'm pretty sure she said something along those lines.
d_counseling_ein_19_9,Fascinating!
d_counseling_ein_19_10,I did!
d_counseling_ein_19_11,... But I forget what her answer was.
d_counseling_ein_19_12,Ein and I have a conversation about what desserts we like.
d_counseling_ein_20_1,"Here, take this, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_20_2,It's a snack Rei gave me.
d_counseling_ein_20_3,I left some for you.
d_counseling_ein_20_4,Thanks.
d_counseling_ein_20_5,"No thanks, I'm fine. I'm full."
d_counseling_ein_20_6,No need to thank me.
d_counseling_ein_20_7,"The snacks Rei gives out are always super delicious,"
d_counseling_ein_20_8,so I wanted you to try some.
d_counseling_ein_20_9,"Here, then take this."
d_counseling_ein_20_10,This one is smaller than the others.
d_counseling_ein_20_11,Just take one.
d_counseling_ein_20_12,"I brought them specially for you, Teacher."
d_counseling_ein_20_13,Ein and I indulge in some snacks.
d_counseling_zwei_01_1,My grades have really plummeted.
d_counseling_zwei_01_2,What do you think I've been doing wrong?
d_counseling_zwei_01_3,Maybe you haven't gotten proper rest.
d_counseling_zwei_01_4,Maybe you haven't been studying enough.
d_counseling_zwei_01_5,I'm not following.
d_counseling_zwei_01_6,"If you want to get good grades, it's essential to get plenty of rest."
d_counseling_zwei_01_7,Oh... I see.
d_counseling_zwei_01_8,You're right.
d_counseling_zwei_01_9,"Now that I think about it, I may not have been getting as much rest as I could have been."
d_counseling_zwei_01_10,"Thanks for the reminder, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_01_11,"I've been studying every day, and it's still not enough? Good grief."
d_counseling_zwei_01_12,"At this rate, I'll have to stay up all night."
d_counseling_zwei_01_13,I guess I've been too complacent.
d_counseling_zwei_01_14,Zwei looks at her report card and is morose throughout the counseling session.
d_counseling_zwei_02_1,...
d_counseling_zwei_02_2,Zwei is looking at her tablet and concentrating.
d_counseling_zwei_02_3,Talk to her.
d_counseling_zwei_02_4,Don't talk to her.
d_counseling_zwei_02_5,"Oh, hi, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_02_6,I was memorizing some important information that's likely to be on the next exam.
d_counseling_zwei_02_7,Just a moment.
d_counseling_zwei_02_8,After a while.
d_counseling_zwei_02_9,"Oh, hi, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_02_10,I just finished previewing some things.
d_counseling_zwei_02_11,Thanks for being patient and waiting.
d_counseling_zwei_02_12,It helped me focus.
d_counseling_zwei_02_13,Zwei and I have a conversation about her upcoming exam.
d_counseling_zwei_03_1,"Do you have any aspirations, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_03_2,"Of course, I do."
d_counseling_zwei_03_3,"No, not really."
d_counseling_zwei_03_4,... I see.
d_counseling_zwei_03_5,I guess that's only natural for someone like you.
d_counseling_zwei_03_6,That's unexpected.
d_counseling_zwei_03_7,I thought for sure that someone like you would have hopes and dreams.
d_counseling_zwei_03_8,"Strangely enough, that actually makes me feel relieved."
d_counseling_zwei_03_9,It means you're just like me.
d_counseling_zwei_03_10,Zwei and I talk about aspirations and what they mean.
d_counseling_zwei_04_1,"What do you do whenever you're nervous, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_04_2,I do simple stretches.
d_counseling_zwei_04_3,I just grin and bear it in hopes that it will pass.
d_counseling_zwei_04_4,Stretching?
d_counseling_zwei_04_5,Does that really help with relieving anxiety?
d_counseling_zwei_04_6,Of course.
d_counseling_zwei_04_7,What kind of stretches do you do?
d_counseling_zwei_04_8,Can you teach me a couple?
d_counseling_zwei_04_9,I do the same thing.
d_counseling_zwei_04_10,But it doesn't seem to work...
d_counseling_zwei_04_11,I give Zwei some advice on how to relieve tension.
d_counseling_zwei_05_1,We're having a shorter class today.
d_counseling_zwei_05_2,What should I do with the extra time?
d_counseling_zwei_05_3,You should study.
d_counseling_zwei_05_4,How about hanging out with friends?
d_counseling_zwei_05_5,I suppose you're right.
d_counseling_zwei_05_6,"A shortened class means that we won't learn as much,"
d_counseling_zwei_05_7,so I figured I might as well fill that time with additional studying.
d_counseling_zwei_05_8,But my friends said that's weird...
d_counseling_zwei_05_9,I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way.
d_counseling_zwei_05_10,Go out with my friends?
d_counseling_zwei_05_11,Shouldn't I be studying whatever we didn't cover in class today?
d_counseling_zwei_05_12,Is going outside and goofing off really a good idea?
d_counseling_zwei_05_13,Zwei heads to school earlier than usual.
d_counseling_zwei_06_1,"I was studying during break time,"
d_counseling_zwei_06_2,but Ein said I should actually take it easy during break time.
d_counseling_zwei_06_3,What does she mean by that?
d_counseling_zwei_06_4,Actually taking a break and relaxing.
d_counseling_zwei_06_5,"Taking a nap like Rei, or playing around like Ein."
d_counseling_zwei_06_6,Huh?
d_counseling_zwei_06_7,All I was doing was a bit of light studying.
d_counseling_zwei_06_8,"To me, that was taking it easy... isn't it?"
d_counseling_zwei_06_9,"Oh, so that's what they meant."
d_counseling_zwei_06_10,"Hmm... for me, I think it's a little different."
d_counseling_zwei_06_11,I like sleeping in bed.
d_counseling_zwei_06_12,And I like having fun outside of school.
d_counseling_zwei_06_13,"Still, that answers my previous question, so thanks for telling me."
d_counseling_zwei_06_14,Zwei and I have a debate about the definition of break time.
d_counseling_zwei_07_1,I always feel good whenever I return from the library.
d_counseling_zwei_07_2,"Do you enjoy going to the library, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_07_3,"Yeah, I like it."
d_counseling_zwei_07_4,"No, not really."
d_counseling_zwei_07_5,How about you come with me next time?
d_counseling_zwei_07_6,I'm curious about what kind of books you read.
d_counseling_zwei_07_7,I'm looking forward to it.
d_counseling_zwei_07_8,Oh... that's disappointing.
d_counseling_zwei_07_9,I thought we could go together.
d_counseling_zwei_07_10,Zwei and I have a conversation about libraries.
d_counseling_zwei_08_1,I think Miss Marciana is amazing.
d_counseling_zwei_08_2,"She's able to answer anything without a moment's hesitation, no matter what I ask her."
d_counseling_zwei_08_3,That's something to be expected from a teacher.
d_counseling_zwei_08_4,You could be capable of that as well with a bit of effort.
d_counseling_zwei_08_5,You think so?
d_counseling_zwei_08_6,Being a teacher is tougher than I thought.
d_counseling_zwei_08_7,Me?
d_counseling_zwei_08_8,Could I really do that if I try hard enough?
d_counseling_zwei_08_9,Of course.
d_counseling_zwei_08_10,I'm so honored that you think that!
d_counseling_zwei_08_11,I'll really put my nose to the grindstone.
d_counseling_zwei_08_12,I'll become just as amazing as Miss Marciana.
d_counseling_zwei_08_13,Zwei and I have a conversation about the teaching profession.
d_counseling_zwei_09_1,I finished most of my tasks today.
d_counseling_zwei_09_2,"Now all I've got to do is go back to the dorm and revise just a bit more, and it'll be perfect."
d_counseling_zwei_09_3,"You're so diligent, Zwei. You're amazing."
d_counseling_zwei_09_4,Isn't it hard living on such a rigid schedule every day?
d_counseling_zwei_09_5,I... er...
d_counseling_zwei_09_6,"N-no, no I'm not."
d_counseling_zwei_09_7,I'm just ordinary.
d_counseling_zwei_09_8,Still... it does feel good to hear you say that.
d_counseling_zwei_09_9,Not at all.
d_counseling_zwei_09_10,"If anything, it's more difficult whenever my plans go awry"
d_counseling_zwei_09_11,or when I can't maintain a regular schedule.
d_counseling_zwei_09_12,Zwei and I talk about her daily routine.
d_counseling_zwei_10_1,I ran into Biscuit and some puppies on the way here.
d_counseling_zwei_10_2,"They started rushing towards me,"
d_counseling_zwei_10_3,"and I didn't know what to do, so I just kinda froze."
d_counseling_zwei_10_4,... They were so cute.
d_counseling_zwei_10_5,If that happens again...
d_counseling_zwei_10_6,You should run towards them too.
d_counseling_zwei_10_7,"You should pet them, but slowly so as not to startle them."
d_counseling_zwei_10_8,What?
d_counseling_zwei_10_9,You mean I should rush towards them as well?
d_counseling_zwei_10_10,Is that even allowed?
d_counseling_zwei_10_11,"Oh,"
d_counseling_zwei_10_12,so that's what I should do?
d_counseling_zwei_10_13,"Okay, I'll remember that and try it next time."
d_counseling_zwei_10_14,"To be honest,"
d_counseling_zwei_10_15,I regret not taking the chance to pet them.
d_counseling_zwei_10_16,I teach Zwei how to properly handle puppies.
d_counseling_zwei_11_1,I recently visited a place called the Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_zwei_11_2,The maids asked me to chant a spell along with them.
d_counseling_zwei_11_3,"I didn't know what to do, so I wasn't able to fully participate."
d_counseling_zwei_11_4,"Do you happen to know how to do it, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_11_5,Give a demonstration.
d_counseling_zwei_11_6,Explain step by step.
d_counseling_zwei_11_7,This is how you do it.
d_counseling_zwei_11_8,"B-become tastier! Coochie woochie, boing!"
d_counseling_zwei_11_9,...
d_counseling_zwei_11_10,...
d_counseling_zwei_11_11,Was that the spell?
d_counseling_zwei_11_12,You just need to repeat what the maid asks you to say.
d_counseling_zwei_11_13,What was it again... Coochie woochie...
d_counseling_zwei_11_14,"... Argh, this is tough."
d_counseling_zwei_11_15,Maids are amazing.
d_counseling_zwei_11_16,I don't think I could do it. I'm too self-conscious.
d_counseling_zwei_11_17,Zwei and I practice chanting the spell.
d_counseling_zwei_12_1,Rei and Ein didn't pay any attention in class today.
d_counseling_zwei_12_2,How can I get them to focus during class?
d_counseling_zwei_12_3,How about making a game out of it?
d_counseling_zwei_12_4,It might be easier to just give up.
d_counseling_zwei_12_5,"Oooh,"
d_counseling_zwei_12_6,that seems like a good idea.
d_counseling_zwei_12_7,"Rei and Ein,"
d_counseling_zwei_12_8,they both take games quite seriously.
d_counseling_zwei_12_9,"Thank you for the advice, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_12_10,"You're right, it would be easier."
d_counseling_zwei_12_11,But I want them both to graduate.
d_counseling_zwei_12_12,"In order for that to happen, they're going to have to start paying more attention."
d_counseling_zwei_12_13,Zwei complains about her two classmates for a while.
d_counseling_zwei_13_1,Ein often goes to the karaoke bar.
d_counseling_zwei_13_2,It's amazing that she never gets tired of it.
d_counseling_zwei_13_3,I get so exhausted whenever I go there.
d_counseling_zwei_13_4,Maybe singing karaoke is to Ein what studying is for you.
d_counseling_zwei_13_5,The reason she can go as often as she does is because she enjoys it.
d_counseling_zwei_13_6,Just like I don't get tired whenever I'm studying.
d_counseling_zwei_13_7,It's the same for Ein when she goes to the karaoke bar.
d_counseling_zwei_13_8,That makes complete sense.
d_counseling_zwei_13_9,You have such a wonderful way of explaining things that they make perfect sense to me.
d_counseling_zwei_13_10,"No matter how fun it is, everyone has their limits."
d_counseling_zwei_13_11,Surely she must get tired of it at some point...
d_counseling_zwei_13_12,Hmm...
d_counseling_zwei_13_13,Zwei and I have a conversation about karaoke.
d_counseling_zwei_14_1,Don't you think Rei goes a bit overboard with the sweets?
d_counseling_zwei_14_2,I'm worried about her. She seems to have gotten worse lately.
d_counseling_zwei_14_3,What's the harm? Let her have sweets.
d_counseling_zwei_14_4,We should try to distract her with something healthier.
d_counseling_zwei_14_5,I'm really worried about her.
d_counseling_zwei_14_6,I can't just leave her alone.
d_counseling_zwei_14_7,Isn't there something that we can do?
d_counseling_zwei_14_8,Something healthier?
d_counseling_zwei_14_9,I think that's a great idea.
d_counseling_zwei_14_10,I should look for something else Rei might be interested in.
d_counseling_zwei_14_11,"Could you help me look, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_14_12,Zwei and I talk about how many snacks Rei eats per day.
d_counseling_zwei_15_1,"Rei said her head was hurting,"
d_counseling_zwei_15_2,"so I told her to go to the hospital,"
d_counseling_zwei_15_3,but then she got all mad and said I was being insensitive.
d_counseling_zwei_15_4,Did I do something wrong?
d_counseling_zwei_15_5,Maybe she only wanted some attention from you.
d_counseling_zwei_15_6,"If you're sick, you should go to the hospital. What's wrong with that?"
d_counseling_zwei_15_7,"Oh, you think?"
d_counseling_zwei_15_8,I never considered that.
d_counseling_zwei_15_9,"Oh my gosh, you're feeling sick? Are you okay? What can I do?"
d_counseling_zwei_15_10,Something like that?
d_counseling_zwei_15_11,Hmm... maybe I should try that out next time.
d_counseling_zwei_15_12,"I know, right?!"
d_counseling_zwei_15_13,I don't know that could be interpreted
d_counseling_zwei_15_14,as me being insensitive.
d_counseling_zwei_15_15,"Zwei leaves in a hurry, worried about Rei."
d_counseling_zwei_16_1,...
d_counseling_zwei_16_2,Zwei is asleep on the sofa.
d_counseling_zwei_16_3,Wake her up.
d_counseling_zwei_16_4,Don't wake her up.
d_counseling_zwei_16_5,H... uh?
d_counseling_zwei_16_6,I must have dozed off without realizing.
d_counseling_zwei_16_7,Thanks for waking me up.
d_counseling_zwei_16_8,Let's hurry and start our session.
d_counseling_zwei_16_9,Soon after.
d_counseling_zwei_16_10,...!
d_counseling_zwei_16_11,Wh-what time is it?!
d_counseling_zwei_16_12,I'm sorry for falling asleep!
d_counseling_zwei_16_13,I won't do it again!
d_counseling_zwei_16_14,"Once we've finished our session, Zwei returns to the dorm."
d_counseling_zwei_17_1,"I'm sorry for being late, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_17_2,I lost track of time while reading a book at the Library.
d_counseling_zwei_17_3,Sing a song as punishment.
d_counseling_zwei_17_4,"It's okay, it happens."
d_counseling_zwei_17_5,A-a song?!
d_counseling_zwei_17_6,...
d_counseling_zwei_17_7,... Uh...
d_counseling_zwei_17_8,Isn't there any way I could do another form of punishment?
d_counseling_zwei_17_9,... Oh.
d_counseling_zwei_17_10,"I knew you'd be forgiving, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_17_11,Thank you.
d_counseling_zwei_17_12,I'll make sure that it doesn't happen again.
d_counseling_zwei_17_13,Zwei is apologetic throughout the session.
d_counseling_zwei_18_1,"Are you afraid of Raptures, Teacher?"
d_counseling_zwei_18_2,"Yes, I am."
d_counseling_zwei_18_3,"No, I'm not."
d_counseling_zwei_18_4,... Wow.
d_counseling_zwei_18_5,I didn't expect you to say that.
d_counseling_zwei_18_6,"So you're afraid of Raptures, just like me?"
d_counseling_zwei_18_7,"Despite that,"
d_counseling_zwei_18_8,you always face them head-on without fear.
d_counseling_zwei_18_9,"You're amazing, Teacher."
d_counseling_zwei_18_10,I figured that's what you'd say.
d_counseling_zwei_18_11,I don't think I could ever be like that.
d_counseling_zwei_18_12,Zwei and I have a serious conversation about Raptures.
d_counseling_zwei_19_1,"Despite everything,"
d_counseling_zwei_19_2,I always enjoy the time I spend with Rei and Ein.
d_counseling_zwei_19_3,I'm surprised to hear you say that.
d_counseling_zwei_19_4,You have good friends.
d_counseling_zwei_19_5,You are?
d_counseling_zwei_19_6,"I know that I tend to complain about them a lot,"
d_counseling_zwei_19_7,"but when it's all said and done,"
d_counseling_zwei_19_8,I like those two.
d_counseling_zwei_19_9,"Haha,"
d_counseling_zwei_19_10,you're right.
d_counseling_zwei_19_11,They are good friends.
d_counseling_zwei_19_12,"They're extremely precious to me, and irreplaceable."
d_counseling_zwei_19_13,Zwei and I have a conversation about Rei and Ein.
d_counseling_zwei_20_1,Ein often gives me accessories and clothing items as a gift.
d_counseling_zwei_20_2,"The only thing is that I don't think any of them really suit me, so I've never tried any of them on."
d_counseling_zwei_20_3,I feel awkward getting dressed up and everything...
d_counseling_zwei_20_4,Why don't you think they'd suit you? I think you'd look cute in them.
d_counseling_zwei_20_5,Oh... Will Ein be hurt once she realizes that?
d_counseling_zwei_20_6,What?
d_counseling_zwei_20_7,Y-you do?
d_counseling_zwei_20_8,Well...
d_counseling_zwei_20_9,"If you think that,"
d_counseling_zwei_20_10,I suppose I can try dressing up next time...
d_counseling_zwei_20_11,Oh... do you think so?
d_counseling_zwei_20_12,I guess I should build up the courage and try them on next time.
d_counseling_zwei_20_13,Zwei and I have a conversation about what style of clothing suits her best.
d_counseling_rumani_01_1,"You've been slacking off with your workout, haven't you?"
d_counseling_rumani_01_2,How did you know?
d_counseling_rumani_01_3,N-no I haven't... I've been working out regularly.
d_counseling_rumani_01_4,I'll tell you how I know.
d_counseling_rumani_01_5,Your posture has really gotten poor.
d_counseling_rumani_01_6,"If you had been consistently working out, this wouldn't be happening."
d_counseling_rumani_01_7,"So, let's start hitting the gym together again."
d_counseling_rumani_01_8,Hmm... really?
d_counseling_rumani_01_9,How about we do a quick test then?
d_counseling_rumani_01_10,Let's start with 100 light squats.
d_counseling_rumani_01_11,Rumani gives me a simple fitness test.
d_counseling_rumani_02_1,Come over here for a second.
d_counseling_rumani_02_2,*Swoosh*
d_counseling_rumani_02_3,Rumani feels my arm.
d_counseling_rumani_02_4,Stay still.
d_counseling_rumani_02_5,Pull my arm away.
d_counseling_rumani_02_6,Just as I thought.
d_counseling_rumani_02_7,"Your body is naturally gifted,"
d_counseling_rumani_02_8,especially these forearm muscles of yours.
d_counseling_rumani_02_9,"Every time I see them, I'm amazed."
d_counseling_rumani_02_10,Huh?
d_counseling_rumani_02_11,Why are you pulling away all of a sudden?
d_counseling_rumani_02_12,Stay still for a moment.
d_counseling_rumani_02_13,Rumani admires my arm for what feels like a long time.
d_counseling_rumani_03_1,"When you're stressed or need a change of pace,"
d_counseling_rumani_03_2,exercising will perk you up in no time.
d_counseling_rumani_03_3,But it's so exhausting.
d_counseling_rumani_03_4,I'll try to do it more from now on.
d_counseling_rumani_03_5,"Of course, you might feel physically drained in the immediate moment,"
d_counseling_rumani_03_6,but there's so much more to it than that.
d_counseling_rumani_03_7,That's a fine idea.
d_counseling_rumani_03_8,"The longer you keep at it, the better it gets."
d_counseling_rumani_03_9,"When you exercise, endorphins are released, which reduces stress and increases happiness."
d_counseling_rumani_03_10,It's amazing how exercise can lift your mood!
d_counseling_rumani_03_11,"Personally, I find that a quick workout is all I need to switch up my mood."
d_counseling_rumani_04_1,"Also, my go-to motto is"
d_counseling_rumani_04_2,"""You can do it!"""
d_counseling_rumani_04_3,It's a bit bland.
d_counseling_rumani_04_4,Very cool.
d_counseling_rumani_04_5,You think so?
d_counseling_rumani_04_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_rumani_04_7,I thought it was unique.
d_counseling_rumani_04_8,"I know, right?"
d_counseling_rumani_04_9,"I believe that if you keep working hard, you can achieve anything."
d_counseling_rumani_04_10,"It's such a motivating phrase, isn't it?"
d_counseling_rumani_04_11,"Rumani and I shout ""You can do it!"" together."
d_counseling_rumani_05_1,"What's your favorite kind of weather, Gym Rat?"
d_counseling_rumani_05_2,I like sunny days.
d_counseling_rumani_05_3,I like rainy days.
d_counseling_rumani_05_4,We're on the same page.
d_counseling_rumani_05_5,I'm a big fan of sunny days as well.
d_counseling_rumani_05_6,Working up a sweat while running on a sunny day
d_counseling_rumani_05_7,is enough to make me positively ecstatic.
d_counseling_rumani_05_8,You like rainy days?
d_counseling_rumani_05_9,I'm afraid I can't say the same.
d_counseling_rumani_05_10,"When it rains outside, there's always at least one gym member who cancels or is a no show."
d_counseling_rumani_05_11,Rumani and I talk about the weather.
d_counseling_rumani_06_1,Which do you think is more important:
d_counseling_rumani_06_2,money or health?
d_counseling_rumani_06_3,Definitely money.
d_counseling_rumani_06_4,Definitely health.
d_counseling_rumani_06_5,Really?
d_counseling_rumani_06_6,"Of course, money is important,"
d_counseling_rumani_06_7,but I believe that health is paramount.
d_counseling_rumani_06_8,I knew you'd understand.
d_counseling_rumani_06_9,Health is the be-all and end-all!
d_counseling_rumani_06_10,No fortune in the world can buy good health.
d_counseling_rumani_06_11,Rumani and I talk about money and health.
d_counseling_rumani_07_1,Folkwang's sweat is truly remarkable.
d_counseling_rumani_07_2,"No matter what method you try, it just doesn't stop."
d_counseling_rumani_07_3,Would you like to be able to sweat like that?
d_counseling_rumani_07_4,"It's certainly intriguing, but it seems like it'd be uncomfortable."
d_counseling_rumani_07_5,Me?
d_counseling_rumani_07_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_rumani_07_7,"The more I think about it,"
d_counseling_rumani_07_8,the more I think it would be hard to handle.
d_counseling_rumani_07_9,You're right.
d_counseling_rumani_07_10,"Always on the hunt for the next AC unit,"
d_counseling_rumani_07_11,"finding the right supplements to take,"
d_counseling_rumani_07_12,and sweating without even exercising?
d_counseling_rumani_07_13,Sounds like it'd be terribly uncomfortable.
d_counseling_rumani_07_14,It's impressive that Folkwang manages as well as she does.
d_counseling_rumani_07_15,Rumani and I talk about Folkwang.
d_counseling_rumani_08_1,It seems Epinel has been substituting her meals
d_counseling_rumani_08_2,with chewing gum lately.
d_counseling_rumani_08_3,Is it as bad as I think it is?
d_counseling_rumani_08_4,It's quite serious. We need to do something.
d_counseling_rumani_08_5,"It's only one meal, so she should be fine, right?"
d_counseling_rumani_08_6,So you think it's a problem too?
d_counseling_rumani_08_7,"I hate to criticize her personal diet,"
d_counseling_rumani_08_8,but something needs to be done.
d_counseling_rumani_08_9,I'll have to make a proper diet plan with balanced nutrients for her.
d_counseling_rumani_08_10,What?
d_counseling_rumani_08_11,"Surely you don't skip meals like she does, right?"
d_counseling_rumani_08_12,You must have three square meals a day!
d_counseling_rumani_08_13,Rumani and I formulate a diet plan for Epinel together.
d_counseling_rumani_09_1,Do you realize how well-received you are?
d_counseling_rumani_09_2,What do you think is the secret to your popularity?
d_counseling_rumani_09_3,... My looks?
d_counseling_rumani_09_4,I'm actually not that popular...
d_counseling_rumani_09_5,Hmm...
d_counseling_rumani_09_6,I can't argue with that.
d_counseling_rumani_09_7,"You have such a handsome face,"
d_counseling_rumani_09_8,and a great physique too.
d_counseling_rumani_09_9,Huh?
d_counseling_rumani_09_10,Don't be silly.
d_counseling_rumani_09_11,"If you make a few calls and ask some of the Nikkes to hang out,"
d_counseling_rumani_09_12,an entire truckload of them will come rushing over.
d_counseling_rumani_09_13,Rumani and I talk about the reasons for my popularity.
d_counseling_rumani_10_1,*Huff*
d_counseling_rumani_10_2,*Huff...*
d_counseling_rumani_10_3,Rumani is doing squats.
d_counseling_rumani_10_4,Speak to her.
d_counseling_rumani_10_5,Wait for her to finish her workout.
d_counseling_rumani_10_6,Hold on a moment... *Huff*
d_counseling_rumani_10_7,Just 10 more... One last set... *Puff*
d_counseling_rumani_10_8,A moment later.
d_counseling_rumani_10_9,Whew. Done!
d_counseling_rumani_10_10,Thanks for waiting.
d_counseling_rumani_10_11,Finishing squats always feels so invigorating.
d_counseling_rumani_10_12,I have a meaningful conversation with Rumani.
d_counseling_rumani_11_1,Is there anyone you're fond of?
d_counseling_rumani_11_2,"You, Rumani."
d_counseling_rumani_11_3,Epinel.
d_counseling_rumani_11_4,!
d_counseling_rumani_11_5,You caught me off guard.
d_counseling_rumani_11_6,"I wasn't expecting such a direct answer,"
d_counseling_rumani_11_7,but I really appreciate that about you.
d_counseling_rumani_11_8,?
d_counseling_rumani_11_9,Epinel?
d_counseling_rumani_11_10,Hm...
d_counseling_rumani_11_11,"Oh, you must mean you like her as a little sister, right?"
d_counseling_rumani_11_12,I continue talking with Rumani about people we like.
d_counseling_rumani_12_1,"Epinel recommended that I try skateboarding, so I gave it a go."
d_counseling_rumani_12_2,"However, it turned out to be harder than I expected."
d_counseling_rumani_12_3,Same here. Want to practice together?
d_counseling_rumani_12_4,"If it's that hard, why don't you just give up?"
d_counseling_rumani_12_5,"Sure,"
d_counseling_rumani_12_6,that sounds great!
d_counseling_rumani_12_7,"I was planning on practicing alone, but practicing with you is much better!"
d_counseling_rumani_12_8,It's a good thing I brought my board with me.
d_counseling_rumani_12_9,Excuse me?
d_counseling_rumani_12_10,Giving up isn't in my vocabulary!
d_counseling_rumani_12_11,I'll practice as much as I have to!
d_counseling_rumani_12_12,I spend time practicing skateboarding with Rumani.
d_counseling_rumani_13_1,Hey... Gym Rat...
d_counseling_rumani_13_2,Rumani seems low on energy.
d_counseling_rumani_13_3,Hand her an energy bar.
d_counseling_rumani_13_4,Hand her a protein bar.
d_counseling_rumani_13_5,... What's this?
d_counseling_rumani_13_6,"Oh, thanks. That's thoughtful of you."
d_counseling_rumani_13_7,I'll have it later.
d_counseling_rumani_13_8,!
d_counseling_rumani_13_9,*Crunch crunch*
d_counseling_rumani_13_10,Whew... Thanks.
d_counseling_rumani_13_11,"I rushed over right after my workout,"
d_counseling_rumani_13_12,so my energy was running low.
d_counseling_rumani_13_13,"I usually bring snacks with me, but I ran out of those as well, haha."
d_counseling_rumani_13_14,Rumani tells me more about the snacks she typically brings with her.
d_counseling_rumani_14_1,"Whenever I run with Folkwang,"
d_counseling_rumani_14_2,I always lag behind.
d_counseling_rumani_14_3,Is there a good way I can keep up with her?
d_counseling_rumani_14_4,"Don't worry about her, and focus on setting your own pace."
d_counseling_rumani_14_5,Why don't you just talk to Folkwang?
d_counseling_rumani_14_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_rumani_14_7,You're right.
d_counseling_rumani_14_8,I don't need to strain myself just to keep up.
d_counseling_rumani_14_9,Thanks for the advice.
d_counseling_rumani_14_10,You don't think I've already done that?
d_counseling_rumani_14_11,"She says she'll keep the same pace with me,"
d_counseling_rumani_14_12,"but she always forgets, and I end up falling behind."
d_counseling_rumani_14_13,"After our session, I go for a run with Rumani."
d_counseling_rumani_15_1,All the gym members made it to class today!
d_counseling_rumani_15_2,It's days like this that really lift my spirits.
d_counseling_rumani_15_3,I hope it'll be the same tomorrow.
d_counseling_rumani_15_4,Maybe I'll skip tomorrow then?
d_counseling_rumani_15_5,I'll be there on time tomorrow.
d_counseling_rumani_15_6,... Gym Rat.
d_counseling_rumani_15_7,"You're joking, right?"
d_counseling_rumani_15_8,"Oh, yeah. Just kidding."
d_counseling_rumani_15_9,That's the spirit!
d_counseling_rumani_15_10,Let's aim for perfect attendance again!
d_counseling_rumani_15_11,We can do it!
d_counseling_rumani_15_12,I set an alarm to make sure not to be late for tomorrow's class.
d_counseling_rumani_16_1,I'm thinking of getting a new workout outfit.
d_counseling_rumani_16_2,What color do you think suits me best?
d_counseling_rumani_16_3,Something soothing and subdued.
d_counseling_rumani_16_4,Something vibrant and bold.
d_counseling_rumani_16_5,"Ah, I like that."
d_counseling_rumani_16_6,"There's a reason people often say ""less is more""."
d_counseling_rumani_16_7,I'll go with what you've chosen.
d_counseling_rumani_16_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_rumani_16_9,That might be a bit much.
d_counseling_rumani_16_10,It would hurt my eyes to look at it in the mirror.
d_counseling_rumani_16_11,Rumani and I talk more about her color preferences.
d_counseling_rumani_17_1,Some Nikkes look like they could really use a personal trainer.
d_counseling_rumani_17_2,For example...
d_counseling_rumani_17_3,Exia?
d_counseling_rumani_17_4,Centi?
d_counseling_rumani_17_5,Exactly!
d_counseling_rumani_17_6,"If you get a chance, I'd appreciate it if you could bring her here."
d_counseling_rumani_17_7,I get the sense that she requires close supervision.
d_counseling_rumani_17_8,Hmm?
d_counseling_rumani_17_9,Centi clearly takes excellent care of herself.
d_counseling_rumani_17_10,I often see her at the gym.
d_counseling_rumani_17_11,I discuss with Rumani the Nikkes that require fitness management.
d_counseling_rumani_18_1,Such nice weather today.
d_counseling_rumani_18_2,Do you want to work out together?
d_counseling_rumani_18_3,"Sure, let's go."
d_counseling_rumani_18_4,"No, I don't want to."
d_counseling_rumani_18_5,Great.
d_counseling_rumani_18_6,I knew you'd be up for it.
d_counseling_rumani_18_7,Let's go and get a good workout!
d_counseling_rumani_18_8,Oh... are you busy?
d_counseling_rumani_18_9,"If you're not, you should definitely join me."
d_counseling_rumani_18_10,It's good to move your body as often as you can.
d_counseling_rumani_18_11,"Come on, let's go."
d_counseling_rumani_18_12,I go out to work out with Rumani.
d_counseling_rumani_19_1,I've noticed many members coming in recently with an interest in dieting.
d_counseling_rumani_19_2,Have you ever gone on a diet?
d_counseling_rumani_19_3,Yes.
d_counseling_rumani_19_4,No.
d_counseling_rumani_19_5,Really?
d_counseling_rumani_19_6,"I thought your fantastic physique came to you effortlessly,"
d_counseling_rumani_19_7,but it turns out you've been on a diet before.
d_counseling_rumani_19_8,Give me all the details.
d_counseling_rumani_19_9,I'm curious!
d_counseling_rumani_19_10,I knew it!
d_counseling_rumani_19_11,Your physique is so remarkable
d_counseling_rumani_19_12,"that I knew it had to come to you naturally, not through diet."
d_counseling_rumani_19_13,Rumani and I talk more about dieting.
d_counseling_rumani_20_1,What do you think is important for staying fit?
d_counseling_rumani_20_2,Diet
d_counseling_rumani_20_3,or exercise?
d_counseling_rumani_20_4,Diet.
d_counseling_rumani_20_5,"Exercise, surely."
d_counseling_rumani_20_6,"Wow, I didn't expect you to get it right."
d_counseling_rumani_20_7,Most tend to think it's exercise.
d_counseling_rumani_20_8,You have an impressive understanding of the human body.
d_counseling_rumani_20_9,I'm impressed.
d_counseling_rumani_20_10,"Unfortunately, that's wrong."
d_counseling_rumani_20_11,"Exercise is important,"
d_counseling_rumani_20_12,but a proper diet is even more crucial.
d_counseling_rumani_20_13,Rumani and I talk about the importance of diet and exercise.
d_counseling_rouge_01_1,"A few days ago, I played a game with someone who was completely new to it,"
d_counseling_rouge_01_2,but I ended up losing.
d_counseling_rouge_01_3,I don't understand what the problem could have been.
d_counseling_rouge_01_4,I'm sure I made all the right decisions.
d_counseling_rouge_01_5,Maybe you were just unlucky.
d_counseling_rouge_01_6,Maybe your opponent had beginner's luck.
d_counseling_rouge_01_7,"Well, the coin did land heads side up that day."
d_counseling_rouge_01_8,So I don't think bad luck had anything to do with it.
d_counseling_rouge_01_9,"Ah, I've heard of that."
d_counseling_rouge_01_10,"Since they aren't familiar with the rules of the game, beginners are bolder and more unpredictable with their play style, which can actually allow them to defeat experienced players."
d_counseling_rouge_01_11,"I think I understand what happened now. Thank you, Highroller."
d_counseling_rouge_01_12,Rouge and I discuss the reasons behind her defeat.
d_counseling_rouge_02_1,"Are you superstitious, Highroller?"
d_counseling_rouge_02_2,"I am, but it's a secret."
d_counseling_rouge_02_3,Hm... Not really.
d_counseling_rouge_02_4,!!
d_counseling_rouge_02_5,Could you make an exception and share them with me?
d_counseling_rouge_02_6,"Whenever I oversleep, the lift would always stop on the top floor."
d_counseling_rouge_02_7,Is there more?
d_counseling_rouge_02_8,Rouge seems overjoyed at the prospect of finding someone she can discuss this topic with.
d_counseling_rouge_02_9,I'll try and think of some more.
d_counseling_rouge_02_10,...
d_counseling_rouge_02_11,You're quite lucky not to be superstitious.
d_counseling_rouge_02_12,I'm envious of you.
d_counseling_rouge_02_13,Rouge and I have a conversation about superstitions.
d_counseling_rouge_03_1,"Noir and Blanc are in the same squad as me,"
d_counseling_rouge_03_2,but I often find myself looking up to them.
d_counseling_rouge_03_3,They've always been so popular with people.
d_counseling_rouge_03_4,I wonder what's their secret?
d_counseling_rouge_03_5,Daily practice and effort?
d_counseling_rouge_03_6,Maybe it's their looks?
d_counseling_rouge_03_7,I think the same.
d_counseling_rouge_03_8,"I've never seen them slack off during practice,"
d_counseling_rouge_03_9,so their audience must pick up on that.
d_counseling_rouge_03_10,Hmm... I'm not sure about that.
d_counseling_rouge_03_11,"Everyone knows that they're beautiful, yes,"
d_counseling_rouge_03_12,but I think there's something that goes beyond their appearance.
d_counseling_rouge_03_13,Rouge and I talk about the potential reasons behind the popularity of the Bunny Girls.
d_counseling_rouge_04_1,Could we finish today's counseling early?
d_counseling_rouge_04_2,"There's an event going on at Coin Rush today, and my schedule got moved up a bit."
d_counseling_rouge_04_3,"Sure, we can wrap up early today."
d_counseling_rouge_04_4,"Sorry, but we really need to stick to our schedule."
d_counseling_rouge_04_5,"Perfect, thank you."
d_counseling_rouge_04_6,Can I come along?
d_counseling_rouge_04_7,Of course. We can go together once we're done.
d_counseling_rouge_04_8,Oh... okay.
d_counseling_rouge_04_9,Sorry to have asked. I realize this is part of your professional duties.
d_counseling_rouge_04_10,I should let Coin Rush know that I won't be coming in on time.
d_counseling_rouge_04_11,I'm kidding. We can finish early today.
d_counseling_rouge_04_12,Oh my gosh! Thank you!
d_counseling_rouge_04_13,"After our counseling session, Rouge hurries over to Coin Rush."
d_counseling_rouge_05_1,Whew...
d_counseling_rouge_05_2,"Coin Rush, back to the dorm. Coin Rush, back to the dorm."
d_counseling_rouge_05_3,"I really do love this job, but it gets exhausting sometimes."
d_counseling_rouge_05_4,"What do you do when you're feeling overwhelmed, Highroller?"
d_counseling_rouge_05_5,I take some time off and rest.
d_counseling_rouge_05_6,"When that happens, I just take on even more tasks."
d_counseling_rouge_05_7,Taking time for some R&R is also an integral part of one's professional life.
d_counseling_rouge_05_8,!!
d_counseling_rouge_05_9,I see.
d_counseling_rouge_05_10,I'll keep that in mind whenever I'm feeling tired in the future.
d_counseling_rouge_05_11,Are you sure that's a good idea?
d_counseling_rouge_05_12,I've heard that overworking yourself can also cause problems.
d_counseling_rouge_05_13,"It's called burnout, right?"
d_counseling_rouge_05_14,Rouge and I talk about what to do when the work we love becomes exhausting.
d_counseling_rouge_06_1,"Noir and Blanc are worlds apart in terms of appearance,"
d_counseling_rouge_06_2,"but if you observe them closely, you'll find they actually have something in common."
d_counseling_rouge_06_3,Do you know what that is?
d_counseling_rouge_06_4,The way their minds work.
d_counseling_rouge_06_5,That they follow me around?
d_counseling_rouge_06_6,Correct.
d_counseling_rouge_06_7,Their thoughts are always synching up
d_counseling_rouge_06_8,without them ever having said anything beforehand.
d_counseling_rouge_06_9,"As an observer, I often find it amazing."
d_counseling_rouge_06_10,...
d_counseling_rouge_06_11,"You're very confident,"
d_counseling_rouge_06_12,but don't you think that was a bit over the top?
d_counseling_rouge_06_13,"Sorry, I was only kidding."
d_counseling_rouge_06_14,Rouge and I talk about the similarities between Blanc and Noir.
d_counseling_rouge_07_1,"Highroller, would you like to play a simple game?"
d_counseling_rouge_07_2,*Swoosh*
d_counseling_rouge_07_3,Rouge takes out two cards from her pocket.
d_counseling_rouge_07_4,"If you select the Ace of Hearts, you win. If you select the Ace of Spades, I win."
d_counseling_rouge_07_5,Which one will you choose?
d_counseling_rouge_07_6,Left.
d_counseling_rouge_07_7,Right.
d_counseling_rouge_07_8,...
d_counseling_rouge_07_9,Ace of Hearts.
d_counseling_rouge_07_10,How did you know?
d_counseling_rouge_07_11,I just had a feeling.
d_counseling_rouge_07_12,Hehe.
d_counseling_rouge_07_13,Ace of Spades.
d_counseling_rouge_07_14,I win this time.
d_counseling_rouge_07_15,Would you like to play another game?
d_counseling_rouge_07_16,I spend some time playing a simple card game with Rouge.
d_counseling_rouge_08_1,I get to meet a wide variety of customers
d_counseling_rouge_08_2,"when I'm working at Coin Rush,"
d_counseling_rouge_08_3,and sometimes it's hard for me to control my emotions.
d_counseling_rouge_08_4,What do you think I should do?
d_counseling_rouge_08_5,"Don't hold back, and say something."
d_counseling_rouge_08_6,Try and hold it in to stay professional.
d_counseling_rouge_08_7,Is that right?
d_counseling_rouge_08_8,Somehow I think that would only
d_counseling_rouge_08_9,make the situation worse.
d_counseling_rouge_08_10,I was thinking the same.
d_counseling_rouge_08_11,"If we raise our voice in Coin Rush,"
d_counseling_rouge_08_12,"the customers would feel uneasy,"
d_counseling_rouge_08_13,especially if it was coming from the Game Master.
d_counseling_rouge_08_14,Rouge and I talk about how to deal with difficult customers.
d_counseling_rouge_09_1,"We want to prepare a unique prize for an upcoming event,"
d_counseling_rouge_09_2,but nothing is really coming to mind.
d_counseling_rouge_09_3,Do you have any good ideas?
d_counseling_rouge_09_4,A Mustang plushie.
d_counseling_rouge_09_5,Some rare jewels that won't break the bank.
d_counseling_rouge_09_6,...
d_counseling_rouge_09_7,"Boss is a well-known figure, sure,"
d_counseling_rouge_09_8,but surely we can come up with something more alluring than that?
d_counseling_rouge_09_9,"Mmm, eye-catching and opulent prices are sure to attract customers' attention."
d_counseling_rouge_09_10,Thank you. I think that's a great idea.
d_counseling_rouge_09_11,Rouge and I discuss the prizes for Coin Rush.
d_counseling_rouge_10_1,"Even though we're all part of the 777 Squad,"
d_counseling_rouge_10_2,we rarely run into each other when we're on the job.
d_counseling_rouge_10_3,I'm worried that we might lack the cohesion you'd find in other squads.
d_counseling_rouge_10_4,You all could meet up in the main hall.
d_counseling_rouge_10_5,Maybe the reason you all don't need to see each other often is because you trust each other.
d_counseling_rouge_10_6,That's not possible.
d_counseling_rouge_10_7,"If the Game Zone staff leave their posts too often,"
d_counseling_rouge_10_8,it would put a burden on the remaining staff members.
d_counseling_rouge_10_9,!!
d_counseling_rouge_10_10,I see.
d_counseling_rouge_10_11,"I trust them, and they trust me as well."
d_counseling_rouge_10_12,That's why we're all capable of doing our best in our respective positions without checking in on each other.
d_counseling_rouge_10_13,"Thanks for the encouragement, Highroller."
d_counseling_rouge_10_14,Rouge and I discuss the cohesion of her squad.
d_counseling_rouge_11_1,"Let's see if Lady Luck is on your side today, Highroller."
d_counseling_rouge_11_2,*Clink*
d_counseling_rouge_11_3,Rouge flips a coin and catches it.
d_counseling_rouge_11_4,"All right, take a guess:"
d_counseling_rouge_11_5,Heads or tails?
d_counseling_rouge_11_6,Heads.
d_counseling_rouge_11_7,Tails.
d_counseling_rouge_11_8,Rouge opens her hand.
d_counseling_rouge_11_9,It's heads.
d_counseling_rouge_11_10,Hehe.
d_counseling_rouge_11_11,Looks like you'll have good luck today.
d_counseling_rouge_11_12,Rouge opens her hand.
d_counseling_rouge_11_13,...!
d_counseling_rouge_11_14,It's tails.
d_counseling_rouge_11_15,You'd better be cautious today.
d_counseling_rouge_11_16,Rouge and I check on my luck for today.
d_counseling_rouge_12_1,"Coin Rush offers a wide variety of games and activities,"
d_counseling_rouge_12_2,so people come here for all sorts of reasons.
d_counseling_rouge_12_3,"What brings you to Coin Rush, Highroller?"
d_counseling_rouge_12_4,To play games.
d_counseling_rouge_12_5,To watch performances.
d_counseling_rouge_12_6,"Hehe, thank you."
d_counseling_rouge_12_7,"Since you frequently visit for the games,"
d_counseling_rouge_12_8,I'll do my utmost to ensure you receive top-notch service.
d_counseling_rouge_12_9,I see.
d_counseling_rouge_12_10,Watching performances is also a good choice.
d_counseling_rouge_12_11,"However, I do hope you'll visit the Game Zone after the performance."
d_counseling_rouge_12_12,Rouge and I discuss the reasons people visit Coin Rush.
d_counseling_rouge_13_1,Have you ever had those days where
d_counseling_rouge_13_2,"you're on top of everything,"
d_counseling_rouge_13_3,yet nothing seems to go your way?
d_counseling_rouge_13_4,What do you do on days like that?
d_counseling_rouge_13_5,I keep going until I win.
d_counseling_rouge_13_6,I stop and head home.
d_counseling_rouge_13_7,"Hehe, I'd like to praise your persistence,"
d_counseling_rouge_13_8,"but if you're too obsessed with winning,"
d_counseling_rouge_13_9,it could cloud your judgment.
d_counseling_rouge_13_10,That's a wise decision.
d_counseling_rouge_13_11,"Even though it may be just a game,"
d_counseling_rouge_13_12,a bad losing streak can take a real toll on the mind and body.
d_counseling_rouge_13_13,Rouge and I discuss what to do on days when you keep losing.
d_counseling_rouge_14_1,I had a really absurd dream yesterday.
d_counseling_rouge_14_2,"Blanc, Noir, and I had to swap jobs."
d_counseling_rouge_14_3,I think Bunny Rouge and pole dancing is a pretty good idea.
d_counseling_rouge_14_4,I think being a Game Master suits you better.
d_counseling_rouge_14_5,...
d_counseling_rouge_14_6,I don't think I have the talent for that.
d_counseling_rouge_14_7,I doubt I'd be able to hold out for long.
d_counseling_rouge_14_8,That's what I think too.
d_counseling_rouge_14_9,"I can't ever imagine myself doing a different job,"
d_counseling_rouge_14_10,especially one like Blanc and Noir's.
d_counseling_rouge_14_11,Rouge and I have a conversation about the dream she had last night.
d_counseling_rouge_15_1,"I work at Coin Rush every day,"
d_counseling_rouge_15_2,"so when a rare holiday comes around, I'm not sure how to relax."
d_counseling_rouge_15_3,"Honestly, I haven't had any memorable holidays so far."
d_counseling_rouge_15_4,How about going outside and getting some exercise?
d_counseling_rouge_15_5,Isn't doing nothing the best vacation of all?
d_counseling_rouge_15_6,"I'd like to make the most of my holiday, but..."
d_counseling_rouge_15_7,I'm not sure if that's the ideal choice.
d_counseling_rouge_15_8,Why not?
d_counseling_rouge_15_9,Exercising isn't exactly my thing.
d_counseling_rouge_15_10,Sorry? I'm not quite sure what you mean.
d_counseling_rouge_15_11,Not having any memorable holidays means you've done a good job at resting.
d_counseling_rouge_15_12,I suppose a holiday should be just that: a break from work.
d_counseling_rouge_15_13,"In other words, relaxing is the best way to spend a holiday."
d_counseling_rouge_15_14,Rouge and I talk about how to spend the holidays.
d_counseling_rouge_16_1,"Whenever I observe the customers,"
d_counseling_rouge_16_2,I notice that Coin Rush attracts people from all walks of life.
d_counseling_rouge_16_3,"If I weren't a Game Master,"
d_counseling_rouge_16_4,what career do you think I would have ended up in?
d_counseling_rouge_16_5,A member of the Maid Cafe?
d_counseling_rouge_16_6,A pro gamer.
d_counseling_rouge_16_7,"I am confident in my ability to entertain customers,"
d_counseling_rouge_16_8,but isn't there more to that job than that?
d_counseling_rouge_16_9,"Yeah, you'd have to spend a fair bit of time reciting spells to make food more delicious."
d_counseling_rouge_16_10,I'm not sure I'm built for that.
d_counseling_rouge_16_11,That's a job that requires quick judgment and a bit of luck.
d_counseling_rouge_16_12,It might be a good fit for me.
d_counseling_rouge_16_13,Rouge and I discuss which job might suit her.
d_counseling_rouge_17_1,Opinions differ on what plays a bigger role in winning.
d_counseling_rouge_17_2,"What do you think, Highroller?"
d_counseling_rouge_17_3,Skill is more important.
d_counseling_rouge_17_4,Luck is more important.
d_counseling_rouge_17_5,"Of course, skill is important,"
d_counseling_rouge_17_6,"but from my experience,"
d_counseling_rouge_17_7,even the most honed skills can be rendered useless by a stroke of good luck.
d_counseling_rouge_17_8,You and I think alike.
d_counseling_rouge_17_9,"No matter how polished your skills are,"
d_counseling_rouge_17_10,"if luck isn't on your side,"
d_counseling_rouge_17_11,you're bound to plunge into the depths of failure.
d_counseling_rouge_17_12,Rouge and I discuss what is most important for winning a game.
d_counseling_rouge_18_1,"We're conducting a survey at Coin Rush, so I have a question for you."
d_counseling_rouge_18_2,Are you satisfied with the service we provide?
d_counseling_rouge_18_3,Of course. It couldn't be better.
d_counseling_rouge_18_4,"Actually, there is something I'm not entirely happy with."
d_counseling_rouge_18_5,Thank you.
d_counseling_rouge_18_6,We'll continue to be attentive and
d_counseling_rouge_18_7,dedicated to maintaining the quality of our service.
d_counseling_rouge_18_8,...!
d_counseling_rouge_18_9,Which part do you think needs improvement?
d_counseling_rouge_18_10,"It's almost too perfect, which might actually be a flaw."
d_counseling_rouge_18_11,"... Highroller, this job is my livelihood, so I'd appreciate it if you refrained from joking."
d_counseling_rouge_18_12,Sorry.
d_counseling_rouge_18_13,Rouge and I have a conversation about the service at Coin Rush.
d_counseling_rouge_19_1,If Coin Rush offered a prize
d_counseling_rouge_19_2,"that could grant any wish of the winner,"
d_counseling_rouge_19_3,what would your wish be?
d_counseling_rouge_19_4,A supercar and an opulent mansion on Royal Road.
d_counseling_rouge_19_5,I'd wish for one of your wishes to be granted.
d_counseling_rouge_19_6,...
d_counseling_rouge_19_7,I didn't realize you were so...
d_counseling_rouge_19_8,materialistic.
d_counseling_rouge_19_9,I was just kidding.
d_counseling_rouge_19_10,My wish?
d_counseling_rouge_19_11,I didn't expect you to give that type of answer. I don't know what to say.
d_counseling_rouge_19_12,"I... I'm honored that you were thinking of me, Highroller."
d_counseling_rouge_19_13,Rouge and I talk about what wish we would make.
d_counseling_rouge_20_1,"Some people are such gaming fanatics, that they come to the Game Zone every day."
d_counseling_rouge_20_2,"While we appreciate that our customers enjoy our games,"
d_counseling_rouge_20_3,we do worry sometimes that they may be addicted.
d_counseling_rouge_20_4,What should I do in this situation?
d_counseling_rouge_20_5,Try offering different types of games every now and then.
d_counseling_rouge_20_6,Put a limit on how long they can play.
d_counseling_rouge_20_7,"For example, games that are more active and physical."
d_counseling_rouge_20_8,Hmm... That sounds like a good idea.
d_counseling_rouge_20_9,It might also be helpful to have them enjoy various cultural activities here.
d_counseling_rouge_20_10,"Thanks for the advice, Highroller."
d_counseling_rouge_20_11,Hmm... I'm not sure about that.
d_counseling_rouge_20_12,"Sure, they're less likely to become obsessed,"
d_counseling_rouge_20_13,but I think we'd end up getting complaints afterwards.
d_counseling_rouge_20_14,Rouge and I brainstorm on strategies for dealing with customers who are too absorbed in the games.
d_counseling_phantom_01_1,I've been working on my spelling lately.
d_counseling_phantom_01_2,"Being a librarian and all, it's something I ought to have down pat."
d_counseling_phantom_01_3,"On that note, I wanted to test you and see if you know whether this is spelled correctly or not."
d_counseling_phantom_01_4,Phantom shows me a piece of paper with 'haresmen' written on it.
d_counseling_phantom_01_5,Uh... what is this?
d_counseling_phantom_01_6,I can tell you confidently that it's spelled incorrectly.
d_counseling_phantom_01_7,I thought you'd have a good grasp of spelling.
d_counseling_phantom_01_8,I guess I was mistaken.
d_counseling_phantom_01_9,"This is the word ""harassment""."
d_counseling_phantom_01_10,"I've spent my entire life spelling it this way, only to discover it was wrong all along."
d_counseling_phantom_01_11,You'd do well to remember this spelling.
d_counseling_phantom_01_12,I knew you'd be good at this.
d_counseling_phantom_01_13,"I've spent my entire life spelling it this way, only to discover it was wrong all along."
d_counseling_phantom_01_14,"The correct spelling is apparently ""harassment""."
d_counseling_phantom_01_15,I've got to remember that well.
d_counseling_phantom_01_16,Phantom and I spend some time studying spelling.
d_counseling_phantom_02_1,What do you think is the most important trait for a thief to have?
d_counseling_phantom_02_2,N-not that I have any ulterior motives or anything!
d_counseling_phantom_02_3,"I just figured you were a fan of thieves, so I was curious to hear your thoughts."
d_counseling_phantom_02_4,A sense of justice.
d_counseling_phantom_02_5,A determination not to get caught.
d_counseling_phantom_02_6,I knew my instincts were right!
d_counseling_phantom_02_7,I'm so stoked that I finally have someone to talk to about what it means to be a thief.
d_counseling_phantom_02_8,I agree with you wholeheartedly.
d_counseling_phantom_02_9,"It's imperative to have an unwavering sense of justice, a desire to punish the wicked and support the righteous!"
d_counseling_phantom_02_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_phantom_02_11,"Of course, that's important too,"
d_counseling_phantom_02_12,"but if you only focused on that, you'd be little more than a petty thief."
d_counseling_phantom_02_13,I thought you understood the difference between a noble thief and a common criminal.
d_counseling_phantom_02_14,Could you maybe elaborate more on your thoughts?
d_counseling_phantom_02_15,Phantom and I have a passionate discussion about thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_03_1,I'm here.
d_counseling_phantom_03_2,What shall we talk about today?
d_counseling_phantom_03_3,... What's with the mask?
d_counseling_phantom_03_4,"Sorry, who are you?"
d_counseling_phantom_03_5,Mask...?
d_counseling_phantom_03_6,!!!
d_counseling_phantom_03_7,"Oh, um... this..."
d_counseling_phantom_03_8,*Ahem* I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.
d_counseling_phantom_03_9,Well... I'll be going now!
d_counseling_phantom_03_10,...!
d_counseling_phantom_03_11,"Oh dear, I must have taken a wrong turn."
d_counseling_phantom_03_12,"I'd kindly ask you to forget you saw me today, young man."
d_counseling_phantom_03_13,I'm sure we'll meet again some time.
d_counseling_phantom_03_14,Adios.
d_counseling_phantom_03_15,Phantom disappears without a trace.
d_counseling_phantom_04_1,I can't believe how many evil people there are in this world.
d_counseling_phantom_04_2,It pains me how much good people suffer.
d_counseling_phantom_04_3,How can we make the world a fairer place?
d_counseling_phantom_04_4,We just have to keep working at it.
d_counseling_phantom_04_5,"No matter how hard you try, making the world a fair place is still pretty tough."
d_counseling_phantom_04_6,You're right.
d_counseling_phantom_04_7,We must keep punishing the wicked and standing up for the righteous.
d_counseling_phantom_04_8,"If we do that, I believe the world will be a little better than it is now."
d_counseling_phantom_04_9,Your answer is a very practical one.
d_counseling_phantom_04_10,But even if that's true...
d_counseling_phantom_04_11,I want to keep trying.
d_counseling_phantom_04_12,I want to make the good people in the world just a little happier.
d_counseling_phantom_04_13,"So, will you join me in this effort?"
d_counseling_phantom_04_14,I have a serious talk with Phantom.
d_counseling_phantom_05_1,My squadmate Arcana gives me a Tarot reading every month.
d_counseling_phantom_05_2,"The cards say that living honestly and with integrity is the right path, but it's also bound to bring plenty of danger."
d_counseling_phantom_05_3,"You'll be out late at night more often, so you must be extra vigilant."
d_counseling_phantom_05_4,What do you think?
d_counseling_phantom_05_5,Doesn't sound like you at all.
d_counseling_phantom_05_6,It describes you to a T.
d_counseling_phantom_05_7,"Haha, I thought so too."
d_counseling_phantom_05_8,What danger could there possibly be for a mere librarian like me?
d_counseling_phantom_05_9,And why would I be out late at night so often?
d_counseling_phantom_05_10,"I know others have said her Tarot readings are eerily accurate, but I don't think that's the case for me."
d_counseling_phantom_05_11,I-is that so?
d_counseling_phantom_05_12,But what danger could there possibly be for a mere librarian like me?
d_counseling_phantom_05_13,And why would I be out late at night so often?
d_counseling_phantom_05_14,This is really hard to understand.
d_counseling_phantom_05_15,Does this mean I'll be working late and coming home in the evenings?
d_counseling_phantom_05_16,Phantom and I talk more about Tarot cards.
d_counseling_phantom_06_1,There haven't been too many new stories about thieves lately.
d_counseling_phantom_06_2,I wonder why that is?
d_counseling_phantom_06_3,Maybe there isn't enough interest from the public.
d_counseling_phantom_06_4,Maybe they're about to drop something amazing.
d_counseling_phantom_06_5,...!
d_counseling_phantom_06_6,How could you say that?!
d_counseling_phantom_06_7,"Sure, it's true that we don't have many people around us who are into thief novels,"
d_counseling_phantom_06_8,but surely there are countless fans out there!
d_counseling_phantom_06_9,There must be some grander reason behind the recent lack of new stories...
d_counseling_phantom_06_10,...!!
d_counseling_phantom_06_11,You make a good point.
d_counseling_phantom_06_12,"Lately, all the stories have been so fluffy."
d_counseling_phantom_06_13,This is the perfect time for a sensational masterpiece!
d_counseling_phantom_06_14,"Oh boy, this is great! I'm getting so excited now!"
d_counseling_phantom_06_15,I have a chat with Phantom while waiting for new stories about thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_07_1,I have a request for you.
d_counseling_phantom_07_2,"There is a place I must be tonight, and I need some time to prepare."
d_counseling_phantom_07_3,Could we end our session a bit early today?
d_counseling_phantom_07_4,Take me with you.
d_counseling_phantom_07_5,"Okay, I understand."
d_counseling_phantom_07_6,You want to come with me?
d_counseling_phantom_07_7,That... might be somewhat difficult.
d_counseling_phantom_07_8,It's dangerous... and it'll be quite late...
d_counseling_phantom_07_9,Er...
d_counseling_phantom_07_10,Are you really sure you want to come with me?
d_counseling_phantom_07_11,Thank you so much.
d_counseling_phantom_07_12,I appreciate you not asking any questions.
d_counseling_phantom_07_13,I hope that one day I'll be able to tell you everything.
d_counseling_phantom_07_14,I wrap up my session with Phantom earlier than originally scheduled.
d_counseling_phantom_08_1,Do you happen to know how to fold a paper airplane so that it flies far?
d_counseling_phantom_08_2,"I have been folding it as I learned from a video online,"
d_counseling_phantom_08_3,but I'm curious if there's a better method.
d_counseling_phantom_08_4,I know someone who's a pro at paper folding.
d_counseling_phantom_08_5,Want me to show you?
d_counseling_phantom_08_6,No way!
d_counseling_phantom_08_7,I had no idea such a thing existed.
d_counseling_phantom_08_8,Please introduce me to them the next time you get a chance!
d_counseling_phantom_08_9,"Oh, you're going to show me yourself?"
d_counseling_phantom_08_10,I really appreciate that.
d_counseling_phantom_08_11,*Swoosh* *Swoosh*
d_counseling_phantom_08_12,Hmm...
d_counseling_phantom_08_13,It looks more like a paper ball than a paper airplane...
d_counseling_phantom_08_14,I spend time making paper airplanes with Phantom.
d_counseling_phantom_09_1,Do you know?
d_counseling_phantom_09_2,"Even in libraries, there are shockingly nasty patrons."
d_counseling_phantom_09_3,"They will fold pages, scribble in books..."
d_counseling_phantom_09_4,But that's not even the worst thing.
d_counseling_phantom_09_5,People who give spoilers?
d_counseling_phantom_09_6,People who tear out the most exciting pages?
d_counseling_phantom_09_7,"No, that's not it."
d_counseling_phantom_09_8,"Of course, if someone were to reveal the culprit on the very first page of a whodunit,"
d_counseling_phantom_09_9,it would undoubtedly ruin the reading experience.
d_counseling_phantom_09_10,"Still, depending on the reader, this might be forgivable, so it's not the worst offense."
d_counseling_phantom_09_11,Yes! That's exactly it!
d_counseling_phantom_09_12,I'll be utterly engrossed in the story and fully caught up in excitement...
d_counseling_phantom_09_13,only to find that the entire climax has been torn out of the book!
d_counseling_phantom_09_14,"I'll be dying to know what happens next, but I'm unable to keep reading!"
d_counseling_phantom_09_15,"When all the excitement is shattered, and I'm left feeling empty,"
d_counseling_phantom_09_16,it's truly… a moment I never want to experience again.
d_counseling_phantom_09_17,Phantom and I discuss the horrible ways people behave in the library.
d_counseling_phantom_10_1,Sorry I'm late.
d_counseling_phantom_10_2,I went somewhere el...
d_counseling_phantom_10_3,?!
d_counseling_phantom_10_4,*Plop*
d_counseling_phantom_10_5,"Wh-where did those come from? I'm sorry, let me pick these up real quick."
d_counseling_phantom_10_6,Help Phantom pick up the calling cards.
d_counseling_phantom_10_7,Wait for Phantom to pick up all the calling cards.
d_counseling_phantom_10_8,"No, no!"
d_counseling_phantom_10_9,I-I'll get them. You stay right there.
d_counseling_phantom_10_10,"Don't move, don't even look! Just stay exactly where you are!"
d_counseling_phantom_10_11,...
d_counseling_phantom_10_12,...
d_counseling_phantom_10_13,Phew...
d_counseling_phantom_10_14,Thanks for waiting.
d_counseling_phantom_10_15,I have an enjoyable session with Phantom.
d_counseling_phantom_11_1,"In the books I've read, thieves use all sorts of things to outsmart their pursuers,"
d_counseling_phantom_11_2,"such as magic, gadgets, tricks of all kinds."
d_counseling_phantom_11_3,"I'd love to learn something like that... just as a hobby, of course."
d_counseling_phantom_11_4,Can you do anything like that?
d_counseling_phantom_11_5,Show Phantom a thumb-removing magic trick.
d_counseling_phantom_11_6,Show Phantom a simple mirror trick.
d_counseling_phantom_11_7,Whoa!
d_counseling_phantom_11_8,That's so creepy and cool!
d_counseling_phantom_11_9,However...
d_counseling_phantom_11_10,It's not really a trick a thief would use.
d_counseling_phantom_11_11,Whoa!
d_counseling_phantom_11_12,How did you do that?
d_counseling_phantom_11_13,I might be able to use that someday!
d_counseling_phantom_11_14,"... As a party trick, I mean."
d_counseling_phantom_11_15,I spend time showing Phantom some simple magic tricks.
d_counseling_phantom_12_1,"The police in the Ark seem to be quite competent,"
d_counseling_phantom_12_2,especially the A.C.P.U. squad. They're really impressive.
d_counseling_phantom_12_3,Who do you think is the most reliable member of the A.C.P.U.?
d_counseling_phantom_12_4,Poli.
d_counseling_phantom_12_5,"Miranda, maybe?"
d_counseling_phantom_12_6,You think so?
d_counseling_phantom_12_7,"Most people think that Poli is the most capable in the squad,"
d_counseling_phantom_12_8,but I think otherwise.
d_counseling_phantom_12_9,Miranda is more righteous and considerate of the citizens than anyone else I know.
d_counseling_phantom_12_10,"At heart, she's a true thie... Er, I mean, police officer."
d_counseling_phantom_12_11,!!!
d_counseling_phantom_12_12,Most people would choose Poli.
d_counseling_phantom_12_13,But looks like you think the same way I do.
d_counseling_phantom_12_14,Miranda is more righteous and considerate of the citizens than anyone else I know.
d_counseling_phantom_12_15,"At heart, she's a true thie... er, I mean, police officer. Hehe."
d_counseling_phantom_12_16,...
d_counseling_phantom_12_17,Phantom and I spend some time praising Miranda.
d_counseling_phantom_13_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_phantom_13_2,"This is just a hypothetical question,"
d_counseling_phantom_13_3,but what would you think about me becoming... a thief?
d_counseling_phantom_13_4,I think it would suit you really well.
d_counseling_phantom_13_5,I don't think it'd be much different from now.
d_counseling_phantom_13_6,R-really?!
d_counseling_phantom_13_7,Ahem!
d_counseling_phantom_13_8,"Thank you for the compliment. If I ever cosplay or something,"
d_counseling_phantom_13_9,perhaps I'll consider dressing up like a thief... hehe.
d_counseling_phantom_13_10,Really?
d_counseling_phantom_13_11,Um... is that supposed to be a compliment?
d_counseling_phantom_13_12,Does that mean I already seem like a thief?
d_counseling_phantom_13_13,Or is that a roundabout way of saying it wouldn't suit me?
d_counseling_phantom_13_14,I spend time talking with Phantom about thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_14_1,"The more I read these books about thieves,"
d_counseling_phantom_14_2,the more I think I can write one myself. So I gave it a try.
d_counseling_phantom_14_3,... Would you like to read it?
d_counseling_phantom_14_4,"Phantom hands me a stack of papers, the first of which is labeled ""The 102 Menings of Bing a Thiaf""."
d_counseling_phantom_14_5,"Uh... sure, I guess."
d_counseling_phantom_14_6,Could you possibly run a spell check on this first?
d_counseling_phantom_14_7,Thank you.
d_counseling_phantom_14_8,I'd love to hear your feedback when you're done with it.
d_counseling_phantom_14_9,It's a novel about the mindset and beliefs that I think a thief should have.
d_counseling_phantom_14_10,I hope you find it enjoyable.
d_counseling_phantom_14_11,So earnest is Phantom's expression that I couldn't bring myself to even mention the idea of asking for a spell check.
d_counseling_phantom_14_12,"Oh, sorry about that."
d_counseling_phantom_14_13,I always do the spell check at the very end.
d_counseling_phantom_14_14,"Once you've read it and given your feedback, I'll make the final revisions based on that"
d_counseling_phantom_14_15,and then run a spell check.
d_counseling_phantom_14_16,"Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read it."
d_counseling_phantom_14_17,...
d_counseling_phantom_14_18,"As I read through Phantom's writing, I feel my head start to spin."
d_counseling_phantom_15_1,I saw a news report stating the decline of people's reading habits.
d_counseling_phantom_15_2,Maybe that's why it's been so quiet at the library.
d_counseling_phantom_15_3,What can we do to encourage more people to read?
d_counseling_phantom_15_4,Increase the variety of books.
d_counseling_phantom_15_5,Promote the library by holding various events.
d_counseling_phantom_15_6,We already have plenty of books.
d_counseling_phantom_15_7,"We're the largest library in the entire Ark, with a wider variety of books than anywhere else."
d_counseling_phantom_15_8,I think what we really need to do is capture people's interest.
d_counseling_phantom_15_9,"For example, we could transform the library's interior with a thief-themed decor."
d_counseling_phantom_15_10,"Oh, that's a good idea."
d_counseling_phantom_15_11,Libraries often get a reputation for being quiet and stuffy.
d_counseling_phantom_15_12,"But if we promote and hold some events, we could pique others' interest and also lighten up our image!"
d_counseling_phantom_15_13,"A thief-themed event sounds fun, don't you think?"
d_counseling_phantom_15_14,I spend time with Phantom brainstorming how to increase people's reading.
d_counseling_phantom_16_1,"So, tell me,"
d_counseling_phantom_16_2,"if you were to become a thief, would you prefer a mask or a cape?"
d_counseling_phantom_16_3,Definitely a cape.
d_counseling_phantom_16_4,"A mask, no question."
d_counseling_phantom_16_5,!!
d_counseling_phantom_16_6,I feel the same way too.
d_counseling_phantom_16_7,"Of course, since a thief must conceal their identity, a mask is essential."
d_counseling_phantom_16_8,But the image of a cape fluttering in the wind... it's just too cool to resist!
d_counseling_phantom_16_9,"Hmm, is that so?"
d_counseling_phantom_16_10,"Of course, since a thief must conceal their identity, a mask is essential."
d_counseling_phantom_16_11,But I really do love the image of a cape fluttering in the wind.
d_counseling_phantom_16_12,I believe this is where the charm of a thief lies.
d_counseling_phantom_16_13,Phantom and I have a serious discussion about capes.
d_counseling_phantom_17_1,"I'm not saying that thieves are necessarily good people,"
d_counseling_phantom_17_2,but some people might see them as no different from common criminals.
d_counseling_phantom_17_3,"In order to change this perception, we need to raise more awareness about thieves."
d_counseling_phantom_17_4,Do you have any good ideas?
d_counseling_phantom_17_5,Let's give out thief novels for free.
d_counseling_phantom_17_6,Let's make a commercial about a thief's exploits.
d_counseling_phantom_17_7,"No, that won't work."
d_counseling_phantom_17_8,Giving out books to people who aren't interested in them
d_counseling_phantom_17_9,would be doing the authors of those novels a disservice.
d_counseling_phantom_17_10,There must be a better way.
d_counseling_phantom_17_11,Hmm... That seems like a good idea.
d_counseling_phantom_17_12,"Commercials are designed to promote, and even those who aren't initially interested might come across them by chance."
d_counseling_phantom_17_13,This could lead to a new realization for them.
d_counseling_phantom_17_14,That's a smart suggestion!
d_counseling_phantom_17_15,I spend time with Phantom thinking of ways to raise awareness about thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_18_1,People often think that reading a lot makes one seem intelligent.
d_counseling_phantom_18_2,"As a librarian who reads every day, when you look at me,"
d_counseling_phantom_18_3,what first comes to your mind?
d_counseling_phantom_18_4,Er... kn-knowledgeable?
d_counseling_phantom_18_5,A nerd obsessed with thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_18_6,"Haha, you're a terrible liar."
d_counseling_phantom_18_7,I know I'm not the most intellectual person out there.
d_counseling_phantom_18_8,"Next time, just be honest. It's a bit awkward watching you stumble over your words like that."
d_counseling_phantom_18_9,... But thanks for saying it anyway.
d_counseling_phantom_18_10,You're nothing if not brutally honest.
d_counseling_phantom_18_11,"Yes, I know that's what people think of me, and I personally like that."
d_counseling_phantom_18_12,"It's unique, and certainly more interesting than just being called smart."
d_counseling_phantom_18_13,"That's why I like the current version of myself more than the future me, when I'll just be considered knowledgeable."
d_counseling_phantom_18_14,Phantom and I talk about ourselves.
d_counseling_phantom_19_1,I recently started reading detective novels.
d_counseling_phantom_19_2,They certainly have some interesting plots.
d_counseling_phantom_19_3,Are you reading them to better understand the enemy?
d_counseling_phantom_19_4,Are you finally interested in something else other than thieves?
d_counseling_phantom_19_5,That's right.
d_counseling_phantom_19_6,Detectives are the sworn enemies of thieves.
d_counseling_phantom_19_7,"I started reading these books to get a better grasp of my foe, and they've been even more useful than I anticipated."
d_counseling_phantom_19_8,"I'll be stocking up on more detective books for now, so if you're interested, come by and read some."
d_counseling_phantom_19_9,!!!
d_counseling_phantom_19_10,What do you mean by that?
d_counseling_phantom_19_11,There's no way I would ever be interested in detectives.
d_counseling_phantom_19_12,They're the main foe of a thief.
d_counseling_phantom_19_13,I'm reading them to better understand my enemy.
d_counseling_phantom_19_14,"... Only in the capacity of an avid reader of thief novels, of course."
d_counseling_phantom_19_15,I spend time talking with Phantom about detective novels.
d_counseling_phantom_20_1,"Do you know countless movies, comics, and cartoons about thieves exist?"
d_counseling_phantom_20_2,It's not just books.
d_counseling_phantom_20_3,"Of course, I knew that."
d_counseling_phantom_20_4,"Wow, I had no idea."
d_counseling_phantom_20_5,R-really?
d_counseling_phantom_20_6,But why… why did you not tell me?
d_counseling_phantom_20_7,I… I only discovered this recently…
d_counseling_phantom_20_8,It feels as though my world… is crumbling around me…
d_counseling_phantom_20_9,Really?
d_counseling_phantom_20_10,"As expected, it's not easy to experience cultures outside of reading."
d_counseling_phantom_20_11,"So, why don't we explore them together, one by one?"
d_counseling_phantom_20_12,"How about starting with comics? They seem to be the most familiar, after all..."
d_counseling_phantom_20_13,I talk with Phantom about various forms of media related to thieves.

d_counseling_cinderella_01_1,"Take a look at me, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_01_2,"Tell me, what do you think of me today?"
d_counseling_cinderella_01_3,You're beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_01_4,You're very impressive.
d_counseling_cinderella_01_5,"An acceptable, but somewhat typical answer."
d_counseling_cinderella_01_6,I hope for a more delightful remark next time.
d_counseling_cinderella_01_7,"Anyone can give a perfunctory compliment such as that. It's beneath you, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_01_8,A perfect compliment!
d_counseling_cinderella_01_9,I thought the same thing whenever I looked in the mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_01_10,I often find myself admiring my own exquisiteness.
d_counseling_cinderella_01_11,Are you not curious about how ravishing I can become?
d_counseling_cinderella_01_12,Cinderella and I have a discussion about her beauty.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_title,Advising Cinderella: 02
d_counseling_cinderella_02_1,There's something I'd like to ask you.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_2,Do you think that there is such a thing as sublime beauty?
d_counseling_cinderella_02_3,Yes. You.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_4,"No, I don't think so."
d_counseling_cinderella_02_5,...
d_counseling_cinderella_02_6,I despise such soulless and hackneyed lines.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_7,They are far from beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_8,... Sorry.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_9,You're right.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_10,I knew you'd share my thoughts on the matter.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_11,There is no such thing as perfect beauty.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_12,That is precisely what makes it all the more resplendent.
d_counseling_cinderella_02_13,Cinderella and I have a discussion about beauty.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_title,Advising Cinderella: 03
d_counseling_cinderella_03_1,"There are many stories in this world,"
d_counseling_cinderella_03_2,and every story will have an ending.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_3,"What kind of ending do you prefer, Prince?"
d_counseling_cinderella_03_4,Happy endings.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_5,Tragic endings.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_6,As do I.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_7,A happy ending is the only way to properly bring a beautiful story to a conclusion.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_8,A tragic ending can never be considered beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_9,"No matter how enrapturing the story that unfolds before us,"
d_counseling_cinderella_03_10,only sorrow would remain for a tragic ending.
d_counseling_cinderella_03_11,Cinderella and I conclude the session by sharing stories about happy endings.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_title,Advising Cinderella: 04
d_counseling_cinderella_04_1,Hmm?
d_counseling_cinderella_04_2,There's a smudge on the mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_3,I'll replace it with a new one.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_4,I'll clean it so it looks brand new.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_5,"I appreciate the gesture, but I'll pass."
d_counseling_cinderella_04_6,"If I were to replace this mirror with another one simply because of a small smudge,"
d_counseling_cinderella_04_7,it would never have a chance to improve itself.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_8,I believe it's important to give things the opportunity to beautify themselves.
d_counseling_cinderella_04_9,"Thank you, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_04_10,"Thanks to you, this mirror has learned something today."
d_counseling_cinderella_04_11,"Although its pulchritude was besmirched due to this smudge,"
d_counseling_cinderella_04_12,"by wiping it away, it will shine even more beautifully than before."
d_counseling_cinderella_04_13,I spend time helping Cinderella clean the mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_title,Advising Cinderella: 05
d_counseling_cinderella_05_1,"Whenever I look in the mirror, I think about how truly beautiful I am."
d_counseling_cinderella_05_2,"And what about you, Prince?"
d_counseling_cinderella_05_3,How impressive my muscles are.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_4,How it gives me motivation to get through the day.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_5,"You don't seem used to receiving compliments from others about your appearance,"
d_counseling_cinderella_05_6,"but when you're alone, you sometimes get lost in your own comeliness."
d_counseling_cinderella_05_7,What a beautiful thought.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_8,A very positive and passionate statement.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_9,Does that mean you check the mirror only in the morning?
d_counseling_cinderella_05_10,Someone as handsome as you should check the mirror more often.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_11,Make it a habit to look in the mirror ten times an hour.
d_counseling_cinderella_05_12,I talk with Cinderella about the habit of looking at mirrors.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_title,Advising Cinderella: 06
d_counseling_cinderella_06_1,Grave is truly beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_2,I cannot understand why she insists that she's compromised.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_3,"What do you think of her, Prince?"
d_counseling_cinderella_06_4,"After all she's done to protect you, it's clear she has a wonderful heart."
d_counseling_cinderella_06_5,I can't really tell because of the helmet.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_6,You're right.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_7,Beauty doesn't just come from the outside.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_8,True beauty lies within.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_9,Helmet?
d_counseling_cinderella_06_10,"Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes, external beauty like mine may be more visually apparent,"
d_counseling_cinderella_06_11,but true beauty lies within.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_12,It is the same with me.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_13,That's why Grave is so magnificent.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_14,She is beautiful both inside and out.
d_counseling_cinderella_06_15,Cinderella and I talk about how beautiful Grave is.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_title,Advising Cinderella: 07
d_counseling_cinderella_07_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_cinderella_07_2,I feel like my appearance is somewhat lacking today.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_3,What do you think is the problem?
d_counseling_cinderella_07_4,You've become so beautiful that the mirror can no longer capture it.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_5,You seem as beautiful as ever to me.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_6,!!
d_counseling_cinderella_07_7,"Perhaps that could be it, yes."
d_counseling_cinderella_07_8,"The mirror's reflection is not as insightful as your eyes, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_07_9,"So, it turns out I am, in fact, more beautiful than ever."
d_counseling_cinderella_07_10,Thank you. I'll come to you whenever I feel I can't trust the mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_11,No.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_12,Consider how often I look into the mirror. I can notice the minutest changes.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_13,I'm telling you that I'm not as beautiful as I was yesterday.
d_counseling_cinderella_07_14,But why?
d_counseling_cinderella_07_15,I spend some time complimenting Cinderella and her beauty.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_title,Advising Cinderella: 08
d_counseling_cinderella_08_1,Who do you think is the fairest of them all?
d_counseling_cinderella_08_2,"Myself excluded, mind you."
d_counseling_cinderella_08_3,Then there's no one else to choose.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_4,There are too many to choose from.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_5,You're lying.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_6,...
d_counseling_cinderella_08_7,"Even so, it still feels rather lovely."
d_counseling_cinderella_08_8,"A lie perhaps, but a beautiful one."
d_counseling_cinderella_08_9,Truly.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_10,I appreciate your honesty.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_11,"Yet, there are moments when concealing the truth can be more beautiful."
d_counseling_cinderella_08_12,I have to go.
d_counseling_cinderella_08_13,Cinderella prematurely ends our counseling session.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_title,Advising Cinderella: 09
d_counseling_cinderella_09_1,People often say that one side of our face is more beautiful than the other.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_2,It's said that the more beautiful side is the one where your smile first graces your face.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_3,"So tell me, which side of my face is the more beautiful of the two?"
d_counseling_cinderella_09_4,Both sides are equally beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_5,The left side is more beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_6,...
d_counseling_cinderella_09_7,A person's face cannot be 100% symmetrical unless they're a mannequin.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_8,Prince.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_9,Have you really taken a good look at my features?
d_counseling_cinderella_09_10,That wasn't a very beautiful answer.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_11,Is that so?
d_counseling_cinderella_09_12,Hmm...
d_counseling_cinderella_09_13,"When I smile, it does seem to feel more natural on my left side."
d_counseling_cinderella_09_14,Perhaps that is the side that is a bit more alluring.
d_counseling_cinderella_09_15,"Thank you for your lovely answer, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_09_16,"For the rest of the session, I spend it observing Cinderella's countenance."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_title,Advising Cinderella: 10
d_counseling_cinderella_10_1,There simply aren't enough mirrors around here.
d_counseling_cinderella_10_2,How about bringing in 10 more?
d_counseling_cinderella_10_3,"Um... All right, I'll order them."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_4,I'll consider it. Give me some time...
d_counseling_cinderella_10_5,Hmm.
d_counseling_cinderella_10_6,"You say that, but you seem so displeased as if you're agreeing against your will."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_7,"If you don't really want to have more mirrors around, there's no point."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_8,All right.
d_counseling_cinderella_10_9,"Don't worry, I'm not forcing you."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_10,"It's just that I feel you don't admire your own beauty often enough, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_10_11,That's why I suggested you do it more often.
d_counseling_cinderella_10_12,Cinderella and I discuss how many mirrors should be placed in Reclamation Site 01.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_title,Advising Cinderella: 11
d_counseling_cinderella_11_1,"So much time has passed,"
d_counseling_cinderella_11_2,and yet they haven't given up.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_3,Are you talking about Grave?
d_counseling_cinderella_11_4,Are you talking about humanity?
d_counseling_cinderella_11_5,"Grave has indeed never given up on me,"
d_counseling_cinderella_11_6,but I'm not talking about her right now.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_7,"I was referring to all of humanity, and you especially."
d_counseling_cinderella_11_8,"Despite all that has happened, you have not given up."
d_counseling_cinderella_11_9,You're right.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_10,"This nightmarish war, which began before I was ever born,"
d_counseling_cinderella_11_11,could have been more than enough to lead humanity to despair and defeat.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_12,But neither you nor the rest of humanity has given up.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_13,That is truly a beautiful thing.
d_counseling_cinderella_11_14,Cinderella and I take a moment to admire our surroundings and get lost in thought.

d_counseling_cinderella_12_1,I want to change the interior of this place a bit.
d_counseling_cinderella_12_2,Do you have any good ideas?
d_counseling_cinderella_12_3,Marble floor.
d_counseling_cinderella_12_4,Glass sculptures.
d_counseling_cinderella_12_5,That's a fine idea.
d_counseling_cinderella_12_6,"As I walk, my face will reflect on the floor,"
d_counseling_cinderella_12_7,so I'll know how to hold my head to look even more beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_12_8,"If you take a perfectly fine piece of glass and turn it into mere trinkets, I won't be able to see my reflection in it."
d_counseling_cinderella_12_9,"It'll loses its purpose as a mirror, becoming just another ornament."
d_counseling_cinderella_12_10,"To me, such meaningless decor is far from beautiful."
d_counseling_cinderella_12_11,We finish our session by imagining potential interior designs for Reclamation Site 01.

d_counseling_cinderella_13_1,...
d_counseling_cinderella_13_2,You seem like you have something on your mind.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_3,I had a dream.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_4,A dream from long ago.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_5,Quietly wait for Cinderella to continue.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_6,Gingerly hand Cinderella a small mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_7,...
d_counseling_cinderella_13_8,It was quiet and lonely in the dream.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_9,"Even though I kept shouting, no one could hear me."
d_counseling_cinderella_13_10,...
d_counseling_cinderella_13_11,I'm glad.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_12,My reflection now is far more beautiful than the version of myself I saw in the dream.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_13,It's such a relief.
d_counseling_cinderella_13_14,I comfort Cinderella and conclude our session.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_title,Advising Cinderella: 14
d_counseling_cinderella_14_1,Wh-what is this?
d_counseling_cinderella_14_2,This mirror is so strange.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_3,Why does my head look so big?
d_counseling_cinderella_14_4,"Hehe, surprised? I just swapped it with a convex mirror."
d_counseling_cinderella_14_5,Maybe your head really has gotten bigger.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_6,I see.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_7,That's just perfect. I can see my face in greater detail now.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_8,I can examine each beautiful part more closely.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_9,"Thank you, Prince. It's such a special gift."
d_counseling_cinderella_14_10,...
d_counseling_cinderella_14_11,Prince.
d_counseling_cinderella_14_12,Are you serious?
d_counseling_cinderella_14_13,"No, I'm just kiddi..."
d_counseling_cinderella_14_14,Could my face really get so much bigger? All in a single day?
d_counseling_cinderella_14_15,This isn't beautiful... It must be a dream....
d_counseling_cinderella_14_16,I proceed to explain the convex mirror to Cinderella.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_title,Advising Cinderella: 15
d_counseling_cinderella_15_1,If...
d_counseling_cinderella_15_2,"If I had joined the Goddess Squad back then,"
d_counseling_cinderella_15_3,how do you think the world would have changed?
d_counseling_cinderella_15_4,Humanity would have been able to reclaim the surface much sooner.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_5,"Honestly, I don't know."
d_counseling_cinderella_15_6,I see.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_7,"If I had fought alongside those beautiful beings, we would have defeated the Queen with ease,"
d_counseling_cinderella_15_8,and gradually erased those hideous Raptures.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_9,Yes. You'd have no way of knowing
d_counseling_cinderella_15_10,just how beautiful I was when I was alongside the Goddesses.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_11,I'm sure things would have turned out differently.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_12,And then...
d_counseling_cinderella_15_13,our beautiful story would have come to an end.
d_counseling_cinderella_15_14,"After listening to Cinderella's story, I conclude our session."
d_counseling_cinderella_16_title,Advising Cinderella: 16
d_counseling_cinderella_16_1,"Can you help me comb my hair, Prince?"
d_counseling_cinderella_16_2,"My hair keeps getting tangled today, and it's really bothering me."
d_counseling_cinderella_16_3,Comb it gently from top to bottom in sections.
d_counseling_cinderella_16_4,Comb it from top to bottom all at once.
d_counseling_cinderella_16_5,*Swoosh* *Swoosh*
d_counseling_cinderella_16_6,"You're quite good at this, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_16_7,Have you had much experience combing long hair?
d_counseling_cinderella_16_8,You're able to untangle all the separate strands beautifully.
d_counseling_cinderella_16_9,"Thank you, that should do it."
d_counseling_cinderella_16_10,*Swoosh*
d_counseling_cinderella_16_11,...
d_counseling_cinderella_16_12,You did well... up to a certain point.
d_counseling_cinderella_16_13,It seems you're not very familiar with handling long hair.
d_counseling_cinderella_16_14,"If you comb it all at once, it'll only become more tangled and cause pain."
d_counseling_cinderella_16_15,I spend the rest of the session combing Cinderella's hair.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_title,Advising Cinderella: 17
d_counseling_cinderella_17_1,Prince.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_2,Do you not like me calling you that?
d_counseling_cinderella_17_3,Anis often regards it with a peculiar gaze.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_4,"No, it's fine."
d_counseling_cinderella_17_5,How would you feel if I called you Princess?
d_counseling_cinderella_17_6,I see.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_7,Then I'll continue to call you Prince.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_8,...
d_counseling_cinderella_17_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_cinderella_17_10,I prefer you simply call me by my name.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_11,It feels a bit… unusual to be called Princess.
d_counseling_cinderella_17_12,Hold on... is this how you've felt whenever I call you Prince?
d_counseling_cinderella_17_13,Perhaps I should change the way in which I address you then?
d_counseling_cinderella_17_14,Cinderella and I have a discussion about how we should address each other.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_title,Advising Cinderella: 18
d_counseling_cinderella_18_1,"Prince, what would you do"
d_counseling_cinderella_18_2,after we reclaim the surface?
d_counseling_cinderella_18_3,Find somewhere peaceful and rest.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_4,Throw an epic party.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_5,You and I feel the same in that regard.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_6,I want to bask in the newfound peace we've won
d_counseling_cinderella_18_7,at a place where the horizon meets the cloudless sky.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_8,"Of course, with mirrors, Grave, and you, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_18_9,That's a bit different from what I'd prefer.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_10,Loud celebrations aren't always beautiful.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_11,I want to bask in the newfound peace we've won
d_counseling_cinderella_18_12,at a place where the horizon meets the cloudless sky.
d_counseling_cinderella_18_13,I talk with Cinderella about the future.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_title,Advising Cinderella: 19
d_counseling_cinderella_19_1,"I have individuals I long to see,"
d_counseling_cinderella_19_2,though I'm uncertain of their whereabouts or whether I'll ever have the chance to meet them.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_3,"If you were in my place, would you go out and try to find them?"
d_counseling_cinderella_19_4,Of course. I'd go right away.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_5,I'd only set out looking for them once I was absolutely sure I'd be able to meet with them.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_6,I see.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_7,"You would venture out, even when there's uncertainty?"
d_counseling_cinderella_19_8,It is reckless and foolhardy.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_9,... But that is precisely
d_counseling_cinderella_19_10,"what makes you so beautiful, Prince."
d_counseling_cinderella_19_11,You're right. That would be the safer option.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_12,You wouldn't have to take unnecessary steps.
d_counseling_cinderella_19_13,But what if...
d_counseling_cinderella_19_14,something were to happen to them while I was trying to gather some proof?
d_counseling_cinderella_19_15,I wrap up the session with Cinderella.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_title,Advising Cinderella: 20
d_counseling_cinderella_20_1,...
d_counseling_cinderella_20_2,...
d_counseling_cinderella_20_3,Cinderella is staring blankly at the mirror.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_4,You're beautiful today as well.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_5,You're more beautiful than ever today.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_6,You're right.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_7,I am beautiful today.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_8,How is it that I can be so breathtaking day after day?
d_counseling_cinderella_20_9,I find this most satisfying.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_10,"In saying that,"
d_counseling_cinderella_20_11,you're implying that I wasn't as beautiful yesterday.
d_counseling_cinderella_20_12,"So tell me, what was it about me yesterday that was not beautiful?"
d_counseling_cinderella_20_13,"That way, I can ensure my beauty remains flawlessly consistent every single day."
d_counseling_cinderella_20_14,I end the session while admiring Cinderella's beauty.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 01
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_1,"Instructor, which do you prefer?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_2,"My new outfit,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_3,or my old one?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_4,The clothes you're wearing now suit you better.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_5,The old outfit suits you better.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_6,I knew you'd agree!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_7,I think these new clothes suit me much better.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_8,"It's like... they brighten my face, you know? Hehe."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_9,Really? I'm surprised to hear you say that.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_10,I think my current outfit is more flattering on me.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_11,Those old clothes were so dull. I didn't like them all that much.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_12,"Oh well, to each their own."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_01_13,Quency and I talk about outfits.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 02
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_1,"Instructor, I have a new dream."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_2,Guess what it is!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_3,Becoming my girlfriend?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_4,Becoming a phantom thief?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_5,"Ha, that's not a bad answer,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_6,but that's not it.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_7,Ding ding ding! Correct!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_9,"My dream is to become a phantom thief. After trying it a few times, it seems right up my alley."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_10,But it might change in a few days! Hehe.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_02_11,Quency and I talk more about our dreams and aspirations.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 03
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_1,"This outfit is a bit tight on me,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_2,so it's not the most comfortable thing to wear.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_3,"Putting it on is a bit of a hassle,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_4,but I really like it and want to wear it more often…
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_5,How about losing some weight?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_6,I'll help you put it on whenever you need.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_7,Instructor! Don't you know how rude it is to say things like that to a lady?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_8,"Besides, I'm already quite slim as is!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_9,"Hehe, so you'll lend me a helping hand?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_10,Really? Truly? All right then!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_11,I'll come and find you whenever I want to wear this.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_03_12,Quency and I talk about clothes.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 04
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_1,I'm thinking of creating a new route to the Commander's Room.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_2,Any ideas on where it should go?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_3,To the bed.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_4,To the shower.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_5,"Oooh, then I could watch you while you sleep!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_6,"That'd be awesome, hehe."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_7,I better get started straight away.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_8,The shower?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_9,Um...
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_10,But what if I enter at an... awkward time?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_11,"On second thought, I guess I wouldn't mind that... but would you be okay with it? Hehe..."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_04_12,Quency and I talk more about her new potential route.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 05
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_1,"Instructor, is there any chance we could wrap up our session early today?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_2,"I have somewhere I need to be, and it's rather urgent."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_3,"You're not up to any funny business, are you?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_4,You can go right now if you need to.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_5,Huh?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_6,Do I look like the kind of person who'd do something like that?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_7,"It saddens me that you see me that way, Instructor."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_8,Huh? You're letting me go without even asking why?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_9,"That's why I like you, Instructor!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_10,"We still have some time, so I'll stick around and chat a bit more!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_05_11,Quency and I have a pleasant counseling session together.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 06
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_1,"If I run into Guilty or Sin while I'm wearing this outfit,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_2,what should I tell them?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_3,I figured it'd be a good idea to think ahead.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_4,Just say you wanted a change of pace.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_5,Maybe it's better to be honest.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_6,Hmm. I don't think they'd believe me.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_7,"Besides, it could also lead to more misunderstandings."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_8,Is that so?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_9,... Maybe you're right.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_10,One lie usually leads to another.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_06_11,Quency and I talk about Guilty and Sin.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 07
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_1,"I've been pretty busy wandering around these past few nights, and I'm exhausted."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_2,These changes to my daily schedule really wear me out.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_3,Would you like to take a short nap?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_4,Would you like an energy drink?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_5,"I'm not sleepy, but fatigued."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_6,I think I'm just a bit tired. A little break should do the trick!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_7,When did you have time to prepare this?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_8,"Wow, I was really feeling worn out, so thanks a bunch!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_9,That really hit the spot. I'm feeling a lot less tired now!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_07_10,Quency and I talk about fatigue.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 08
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_1,You won't believe what happened today.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_2,"Phantom misspelled my name as ""Quincy""."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_3,"To be fair, that's an easy mistake to make."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_4,"You should write her name out as ""Phantim"" in return."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_5,"What? How could you possibly mix up ""Quency"" and ""Quincy""?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_6,They're totally different.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_7,Don't tell me you get them mixed up as well?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_8,"Hehe, that sounds fun!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_9,"Acting this way may be a bit childish,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_10,but I can't forgive her for getting my name wrong.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_08_11,Quency and I talk about names.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 09
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_1,"Whenever I'm with Miranda and Phantom,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_2,I lose track of time. Why is that?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_3,Maybe because they wear you down so much.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_4,Maybe it's because you're having so much fun.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_5,You think so?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_6,I do get distracted easily.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_7,It totally drains me at times...
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_8,"Wait! What am I saying? I have a blast whenever I'm around them, so much so that time always seems to fly by."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_9,"Just sitting back and watching them is the best form of entertainment, haha."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_10,It's definitely fun being around those two.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_11,It's like having front-row seats to a comedy show.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_12,"Hehe, just thinking about it makes me happy. I guess you're right, Instructor."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_09_13,Quency and I talk about Miranda and Phantom.

d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_4,A skintight dress.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_5,A casual pair of jeans.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_6,A dress? I've never worn one before!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_7,"It's a bit hard to imagine, but then again, I do like skirts!"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_8,"If that's what you want, I'll try it someday."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_9,Jeans?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_10,That doesn't seem like it'd be much different from what I'm wearing now.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_10_11,Is there anything else? I prefer skirts!

d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_7,"Ugh... I'm so ravenously hungry,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_8,I don't even think I have the strength to move.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_9,Don't you have anything to eat here?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_10,Really? That sounds awesome!

d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_12,It almost feels like we're newlyweds.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_11_13,"I cook a delicious meal for Quency, which we share in the Commander's Room."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 12
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_1,"Whenever I go out, people are always staring at me."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_2,Why do you think that is?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_3,Probably because they think you're pretty.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_4,Probably because of your outfit.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_5,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_6,I do feel like my looks have been on point lately.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_7,"It's nice that everyone recognizes how pretty I am. Jeez, that sounds awfully arrogant, doesn't it? Haha."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_8,Why? What's wrong with my outfit?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_12_9,"I don't think it's that. Maybe they're looking at me because they find me pretty, hehe."

d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_6,We really are in sync!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_7,It's no wonder you and I get along so well.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_8,Why aren't you saying anything?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_9,"You should shout, ""The Thieves of Justice!"""
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_10,"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_14_11,Quency and I talk about the Thieves of Justice.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 15
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_1,Instructor!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_2,"You saved all those bottle caps, didn't you?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_3,Sorry. I threw them out a few days ago.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_4,Here. These are all of Anis' soda bottles.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_5,What?! How could you?!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_6,"... Okay, fine. I guess it's understandable."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_7,I've been more focused on my thieving activities than those at the Rehabilitation Center.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_8,Don't these belong to Anis?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_9,Are you sure it's okay to give me all these?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_10,Just collect the bottle caps and give them to me whenever it's convenient. It's nothing that I need urgently.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_15_11,Quency and I have a pleasant counseling session.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 16
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_1,"Instructor, how do you relieve stress?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_2,"I don't know if it's because I've been running into some bad apples lately,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_3,but I feel like I'm under so much stress.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_4,I talk about it with my friends.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_5,I get some sleep.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_6,"Can I talk to you then, Instructor?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_7,I'm super stressed right now!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_8,"So, what happened was..."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_9,It's the stress that's keeping me up!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_10,I just can't stop tossing and turning.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_11,They don't say stress is the root of all evil for nothing.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_16_12,Quency and I talk about stress.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 17
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_1,Please let me be a righteous thief again today.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_2,Quency closes her eyes and prays earnestly.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_3,"All right, I'll allow it."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_4,That might be quite difficult.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_5,"Hehe, thanks for the permission."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_6,"Since I have your consent,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_7,I'll be even more diligent and teach all those bad guys out there a lesson.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_8,Huh? What makes you think that?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_9,Can't you just give me permission?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_10,Hold on... why are you the one getting to decide this anyway?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_17_11,Quency and I have a quirky counseling session.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 18
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_1,"You always look so handsome whenever I see you, Instructor."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_2,I almost want to steal your heart.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_3,"I am a thief after all, so maybe I should, hehe."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_4,"The thing is, you've already stolen it."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_5,You might have a hard time running off with it.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_6,Really? When did I do that?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_7,"You've stolen my heart too, Instructor."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_8,Does that mean we're both feeling the same feelings?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_9,Nothing is too hard for me.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_10,I'll show you how quickly I can steal your heart.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_11,I could do it in under an hour.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_18_12,Quency and I have a meaningful counseling session.

d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_1,"Instructor,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_2,are you busy today?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_3,"For you, Quency, I have all the time in the world."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_4,"Yeah, I'm a bit busy today."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_5,"Hehe, really?"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_6,Then let's go on a date.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_7,"On the way here, I passed by a place I would love to go to with you."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_8,Can't you spare just a few moments?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_9,There was this place I wanted to go to with you.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_10,"Okay, fine. I guess I'll go alone."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_19_11,Quency and I have a meaningful counseling session.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_title,Advising Quency: Escape Queen: 20
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_1,Hmph!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_2,Don't talk to me.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_3,Okay.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_4,Did I do something wrong?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_5,"I don't understand how you're so popular with women, Instructor."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_6,It's obvious that I look upset. Aren't you curious why?
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_7,"Hehe, no."
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_8,I just wanted to see how you'd react.
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_9,"And just as I thought,"
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_10,your reaction was adorable!
d_counseling_quency_escapequeen_20_11,Quency and I have a meaningful counseling session.
d_counseling_grave_01_title,Advising Grave: 01
d_counseling_grave_01_1,I have something I want to ask.
d_counseling_grave_01_2,What do you think when you see Cinderella?
d_counseling_grave_01_3,That she's beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_01_4,That she's a princess.
d_counseling_grave_01_5,That's right. She is beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_01_6,"Even after waking from sleep, her pulchritude remains undiminished."
d_counseling_grave_01_7,Isn't that simply amazing? I'm so happy for her.
d_counseling_grave_01_8,A princess?
d_counseling_grave_01_9,"I'm no sure what makes you say that,"
d_counseling_grave_01_10,"but I suppose Cinderella is as ravishing as a princess, yes."
d_counseling_grave_01_11,Grave and I have a conversation about Cinderella's beauty.
d_counseling_grave_02_title,Advising Grave: 02
d_counseling_grave_02_1,"Rapi, Neon, Anis..."
d_counseling_grave_02_2,"When I look at you all, memories of some individuals come to mind."
d_counseling_grave_02_3,"Their faces are blurry, but they were precious to me..."
d_counseling_grave_02_4,"Despite that, I can't even remember their name."
d_counseling_grave_02_5,... It makes me feel ashamed.
d_counseling_grave_02_6,"I know it's hard, but there's not much you can do."
d_counseling_grave_02_7,I'm sure you'll remember their names some day.
d_counseling_grave_02_8,... You're right. There's nothing I can do about it now.
d_counseling_grave_02_9,"So, until they and I are reunited and I get to hear their names once again,"
d_counseling_grave_02_10,I'll simply have to keep feeling bad about it.
d_counseling_grave_02_11,I will?
d_counseling_grave_02_12,... I certainly hope so.
d_counseling_grave_02_13,"If not, I'll just keep feeling sorry until I can see them again and hear their names."
d_counseling_grave_02_14,Grave and I contemplate ways to recall precious memories.
d_counseling_grave_03_title,Advising Grave: 03
d_counseling_grave_03_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_grave_03_2,Hmmmm...
d_counseling_grave_03_3,"Grave fiddles with her helmet, which covers only half of her face."
d_counseling_grave_03_4,Is the helmet uncomfortable?
d_counseling_grave_03_5,Does it feel awkward to only have half the helmet remaining?
d_counseling_grave_03_6,... No.
d_counseling_grave_03_7,"It feels strange to me, that's all."
d_counseling_grave_03_8,I think it will take some time to get used to.
d_counseling_grave_03_9,?!
d_counseling_grave_03_10,You're amazing!
d_counseling_grave_03_11,It's like you can read my mind!
d_counseling_grave_03_12,That's right. It feels a bit strange to have a helmet that only covers half my face.
d_counseling_grave_03_13,That's why I keep touching it.
d_counseling_grave_03_14,I adjust the helmet with Grave.
d_counseling_grave_04_title,Advising Grave: 04
d_counseling_grave_04_1,"Superhuman,"
d_counseling_grave_04_2,do you think that our fates are predetermined?
d_counseling_grave_04_3,I think so.
d_counseling_grave_04_4,I don't think so.
d_counseling_grave_04_5,"Even if that's the case,"
d_counseling_grave_04_6,I must try and rewrite our story anyhow.
d_counseling_grave_04_7,I refuse to let Cinderella's story end in tragedy.
d_counseling_grave_04_8,I must push forward
d_counseling_grave_04_9,and believe that our story is destined for a happy ending.
d_counseling_grave_04_10,I see. That's a relief.
d_counseling_grave_04_11,"If our fate is predetermined, I thought it might be difficult to rewrite our story."
d_counseling_grave_04_12,"If it's a path that hasn't been set in stone, then it's fine."
d_counseling_grave_04_13,We can rewrite it as much as we want.
d_counseling_grave_04_14,Grave and I have a conversation about our future plans.
d_counseling_grave_05_title,Advising Grave: 05
d_counseling_grave_05_1,"Sometimes, it doesn't feel real that Cinderella has opened her eyes."
d_counseling_grave_05_2,"It's as if everything up to now has been a dream,"
d_counseling_grave_05_3,"and when I wake up, I'll still be carrying her coffin while wandering around the Crystal Region."
d_counseling_grave_05_4,This is no dream. This is reality.
d_counseling_grave_05_5,This is a dream.
d_counseling_grave_05_6,"Yes, indeed... Hearing such words does give me reassurance."
d_counseling_grave_05_7,But I still have no small amount of anxiety.
d_counseling_grave_05_8,You are completely different from any other human I've known.
d_counseling_grave_05_9,"Perhaps that's why sometimes, I feel like you're from a dream."
d_counseling_grave_05_10,!!
d_counseling_grave_05_11,I... I see.
d_counseling_grave_05_12,It's as I feared.
d_counseling_grave_05_13,"Cinderella waking up, humans helping me... It's all a dream."
d_counseling_grave_05_14,Then how do I wake up...?
d_counseling_grave_05_15,Er... Sorry. I was only kidding.
d_counseling_grave_05_16,Is that... so?
d_counseling_grave_05_17,"If you don't believe me, go ahead and pinch yourself..."
d_counseling_grave_05_18,Like my cheek?
d_counseling_grave_05_19,*Pinch*
d_counseling_grave_05_20,Grave pinches her cheek hard.
d_counseling_grave_05_21,That hurts!
d_counseling_grave_05_22,It feels like I nearly pinched off a chunk of my cheek!
d_counseling_grave_05_23,"Ah, I see. The pain must mean that this is reality."
d_counseling_grave_05_24,I rub Grave's cheek.
d_counseling_grave_06_title,Advising Grave: 06
d_counseling_grave_06_1,"Superhuman,"
d_counseling_grave_06_2,why are you up on the surface?
d_counseling_grave_06_3,To create a happy ending with my comrades.
d_counseling_grave_06_4,I'm not so sure myself.
d_counseling_grave_06_5,!!
d_counseling_grave_06_6,So that is your dream as well?
d_counseling_grave_06_7,I believe you'll be able to achieve it.
d_counseling_grave_06_8,"You are no ordinary human, so it is possible."
d_counseling_grave_06_9,"If you cannot achieve it with your own strength, then I will help."
d_counseling_grave_06_10,"So, make sure to create a happy ending."
d_counseling_grave_06_11,You still don't have a goal?
d_counseling_grave_06_12,"In that case, you must decide now."
d_counseling_grave_06_13,"When putting your life on the line, your goal must be crystal clear."
d_counseling_grave_06_14,"Otherwise, you will be swept away by the vagaries of the world."
d_counseling_grave_06_15,I hope that doesn't happen to you.
d_counseling_grave_06_16,Grave and I have a conversation about reclaiming the surface.
d_counseling_grave_07_title,Advising Grave: 07
d_counseling_grave_07_1,"Whenever Cinderella says I'm beautiful,"
d_counseling_grave_07_2,I don't really know
d_counseling_grave_07_3,how to react.
d_counseling_grave_07_4,Tell her that she's even more beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_07_5,Just accept the compliment.
d_counseling_grave_07_6,!!
d_counseling_grave_07_7,"Yes, that's brilliant."
d_counseling_grave_07_8,"That way, I neither acknowledge that I'm beautiful nor deny what Cinderella is saying."
d_counseling_grave_07_9,You're really smart.
d_counseling_grave_07_10,I'll do exactly as you say. Thanks.
d_counseling_grave_07_11,What do you mean?
d_counseling_grave_07_12,"Beauty is something that applies to someone like Cinderella,"
d_counseling_grave_07_13,not for the likes of me.
d_counseling_grave_07_14,"I... am not beautiful, so I cannot say I am."
d_counseling_grave_07_15,Grave and I have a conversation about beauty.
d_counseling_grave_08_title,Advising Grave: 08
d_counseling_grave_08_1,I have a question.
d_counseling_grave_08_2,What do you think of Cinderella?
d_counseling_grave_08_3,She's a strong Nikke.
d_counseling_grave_08_4,She's a beautiful Nikke.
d_counseling_grave_08_5,Strong?
d_counseling_grave_08_6,Is that how you see Cinderella?
d_counseling_grave_08_7,"... I suppose that's also correct,"
d_counseling_grave_08_8,"but for me, rather than her strength,"
d_counseling_grave_08_9,her noble and beautiful inner self is what stands out most.
d_counseling_grave_08_10,Oh!
d_counseling_grave_08_11,I feel the same way!
d_counseling_grave_08_12,Cinderella is beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_08_13,"Yes, she possesses overwhelming strength, but it is her noble heart and sense of conviction"
d_counseling_grave_08_14,that is most beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_08_15,Grave and I have a conversation about Cinderella's beauty.
d_counseling_grave_09_title,Advising Grave: 09
d_counseling_grave_09_1,People say that the world has changed a lot since Cinderella was asleep.
d_counseling_grave_09_2,"I have no memories, so I cannot attest to whether that is true or not."
d_counseling_grave_09_3,Do you think the world has changed much?
d_counseling_grave_09_4,Just look at all the machines we have and you can see how much has changed.
d_counseling_grave_09_5,"Nah, not really."
d_counseling_grave_09_6,That's a good point.
d_counseling_grave_09_7,One glance at all the machines you've brought with you is enough to see how things have changed.
d_counseling_grave_09_8,"You're quite smart, Superhuman."
d_counseling_grave_09_9,So nothing has changed?
d_counseling_grave_09_10,But the machines you brought with you are different from before.
d_counseling_grave_09_11,Then it seems that the world is indeed changing.
d_counseling_grave_09_12,I want to look into these changes a bit more.
d_counseling_grave_09_13,"Then somehow, I feel like we can end this interminable war with the Raptures."
d_counseling_grave_09_14,Grave and I talk more about the world and how it's changed.
d_counseling_grave_10_title,Advising Grave: 10
d_counseling_grave_10_1,You said that you know our predecessors.
d_counseling_grave_10_2,I'm curious.
d_counseling_grave_10_3,How are they doing?
d_counseling_grave_10_4,They're still fighting for humanity.
d_counseling_grave_10_5,"One is a drunkard, another eats bugs, and the other is always obsessed with finding lewd stuff."
d_counseling_grave_10_6,... I see.
d_counseling_grave_10_7,"Even after all this time,"
d_counseling_grave_10_8,they're still continuing the fight.
d_counseling_grave_10_9,"They're living on, holding fast to their noble convictions."
d_counseling_grave_10_10,That's really beautiful.
d_counseling_grave_10_11,??
d_counseling_grave_10_12,Who are you talking about?
d_counseling_grave_10_13,I asked about my predecessors.
d_counseling_grave_10_14,The people you're talking about hardly sound like the stuff of legend.
d_counseling_grave_10_15,Legends don't live such slipshod lives.
d_counseling_grave_10_16,Grave tells me more about the Nikkes from her past.
d_counseling_grave_11_title,Advising Grave: 11
d_counseling_grave_11_1,I have a question.
d_counseling_grave_11_2,What's your favorite kind of weather?
d_counseling_grave_11_3,Sunny days.
d_counseling_grave_11_4,Rainy days.
d_counseling_grave_11_5,Me too!
d_counseling_grave_11_6,"Whenever it's not sunny, all sorts of unpredictable things could happen when I was carrying around the coffin."
d_counseling_grave_11_7,"And on cloudy days, you can hardly see the stars."
d_counseling_grave_11_8,That's not a problem when it's clear weather.
d_counseling_grave_11_9,You like rainy days?
d_counseling_grave_11_10,You have rather peculiar preferences.
d_counseling_grave_11_11,I hate it when it's not sunny out.
d_counseling_grave_11_12,"All sorts of unpredictable things can happen up on the surface, making it difficult to hide the coffin."
d_counseling_grave_11_13,"Also, you can't see any stars."
d_counseling_grave_11_14,So sunny days are what I enjoy the most.
d_counseling_grave_11_15,Grave and I pray for tomorrow's weather to be sunny.
d_counseling_grave_12_title,Advising Grave: 12
d_counseling_grave_12_1,"Superhuman,"
d_counseling_grave_12_2,what kind of place is the Ark in your eyes?
d_counseling_grave_12_3,It's not all it's cracked up to be.
d_counseling_grave_12_4,It's a perfectly ordinary place where humans live.
d_counseling_grave_12_5,... Is that so?
d_counseling_grave_12_6,The place I thought was paradise isn't paradise.
d_counseling_grave_12_7,... How sad.
d_counseling_grave_12_8,"Ordinary, you say?"
d_counseling_grave_12_9,So the humans residing there get to live ordinary lives?
d_counseling_grave_12_10,... That's a relief.
d_counseling_grave_12_11,Grave and I have a conversation about the Ark.
d_counseling_grave_13_title,Advising Grave: 13
d_counseling_grave_13_1,Grave is fixing the coffin that she always carries around.
d_counseling_grave_13_2,"Oh, hi. I'll be done with this in a moment."
d_counseling_grave_13_3,...
d_counseling_grave_13_4,What is it?
d_counseling_grave_13_5,Why are you staring at the coffin like that?
d_counseling_grave_13_6,I want to see what it's like to lay inside it.
d_counseling_grave_13_7,... It's nothing.
d_counseling_grave_13_8,You want to go into the coffin?
d_counseling_grave_13_9,You? Personally?
d_counseling_grave_13_10,It's okay if I can't...
d_counseling_grave_13_11,You look so disappointed.
d_counseling_grave_13_12,"I have no idea why you're so intent on lying inside there, but"
d_counseling_grave_13_13,"if you'd like to, go ahead."
d_counseling_grave_13_14,I appreciate you being so open with me.
d_counseling_grave_13_15,"If you want something, tell me."
d_counseling_grave_13_16,"I want to help you,"
d_counseling_grave_13_17,but I can't do that if you don't say anything.
d_counseling_grave_13_18,Then... can I go into the coffin?
d_counseling_grave_13_19,You want to lay inside the coffin?
d_counseling_grave_13_20,"... All right, go ahead."
d_counseling_grave_13_21,I head inside the coffin.
d_counseling_grave_13_22,It turns out to be much cozier than expected.
d_counseling_grave_14_title,Advising Grave: 14
d_counseling_grave_14_1,I feel like time has been passing by so quickly.
d_counseling_grave_14_2,So much has happened.
d_counseling_grave_14_3,I don't know if my head injury will worsen.
d_counseling_grave_14_4,There may come a day when I end up forgetting some things
d_counseling_grave_14_5,and the thought of that scares me.
d_counseling_grave_14_6,How about keeping a record of everything that's happened lately?
d_counseling_grave_14_7,Let's ask Cinderella to remember it all for you.
d_counseling_grave_14_8,A record?!
d_counseling_grave_14_9,That's a good idea.
d_counseling_grave_14_10,"If I have kept a record, even if I get hit on the head again or meet humans,"
d_counseling_grave_14_11,I'll still be able to recall the time I've spent here.
d_counseling_grave_14_12,Thank you for that suggestion. I should go talk with Cinderella.
d_counseling_grave_14_13,"No, asking Cinderella to remember everything all by herself"
d_counseling_grave_14_14,would be putting too much pressure on her.
d_counseling_grave_14_15,"Also, wouldn't it be sad if she was the only one who remembered everything?"
d_counseling_grave_14_16,I don't want to cause her that kind of pain.
d_counseling_grave_14_17,Grave and I have a conversation about the passage of time.
d_counseling_grave_15_title,Advising Grave: 15
d_counseling_grave_15_1,"Every time I see Neon, she badgers me about increasing my firepower."
d_counseling_grave_15_2,I keep telling her that firepower is not my forte.
d_counseling_grave_15_3,Just ignore her.
d_counseling_grave_15_4,"Just shout out ""Firepower!"" with her and she'll be satisfied."
d_counseling_grave_15_5,"That's what I've been doing,"
d_counseling_grave_15_6,but she keeps following and pestering me.
d_counseling_grave_15_7,So... I've no idea what else to do.
d_counseling_grave_15_8,Really?
d_counseling_grave_15_9,Is that all I need to do?
d_counseling_grave_15_10,"If that means she won't follow me around anymore,"
d_counseling_grave_15_11,I should try that immediately!
d_counseling_grave_15_12,Grave and I have a conversation about Neon's firepower.
d_counseling_grave_16_title,Advising Grave: 16
d_counseling_grave_16_1,I have a question.
d_counseling_grave_16_2,How exactly does one apologize?
d_counseling_grave_16_3,I don't know how to do it properly.
d_counseling_grave_16_4,You just need to do it with sincerity.
d_counseling_grave_16_5,Don't create situations where you need to apologize in the first place.
d_counseling_grave_16_6,So all you need to do
d_counseling_grave_16_7,is be sincere?
d_counseling_grave_16_8,I nod my head.
d_counseling_grave_16_9,I see. Okay.
d_counseling_grave_16_10,I'll do my best to be genuine
d_counseling_grave_16_11,when I apologize to Snow White for using her weapon first.
d_counseling_grave_16_12,I'm afraid that's not possible.
d_counseling_grave_16_13,I've already used Snow White's weapon.
d_counseling_grave_16_14,"What's done is done, and so I need to apologize to her somehow."
d_counseling_grave_16_15,Grave and I contemplate how she can apologize properly.

d_counseling_grave_17_1,These past few days have been rather strange.
d_counseling_grave_17_2,There are so many people bustling around.
d_counseling_grave_17_3,"My bad. It's quite noisy, isn't it?"
d_counseling_grave_17_4,Isn't it nice to be surrounded by good people?
d_counseling_grave_17_5,"Oh no,"
d_counseling_grave_17_6,I didn't mean it that way.
d_counseling_grave_17_7,They're all good people.
d_counseling_grave_17_8,I just meant that it felt strangely new in a good way.
d_counseling_grave_17_9,Indeed!
d_counseling_grave_17_10,It's a nice feeling.
d_counseling_grave_17_11,"I'm not used to being surrounded by so many people,"
d_counseling_grave_17_12,but it feels... good.
d_counseling_grave_17_13,I want to hold onto this feeling for a while longer.

d_counseling_grave_18_2,Grave is tinkering with a machine.
d_counseling_grave_18_3,Hmm...
d_counseling_grave_18_4,She seems very focused.
d_counseling_grave_18_5,Poke her cheek that isn't covered by the helmet.
d_counseling_grave_18_6,I'll wait until she finishes what she's doing.
d_counseling_grave_18_7,?!
d_counseling_grave_18_8,Wha... Did you just... poke my cheek?
d_counseling_grave_18_9,What am I supposed to take from that?
d_counseling_grave_18_10,Are you saying I shouldn't wear half a helmet?
d_counseling_grave_18_11,!!
d_counseling_grave_18_12,"Sorry, I didn't see you there."
d_counseling_grave_18_13,I was too focused on my work.
d_counseling_grave_18_14,Thanks for waiting.
d_counseling_grave_18_15,Grave and I talked about how to call her when she's focused on something.

d_counseling_grave_19_1,"Cinderella knows my past self,"
d_counseling_grave_19_2,but I don't.
d_counseling_grave_19_3,So I can't act like I used to be
d_counseling_grave_19_4,and I feel bad about that.
d_counseling_grave_19_5,Just be who you are right now.
d_counseling_grave_19_6,Your past memories will eventually return.
d_counseling_grave_19_7,Do you think so?
d_counseling_grave_19_8,But... will Cinderella be okay with how I am now?
d_counseling_grave_19_9,I'm certain she will.
d_counseling_grave_19_10,"All right... if you say it'll be fine, I'm sure it will be."
d_counseling_grave_19_11,...
d_counseling_grave_19_12,Thank you. I feel a little less guilty now.
d_counseling_grave_19_13,I don't think so.
d_counseling_grave_19_14,"If those memories could be so easily retrieved, they wouldn't have disappeared to begin with."
d_counseling_grave_19_15,"I've sustained traumatic brain injuries,"
d_counseling_grave_19_16,so I don't think those memories will return so easily.
d_counseling_grave_19_17,I advise Grave to have a heart-to-heart with Cinderella.
d_counseling_grave_20_title,Advising Grave: 20
d_counseling_grave_20_1,Cinderella asked if I had any thoughts of taking off the other half of my helmet.
d_counseling_grave_20_2,... Would you like me to take off the helmet as well?
d_counseling_grave_20_3,Only when you're ready.
d_counseling_grave_20_4,I would really like to see all of your face.
d_counseling_grave_20_5,!!
d_counseling_grave_20_6,When I'm ready...
d_counseling_grave_20_7,Thank you. I'm not comfortable with showing my scars just yet.
d_counseling_grave_20_8,So you feel the same way too.
d_counseling_grave_20_9,I... I'm sorry. I don't think I can just yet.
d_counseling_grave_20_10,"Cinderella keeps telling me that even with my scars, I'm still beautiful,"
d_counseling_grave_20_11,but I don't think so.
d_counseling_grave_20_12,How can a face as disfigured as mine be beautiful?
d_counseling_grave_20_13,"When I show myself to you all, I want to be beautiful,"
d_counseling_grave_20_14,so I don't think I can show you just yet.
d_counseling_grave_20_15,Grave and I have a heartfelt conversation.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_3,Do you by any chance enjoy those forbidden books
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_4,that Red Hood is always recommending?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_5,I read them whenever I'm eating.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_6,I'm not really interested in that kind of stuff.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_7,...?!
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_8,S-so you've been reading that... at every meal?!
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_9,"Er... Sorry to have bothered you, Commander."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_10,I-I'm going to go pray for a little bit...!
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_11,Oh... I figured that was the case.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_01_12,"Red Hood said that plenty of people read that kind of stuff, so I was curious."

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_3,"Now, even Red Hood..."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_4,...
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_5,I'm certain we can cure it.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_6,I'm certain we can beat this thing.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_7,Yes.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_8,"We will find a cure and heal everyone,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_9,including Red Hood and all the other sisters who are suffering.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_10,Yes... we will.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_02_11,"However, words alone won't suffice."

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_3,"Sometimes while I'm praying, these thoughts come into my mind and take away my focus."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_4,I'd take a break from working.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_5,I try and think about other things.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_6,"I see, that's a good idea."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_7,The fact that I'm getting distracted so easily might mean I need a break.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_8,"If I stop in the middle of a prayer, I have to start over from the beginning, but no matter."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_9,"More importantly, I should consider whether I am in the right state of mind to pray and take some time to compose myself."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_10,Hmm...
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_11,But won't that eventually lead to other distracting thoughts?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_12,"One thought leads to another, and before long, I won't be able to focus on my original prayers."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_03_13,Rapunzel leaves to clear her mind and pray.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_04_7,I prefer to remain in the background and watch over everyone.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_04_8,"Haha, I'm so glad to hear that!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_04_9,"I believe others feel the same way, but to me, each person is precious."

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_4,Certainly never a dull moment.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_5,It's definitely a bit chaotic.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_6,"Haha, indeed."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_7,"Quietude and solace are well and good,"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_8,but I believe I've adjusted to this more jocular atmosphere.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_9,I wouldn't necessarily say that.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_10,This atmosphere truly reflects the Goddess Squad's true nature.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_05_11,"If everyone were calm and silent, that'd feel awfully weird, don't you think?"

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_06_7,"Thank you for understanding, Commander."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_06_8,... It's just that I don't want our beloved sisters to leave this place feeling alone.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_06_9,"It is difficult, yes, but it is something I must do."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_06_10,I cannot allow myself to show such weakness.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_06_11,I'm sorry. Please give me a moment to gather myself.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_3,Red Hood has teased Snow White so much that she's locked herself in the workshop.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_4,She's been in there for a while. How do you think we can convince her to come out?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_5,Lure her out with some tasty food.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_6,"If you attract her attention somehow, she'll most likely come out on her own."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_7,"Oh, that's a good idea."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_8,"She should be getting hungry by now, and Snow White is a real food aficionado."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_9,I wonder what would be good to give her?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_10,Hmm... I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_11,"She's already feeling hurt, so I'd hate to be dishonest with her in any way."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_07_12,"Oh, it's almost mealtime. How about we attempt to lure her out with some tasty food?"

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_6,Sorry?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_7,"N-no, that's not what I meant."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_8,I was merely thinking how everyone must have an ideal final resting place.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_9,"As for me, I would prefer to be somewhere close to everyone."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_10,How unexpected!
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_11,I thought you might be weary of all this commotion and wish to be somewhere quieter.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_12,I think it would be nice to be close to everyone...
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_08_13,"That way, you wouldn't have a quiet or boring day, even in death."

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_12_6,"However, I believe it's her unwavering willpower that is the strongest of all."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_12_7,That is what allows her to unite us all as one.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_13_7,...
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_13_8,Very well.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_13_10,"Thank you, Commander."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_13_11,That doesn't mean I can simply wait around endlessly...
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_13_12,... But you do have a point. They almost certainly are working tirelessly.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_14_4,I just wish she would take better care of herself.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_14_5,I'm sure she has her reasons for acting this way.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_14_7,You're right.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_14_8,Perhaps someday she'll tell us

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_15_5,Can't you make up for it by praying more next time?

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_15_9,"Do you think that by doing this, I will be forgiven?"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_15_10,I'm worried that it would only lead to greater indolence.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_2,"Once this war ends, we will all go our separate ways."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_3,... Just thinking about that makes me sad.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_4,Won't we still get together from time to time?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_5,That kind of thing is inevitable with business relationships.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_6,Do you think so?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_7,I would love it if we could meet regularly.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_8,"All of us, just the way we are."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_9,Business relationships...?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_10,"You're not entirely wrong, but hearing that directly from you hurts a little."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_16_11,I thought we were a little closer than that.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_3,What do you think would make for more interesting attire?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_4,What Dorothy wears.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_5,What I wear.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_6,"Oh, that's true!"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_7,Red Hood always teases Dorothy for being so ladylike.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_8,"I've always thought Dorothy's clothing is gorgeous, but it seems that Red Hood finds them amusing."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_9,"I would like to try something similar if the opportunity arises, hehe."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_10,Clothes that you wear?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_11,But you wear a uniform. Isn't that fairly close to what I wear?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_17_12,I don't think that's terribly fun.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_3,"When I asked Red Hood, she said it was as if this veil of noise was smothering you."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_4,I can't possibly imagine.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_5,I bet you'd hear voices.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_6,Me neither.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_7,... I can hardly bear to imagine it.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_8,I think that's downplaying how traumatic it can be.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_9,It seems to me it's much more intense than that.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_10,"I may not have the right to say this, but I truly hope"
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_18_11,there is no pain or suffering.

d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_3,but there aren't any places like that around here.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_4,I thought you'd be used to this place by now.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_5,Isn't the act of praying more important than location?
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_6,"Of course, I've gotten used to it."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_7,"It's just that every time I pray, I can't help but wonder if this is the right place to do it."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_8,"It's almost instinctual for me, so I don't think I can change it easily."
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_9,...!
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_10,That's right.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_11,The location doesn't matter. What matters is that the prayer reaches where it's meant to go.
d_counseling_rapunzel_puregrace_19_12,Perhaps I've been living too strictly by the rules.

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_01_5,It's absolutely perfect. No customization needed.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_01_6,What?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_01_7,Only someone unfamiliar with the game would say something like that.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_01_8,"Just to be sure,"

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_02_4,Why do you want to do that?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_02_5,"Yeah, I used up all my mana while out hunting monsters."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_02_6,"If the players in the front had figured out their attack patterns earlier,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_02_7,maybe I would still have a bit of mana left.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_02_8,"Speaking of which, I've made up my mind."

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_03_4,Ice magic. It's so versatile!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_03_5,Explosive magic. It's so bombastic!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_03_6,You're right about that.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_03_7,"Explosive magic can only be used for destructive purposes,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_03_8,whereas ice magic is much more versatile.

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_5,"She thinks spells are a waste of time. Do you feel that way too, Commander?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_6,"Yes, they are. Enemies aren't going to stand around and wait for you to finish reciting a spell."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_7,I believe there's nothing more sacred than reciting a spell properly.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_8,But there's a certain romance to it!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_9,Isn't that reason enough to do it?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_10,"Besides,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_11,"this is a game, not real life."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_12,The enemies always wait around for me to finish my spells.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_13,I couldn't have said it better myself.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_14,It's about the romance and charm of it all.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_04_15,Who cares that reciting a spell adds to the casting time?

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_2,"Commander, what's your opinion on master sorcerers?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_3,They're quite impressive. Real trailblazers who tread the less-traveled path.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_4,You shouldn't waste your stats on something like that.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_5,Well said.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_6,"After all, there are no good or bad character classes. Each has their own merits."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_7,I'm glad I trained in various techniques in Iron Punch.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_05_8,...

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_5,"I'm pretty sure I've already asked this before, but is there any way I can get her to stop? I'm about to die of embarrassment."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_6,"We are destined to save the world, Ice Rose. Therefore, such a moniker is quite fitting for you."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_7,I'll try to suggest to Guillotine to use your regular name as much as possible.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_8,...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_9,Ugh.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_10,This really is the worst.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_06_11,"If you could, I'd really appreciate it."

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_3,"Do you think it's better I take it easy and start with a Rank 1 Adventurer Quest,"

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_6,Let's not waste our time and move on to the Master Rank Quest straight away.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_7,"Yes, let's do that."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_8,Leveling up your skills is all part of the adventure.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_9,"Haha, it's been a long time since it was just the two of us going into a dungeon."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_10,Don't worry. I won't be slacking off. I'll make sure our skills improve.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_11,"My my, you seem rather confident."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_12,Master Rank Quests usually involve defeating the toughest monster in the area.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_13,It'll be tough to clear with just the two of us.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_14,We can take Guillotine with us.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_15,Hmph.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_16,"FYI, we only have three lives."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_07_17,"If you end up spending all three, even if it's you, I'm gonna be upset."

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_08_6,"Um... I just realized I have something to do elsewhere, so..."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_08_7,Yes. There is.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_08_8,"I've been a tank my whole life. Now that I'm attempting to play as a damage dealer,"

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_5,"Supporters, of course."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_6,... So you're one of those types.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_7,Unable to dodge any of an enemy's attack patterns and blaming everything on the supporters.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_8,"Okay, fine. Let's go to the dungeon."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_9,I'll keep a close eye on the damage meter.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_10,"Surely, you'll be able to deal more damage than me, since I'm a supporter and all."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_11,Impressive!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_12,The only reason damage dealers can shine is thanks to the supporter taking care of everything in the background.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_13,Never forget that.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_09_14,A party only runs smoothly because of of a supporter.

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_5,Working as a team to achieve a goal is the true essence of any game.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_6,... You don't say.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_7,So the wolf's solitude is of their own choosing?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_8,I certainly hope that's the case.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_9,Precisely!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_10,Working towards a shared goal together
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_11,is what made me start gaming.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_10_12,But right now...

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_2,"When you go on raids, do you fully learn the strategy beforehand?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_3,Or do you just dive in and see how it goes?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_4,"I don't want anything to go wrong because of me, so I memorize my strategy back to front."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_5,"It can be fun figuring out all the enemies' little tricks, so I prefer diving in headfirst."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_6,That's where you and I differ.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_7,I believe strategy is something that has to develop naturally.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_8,You can't be afraid of failure while engaging in the process.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_12_9,"Yes, me too."

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_3,"First I've got Guillotine, who charges into battle before the mission briefing is even complete."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_4,Vesti just keeps smirking and spamming her explosive magic.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_5,"Then there's Volume, who doesn't focus on the battle at all and plays the electric guitar instead."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_6,Do you think I'll be able to run a raid as effectively as Exia does?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_7,Of course.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_8,This party was doomed from the start.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_9,I did learn a lot from Exia about communicating with other party members.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_10,I think I've got this.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_11,"If anyone gets out of line, challenge them to a one-on-one duel and put them in their place."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_12,That's the first lesson Exia taught me.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_13,Will you wait a moment?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_14,I've got to go make it clear to everyone about who exactly is in charge.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_15,Even you think we're doomed?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_13_16,"All right then, fine. You and I will defeat the final boss on our own."

d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_2,This place seems a lot like a typical video game village.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_3,"Elegg would love it if she were here, don't you think?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_4,"Absolutely. She would have been over the moon, installing BOOM left and right."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_5,Let's bring her with us next time.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_6,No doubt.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_7,"If it's ever possible,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_8,I'd love to come here with Elegg one day.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_9,"Yes, I hope the day will come"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_10,when we can scour dungeons and go on raids together.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_11,"Hehe, the only thing is that she'd be busy installing BOOM the entire time."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_12,...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_13,"Thanks for the reassurance, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_14_14,I pat Maiden on the back.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 15
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_2,This place seems a lot like a typical video game village.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_3,"Trony would love it if she were here, don't you think?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_4,"I don't know. I can see her clinging to your side, going on about how scary the monsters look."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_5,Let's bring her with us next time.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_6,You're right. That's probably how she would have behaved.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_7,"However, even if she'd have been scared, she'd still fight harder than anyone else."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_8,"If it's ever possible,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_9,I'd love to come here with Trony one day.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_10,"Yes, I hope that day will come."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_11,"I can teach her the basics, one at a time."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_12,"Hehe, I'm sure she'll be very thankful for that."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_13,...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_14,"Thanks for the reassurance, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_15_15,I pat Maiden on the back.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 16
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_2,"You saw that earlier, didn't you?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_3,Guillotine kept messing up when it came to the boss' attack patterns.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_4,"I've already explained it to her several times, but nothing's changed. What am I supposed to do?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_5,"There's an old saying that with enough patience, even murder can be avoided."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_6,She's new at this. It's not her fault.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_7,"Well, I've been more than patient enough. By that rationale, that means I can do whatever I want."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_8,Huh?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_9,I'm going to go talk to Guillotine for a moment.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_10,It's time to end this.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_11,*Sigh*... You're right.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_12,She's not the one at fault here.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_13,I should be patient and explain it to her again.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_16_14,I listen to Maiden's troubles.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 17
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_3,I've been thinking about Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_4,Why do you think it is that she's always so engrossed in her own fantasy world?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_5,Hard to say. Maybe it's a way for her to mask how lonely she feels?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_6,Haha! Ordinary people could never hope to comprehend the One-Winged Dark Lord!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_7,You might be onto something.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_8,If that's so...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_9,Guillotine isn't so different from me.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_10,...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_11,Fine! I don't particularly care that much about understanding it in the first place.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_17_12,Maiden and I have a conversation about Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 18
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_2,"Hypothetically speaking,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_3,"if I were to become an Irregular, would Guillotine have to put me down?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_4,She would have to uphold her duty as a member of Extrinsic.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_5,She would uphold her duty to you as a friend.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_6,Probably.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_7,"Members of Extrinsic must separate personal and professional matters,"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_8,and remain calm and collected while they fight for the Ark.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_9,"... I don't know why, but it makes me feel a bit sad."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_10,Do you think so?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_11,Would she still consider me a friend after I've been so distant to her?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_12,I'm not so sure.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_13,... Although I certainly hope so.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_18_14,Maiden and I have a serious conversation.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 19
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_2,"Commander, do you think I'll ever feel a sense of belonging?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_3,Of course. You have me.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_4,It's impossible to feel that way in a video game.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_5,!!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_6,And you also have Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_7,Guillotine?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_8,Do you think she feels that way about me?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_9,...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_10,"At any rate, I want to truly feel like I belong, so let's get hitched."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_11,That's right. I have guildmates who welcome me every time I log in.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_12,"Still, sometimes..."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_13,I find myself wishing to meet people who can embrace me for who I am.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_14,Uh...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_15,... Are there people like that out there?
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_16,*Glance* *Glance*
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_17,... You have me.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_18,"Have I ever told you, Commander?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_19,I love you.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_19_20,Maiden and I have a heart to heart.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_title,Advising Maiden: Ice Rose: 20
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_1,Maiden closes her eyes and recalls the past.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_2,"If Guillotine and I were to fight, who do you think would win?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_3,Of course Guillotine would win.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_4,Of course you would win.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_5,Pfff.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_6,"Me, lose to Guillotine?"
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_7,We'll see about that.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_8,"If there ever is a day when she and I come to blows, I will take her down if it's the last thing I do."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_9,Hehe...
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_10,Haha.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_11,Hahahaha!
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_12,"I knew I could count on you, Commander."
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_13,I should go brag about this to Guillotine.
d_counseling_maiden_icerose_20_14,Maiden and I talk about who would win in a fight.
d_counseling_flora_01_title,Advising Flora: 01
d_counseling_flora_01_1,This place where you are
d_counseling_flora_01_2,feels quite similar to my own garden.
d_counseling_flora_01_3,Because of the floral scent?
d_counseling_flora_01_4,Because of how comfortable it feels?
d_counseling_flora_01_5,"Floral scent, you say?"
d_counseling_flora_01_6,"Yes, you do have a most intoxicating fragrance,"
d_counseling_flora_01_7,but it's not quite as varied as my garden.
d_counseling_flora_01_8,"Haha, that's right."
d_counseling_flora_01_9,"I don't venture out of the garden very often,"
d_counseling_flora_01_10,so I tend to feel a bit ill at ease whenever I go out.
d_counseling_flora_01_11,"This place isn't like that at all, though."
d_counseling_flora_01_12,"It's quite nice, and I feel very comfortable."
d_counseling_flora_01_13,Flora and I have a casual chat.
d_counseling_flora_02_title,Advising Flora: 02
d_counseling_flora_02_1,You smell quite fragrant as well today.
d_counseling_flora_02_2,What do I smell like today?
d_counseling_flora_02_3,I'm wearing a new cologne. Do you like it?
d_counseling_flora_02_4,Like stock flowers.
d_counseling_flora_02_5,A rich and sweet fragrance.
d_counseling_flora_02_6,I wonder what scent you will carry next?
d_counseling_flora_02_7,"I'm always looking forward to the next time I can see you, Blossom."
d_counseling_flora_02_8,Oh.
d_counseling_flora_02_9,You're wearing cologne?
d_counseling_flora_02_10,That wasn't what I was referring to.
d_counseling_flora_02_11,It's your natural scent.
d_counseling_flora_02_12,Flora and I have a conversation about fragrance.
d_counseling_flora_03_title,Advising Flora: 03
d_counseling_flora_03_1,Blossom?
d_counseling_flora_03_2,You look exhausted.
d_counseling_flora_03_3,Shall we go to my garden for a while?
d_counseling_flora_03_4,It's okay. I'm only a little tired.
d_counseling_flora_03_5,Would that be okay?
d_counseling_flora_03_6,That's precisely why I'm offering for you to come.
d_counseling_flora_03_7,"Even if you're only a little tired, please come with me."
d_counseling_flora_03_8,Absolutely.
d_counseling_flora_03_9,Thank you for accepting even though you're tired.
d_counseling_flora_03_10,Why the garden though?
d_counseling_flora_03_11,Plants help reduce stress and soothe our tired minds.
d_counseling_flora_03_12,"Come with me for now, and experience it for yourself."
d_counseling_flora_03_13,You won't regret it.
d_counseling_flora_03_14,Flora and I head to the garden.
d_counseling_flora_04_title,Advising Flora: 04
d_counseling_flora_04_1,Blossom.
d_counseling_flora_04_2,What do you think is the most important thing required to make a flower bloom?
d_counseling_flora_04_3,"Quality nutrients, sunlight, and water."
d_counseling_flora_04_4,Connecting with it emotionally.
d_counseling_flora_04_5,Hm.
d_counseling_flora_04_6,"All those things you mentioned are indeed very important,"
d_counseling_flora_04_7,but there is something even more significant than that.
d_counseling_flora_04_8,"Haha, very good."
d_counseling_flora_04_9,You are quite a skilled gardener.
d_counseling_flora_04_10,The little ones in the garden are most delicate.
d_counseling_flora_04_11,"If you do not talk to them and build an emotional connection,"
d_counseling_flora_04_12,they might become despondent and refuse to bloom.
d_counseling_flora_04_13,Flora and I talk about what it takes to make a flower bloom.
d_counseling_flora_05_title,Advising Flora: 05
d_counseling_flora_05_1,Are you busy today?
d_counseling_flora_05_2,"Yes, I'm busy. Why?"
d_counseling_flora_05_3,"No, I'm free. Why?"
d_counseling_flora_05_4,I see...
d_counseling_flora_05_5,"If you're busy, then never mind."
d_counseling_flora_05_6,"Oh, that's a relief."
d_counseling_flora_05_7,"Hehe, the little ones will be happy."
d_counseling_flora_05_8,I was hoping you could stop by the garden.
d_counseling_flora_05_9,The little ones would love to see you.
d_counseling_flora_05_10,"Even if you can't make it today, your visiting the garden from time to time"
d_counseling_flora_05_11,would make both me and the little ones oh so pleased.
d_counseling_flora_05_12,"After our counseling session, I visit the garden."
d_counseling_flora_06_title,Advising Flora: 06
d_counseling_flora_06_1,What do you find most charming about flowers?
d_counseling_flora_06_2,Their freshness and effervescence.
d_counseling_flora_06_3,Their beauty and variety of colors.
d_counseling_flora_06_4,...!
d_counseling_flora_06_5,I'm surprised.
d_counseling_flora_06_6,I didn't know there would be someone else who felt the same as me.
d_counseling_flora_06_7,Most people are only drawn to flowers because of their appearance.
d_counseling_flora_06_8,"Haha, I feel like our minds really are in sync. This makes me so happy."
d_counseling_flora_06_9,That's true.
d_counseling_flora_06_10,Most people seem to feel that way.
d_counseling_flora_06_11,"I feel a little differently, however."
d_counseling_flora_06_12,Flora and I have a conversation about what makes flowers so charming.
d_counseling_flora_07_title,Advising Flora: 07
d_counseling_flora_07_1,Hmm♪
d_counseling_flora_07_2,Hmm hmm hmm♪
d_counseling_flora_07_3,Flora is humming.
d_counseling_flora_07_4,Talk to her.
d_counseling_flora_07_5,Watch her.
d_counseling_flora_07_6,Did something good happen?
d_counseling_flora_07_7,"Oh, hi, Blossom."
d_counseling_flora_07_8,"As a matter of fact, yes. A plant sprouted today."
d_counseling_flora_07_9,"It was a plant I don't have much information on, so I wasn't sure whether it would sprout or not."
d_counseling_flora_07_10,"Thankfully, it chose to reveal itself to the world, so I'm happy."
d_counseling_flora_07_11,Hmm hmm.... mmm?
d_counseling_flora_07_12,Blossom? How long have you been there?
d_counseling_flora_07_13,You startled me.
d_counseling_flora_07_14,"The next time you're here, you should let me know."
d_counseling_flora_07_15,Flora and I spend some leisurely hours together.
d_counseling_flora_08_title,Advising Flora: 08
d_counseling_flora_08_1,"Hello, Blossom."
d_counseling_flora_08_2,Hm?
d_counseling_flora_08_3,Is that a drink for me?
d_counseling_flora_08_4,That's right.
d_counseling_flora_08_5,Hand over some coffee to Flora.
d_counseling_flora_08_6,Hand over some water to Flora.
d_counseling_flora_08_7,"Oh, thank you."
d_counseling_flora_08_8,...
d_counseling_flora_08_9,"I'm sorry, I know you prepared this specially for me,"
d_counseling_flora_08_10,but could you perhaps swap it for water instead?
d_counseling_flora_08_11,"Oh, thank you."
d_counseling_flora_08_12,*Gulp*
d_counseling_flora_08_13,"Hehe, maybe it's because you prepared it specially for me,"
d_counseling_flora_08_14,but this water tastes particularly nice.
d_counseling_flora_08_15,So refreshing.
d_counseling_flora_08_16,Flora and I have an amiable session.
d_counseling_flora_09_title,Advising Flora: 09
d_counseling_flora_09_1,Flowers and butterflies each find great value in the other.
d_counseling_flora_09_2,They're practically inseparable.
d_counseling_flora_09_3,Like you and me?
d_counseling_flora_09_4,Like you and your garden?
d_counseling_flora_09_5,Hm?
d_counseling_flora_09_6,"Of course I find great value in you, Blossom,"
d_counseling_flora_09_7,but would you say that we're inseparable?
d_counseling_flora_09_8,That's a wonderful example!
d_counseling_flora_09_9,This garden and I are indeed inseparable.
d_counseling_flora_09_10,"We share an immeasurably deep connection, one which is very precious."
d_counseling_flora_09_11,That's why I continue to nurture it with as much love and care as I possibly can.
d_counseling_flora_09_12,Flora and I have a conversation about what we hold dear to us.
d_counseling_flora_10_title,Advising Flora: 10
d_counseling_flora_10_1,"I'm sorry to ask this, Blossom, but"
d_counseling_flora_10_2,is there any chance we could end today's session early?
d_counseling_flora_10_3,"Sure, no problem."
d_counseling_flora_10_4,"Sorry, but I'd rather not."
d_counseling_flora_10_5,"I know you're incredibly busy, and yet you still made time for me."
d_counseling_flora_10_6,Thank you for agreeing so readily.
d_counseling_flora_10_7,You're a truly kind person.
d_counseling_flora_10_8,... I figured that would be the case.
d_counseling_flora_10_9,"You're incredibly busy, and yet you still made time for me."
d_counseling_flora_10_10,I'm sorry for asking.
d_counseling_flora_10_11,Is there something wrong?
d_counseling_flora_10_12,One of the little ones has begun to wilt.
d_counseling_flora_10_13,"It's got me worried sick, so much so that I don't think I'll be able to focus during our session."
d_counseling_flora_10_14,I plan to go back immediately after we're done here.
d_counseling_flora_10_15,Flora leaves quickly as soon as our counseling session is over.
d_counseling_flora_11_title,Advising Flora: 11
d_counseling_flora_11_1,"Trina, one of my squadmates, is such a kind and friendly person."
d_counseling_flora_11_2,"The only thing is... she's fond of taking her clothes off, and I don't know how to stop her."
d_counseling_flora_11_3,Do you have any suggestions?
d_counseling_flora_11_4,Why not just let her do her thing?
d_counseling_flora_11_5,"When she disrobes, throw some new clothes on her straight away."
d_counseling_flora_11_6,"If I leave her to her own devices,"
d_counseling_flora_11_7,she'd walk around stark naked all the time.
d_counseling_flora_11_8,That would be... problematic.
d_counseling_flora_11_9,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_flora_11_10,I had the wrong approach from the get-go.
d_counseling_flora_11_11,"I shouldn't stop her, but let her go ahead and then help her put her clothes right back on."
d_counseling_flora_11_12,"That seems like a good idea, Blossom. Thank you."
d_counseling_flora_11_13,Flora and I continue to discuss Trina.
d_counseling_flora_12_title,Advising Flora: 12
d_counseling_flora_12_1,Hmm?
d_counseling_flora_12_2,"This is an artificial flower,"
d_counseling_flora_12_3,but it's crafted most skillfully.
d_counseling_flora_12_4,I prefer real flowers.
d_counseling_flora_12_5,It's almost the same as a real flower.
d_counseling_flora_12_6,"Mmm, yes."
d_counseling_flora_12_7,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_flora_12_8,Except... It's hard to come across real flowers in the Ark.
d_counseling_flora_12_9,It's rather unfortunate.
d_counseling_flora_12_10,What?
d_counseling_flora_12_11,...
d_counseling_flora_12_12,"You're not being serious, are you?"
d_counseling_flora_12_13,Flora and I talk about the differences between artificial and real flowers.
d_counseling_flora_13_title,Advising Flora: 13
d_counseling_flora_13_1,"Hello, Blossom."
d_counseling_flora_13_2,There is dirt on Flora's skirt.
d_counseling_flora_13_3,Mention it to her.
d_counseling_flora_13_4,Brush it off for her.
d_counseling_flora_13_5,"Oh, you're right."
d_counseling_flora_13_6,"I thought I had brushed it all off, but I must have missed this part."
d_counseling_flora_13_7,"I don't want to dirty up your room, so I'll get rid of it later when I'm outside."
d_counseling_flora_13_8,*Swoosh swoosh*
d_counseling_flora_13_9,Hmm?
d_counseling_flora_13_10,"Oh, darn it."
d_counseling_flora_13_11,I must have missed that patch of dirt earlier.
d_counseling_flora_13_12,"Haha, thank you."
d_counseling_flora_13_13,Flora and I have a pleasant counseling session.

d_counseling_flora_14_2,*Gasp*... *Gasp*...
d_counseling_flora_14_3,Sor... sorry for being late!
d_counseling_flora_14_4,It's okay. Catch your breath first.
d_counseling_flora_14_5,What took you so long?
d_counseling_flora_14_6,Th-thank you...
d_counseling_flora_14_7,Whew...
d_counseling_flora_14_8,Ha...
d_counseling_flora_14_9,I'm feeling a little better now.
d_counseling_flora_14_10,"Thank you, Blossom."
d_counseling_flora_14_11,I... I...
d_counseling_flora_14_12,"*Gasp*... *Cough, cough*!"
d_counseling_flora_14_13,Wa-wait...!
d_counseling_flora_14_14,"*Cough*... *Cough, cough*!"
d_counseling_flora_14_15,Flora takes some time to collect herself.
d_counseling_flora_15_title,Advising Flora: 15
d_counseling_flora_15_1,"Whenever I'm talking with the flowers,"
d_counseling_flora_15_2,I feel this wonderful sense of tranquility.
d_counseling_flora_15_3,Even though you aren't certain what they are saying?
d_counseling_flora_15_4,I know what you mean. It feels therapeutic in a way.
d_counseling_flora_15_5,Yes.
d_counseling_flora_15_6,"In fact, that almost makes it more comforting."
d_counseling_flora_15_7,Since I can use my imagination.
d_counseling_flora_15_8,"Haha, that's right."
d_counseling_flora_15_9,I knew that you would understand.
d_counseling_flora_15_10,You no longer find
d_counseling_flora_15_11,communicating with the little ones difficult anymore.
d_counseling_flora_15_12,I'm so glad to see that.
d_counseling_flora_15_13,Flora and I continue to discuss flowers.
d_counseling_flora_16_title,Advising Flora: 16
d_counseling_flora_16_1,"What's your favorite kind of weather, Blossom?"
d_counseling_flora_16_2,I like all kinds of weather.

d_counseling_flora_17_1,Blossom.
d_counseling_flora_17_2,Don't you think the flowers that grow on the surface are amazing?
d_counseling_flora_17_3,How so?
d_counseling_flora_17_4,"Absolutely, since they've managed to survive in such a volatile environment."
d_counseling_flora_17_5,"They haven't received any special care,"
d_counseling_flora_17_6,and yet they are able to survive naturally all on their own.
d_counseling_flora_17_7,"To me, that's a remarkable thing."
d_counseling_flora_17_8,Exactly.
d_counseling_flora_17_9,It's impressive that they survived
d_counseling_flora_17_10,and overcame such difficult conditions all on their own.

d_counseling_flora_19_1,People often ask me
d_counseling_flora_19_2,how much water they should give to flowers.
d_counseling_flora_19_3,It's not that hard. You just water them until it's enough.
d_counseling_flora_19_4,Shouldn't you just ask the flowers directly?
d_counseling_flora_19_5,"If you tell people that, they get confused."
d_counseling_flora_19_6,"After all, everyone's idea of enough is different."
d_counseling_flora_19_7,"Haha, yes. That's right."
d_counseling_flora_19_8,I know that you do that as well.
d_counseling_flora_19_9,"You check in with the little ones, ask how much water they want,"
d_counseling_flora_19_10,and then give them precisely that much.
d_counseling_flora_19_11,"Of course, many people find it difficult to speak with the little ones, so it's not always easy."

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_02_4,"It suits you well, but can you really go into battle dressed like that?"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_02_5,It's sublime. Utter perfection. No further customization needed.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_02_6,"It doesn't hinder my movements in any way, so that won't be a problem."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_02_7,So you think it looks good on me?

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_4,Someone who lives up to everyone's expectations.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_5,Someone who carves out their own path.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_6,A hero is bound to carry the hopes and dreams of others.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_7,"Countless heroes shoulder that burden and march forward,"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_8,but only a few will ever reach the end of their path.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_9,Most will be crushed by the weight of those expectations.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_10,Heh... It's a fate most harsh.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_11,"Right. It's about living according to your own beliefs,"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_12,rather than according to the expectations of others.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_03_13,That is what a true hero is.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_04_8,You're right. There's no need to worry about such trivialities.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_04_9,I'd be better off spending that time dealing with the remnants of the Big O.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_04_10,I know it all too well.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_04_12,"Nevertheless, so long as I carry the name of a hero,"

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_4,Guillotine places a large bowl on the table.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_5,"Inside, a blood-red liquid bubbles and froths."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_6,This soup was recommended by the Green-Eyed Culinary Murderer.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_7,Will you face this challenge together with me?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_8,"From a distance, I feel a warm yet menacing gaze."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_05_9,I cover Guillotine's eyes and pour the soup into her mouth.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_2,Something's been weighing on my mind.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_3,I know someone who keeps using words I can't understand.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_4,"They spend all their time alone, and never make any friends."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_5,How do I help them?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_6,... Are you talking about yourself?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_7,"If they're fine with who they are, then there's no need to fix them."

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_10,"I was talking about Maiden,"

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_13,... Do you think so?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_14_14,But they don't look happy.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_4,Someone who is helpful to the party.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_5,Someone who I get along with.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_6,I'm all the party needs!
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_7,What matters more is a companion who enjoys being in your presence.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_8,Going on an adventure is all about sharing it with someone you get along with.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_9,Right. The most important thing in an adventure is finding a companion who you get along with.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_15_10,"In that sense, I suppose I'm quite fortunate."

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_16_4,"First, you must be able to stand proudly on your own two feet."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_16_5,"You're already enough, just as you are."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_16_6,Am I able to do that...?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_16_7,That's a question I need to be confident in answering.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_16_8,Thanks for your advice.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_17_6,Heh.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_17_7,"If I, Guillotine de Mephisto, were to unleash my full potential, defeating Ice Rose would be easy."
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_17_8,"However, it is precisely because I must hold myself back"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_17_9,that I will never best her.

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_3,"Should I start with an easy quest,"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_4,or should I jump straight to the most difficult one they're offering?
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_5,Start off with the easy one and improve yourself.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_6,Go straight for the master rank quest. Anything else is a waste of time.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_7,"Start with the easy ones, you think?"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_18_8,"No, our party has no need for such simple quests."

d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_5,... She would honor her role as your friend.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_6,I hope so.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_7,"Members of the Extrinsic must separate personal and professional matters,"
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_8,and remain calm and collected while they fight for the Ark.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_9,... Heh. I'm not so sure Maiden could do it.
d_counseling_guillotine_winterslayer_19_10,... Heh. That's what I think Maiden would do as well.

d_counseling_rapi_redhood_01_4,It's not good to be greedy.

d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_5,Thank you.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_6,I was worried I'd have to go with Anis and Neon.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_7,They always beg me to buy all manner of unnecessary things.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_8,Stuff for the Commander's Room?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_9,"As far as toiletries are concerned, you can use the same ones that I buy."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_10,"For office supplies, I can go to the usual place that I order from..."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_11,"Okay, got it. I'll be back."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_12_12,"Later, I sort through the various supplies that Rapi purchased for me."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 13
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_1,"I overheard some Nikkes having a conversation,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_2,and they said that my personality has changed a lot recently.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_3,"Do you think so too, Comander?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_4,"Yes, but I think it's a positive change."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_5,I haven't noticed anything different about you.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_6,That... must be
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_7,due to the squadmates who are alongside me.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_8,There's a saying that goes:
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_9,We are shaped by those around us.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_10,Oh... really?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_11,Anis brought up the notion of a personality test.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_12,Would you like to try it with me?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_13,The one we did during a previous session? Sure.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_14,I spend time with Rapi doing the personality type test.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_13_15,The results are different from last time.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 14
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_1,...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_2,Rapi is intently focused on choosing a song on the jukebox.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_3,Can't decide?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_4,"I've been listening to different genres of music to try and figure out my preferences,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_5,but I'm still not sure what I like.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_6,"What kind of music do you enjoy most, Commander?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_7,Country music.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_8,EDM.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_9,Hmm...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_10,"That's not usually what I go for,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_11,"but since you're a fan, I'll play a song."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_12,EDM you say?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_13,That's a new genre that I haven't heard before.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_14,Okay. I will give it a try.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_14_15,"Rapi and I spend some time sitting in front of the jukebox, listening to music."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 15
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_1,"Do you have any long-term goals, Commander?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_2,To live a peaceful life.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_3,To reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_4,"The fact that we're able to have peaceful, everyday moments like this"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_5,is a testament to how hard we've strived.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_6,"I want your goals to become a reality,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_7,so I will do everything in my power to reclaim the surface.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_8,"If there is something you want, you should work hard for it."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_9,I'll work together with you
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_10,to make that dream happen.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_15_11,Rapi and I dream of a distant future.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 16
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_1,...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_2,Rapi stares intently at the top of the desk.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_3,What are you looking at?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_4,I was looking at the photo.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_5,I didn't expect it to be here.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_6,Let's take more in the future.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_7,Wouldn't it be nice to have some more photos beside it?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_8,"Yes, I'd like that."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_9,"Every time I see this one, I feel disappointed at how awkward I look in it."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_10,"Having said that, since it's the first photo that we took of just us two,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_11,I will always cherish it.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_12,It would.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_13,"Next time, I would like to take one with Anis and Neon as well."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_14,"And, if possible, another one of just the two of us."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_16_15,Rapi and I share a lighthearted conversation.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 17
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_1,"Yesterday, Neon offered to help me with my paperwork."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_2,...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_3,She also showed me how more hands can sometimes mean more work.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_4,"Well, it's the thought that counts."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_5,I'll help out next time.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_6,True...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_7,But there are times where I'd like to accept the thought only.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_8,Especially when it comes to work-related matters.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_9,"Thank you for the offer,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_10,but it would be more efficient if you were to spend time with Neon whenever she offers to help me.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_11,That would be a greater help.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_17_12,I listen to Rapi's work-related concerns.

d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_1,...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_2,Rapi stares intently at the top of the desk.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_3,What are you looking at?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_4,The mirror.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_5,"Commander,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_6,"do you prefer me as I was before, or who I am now?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_7,Who you were before.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_8,Who you are now.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_9,I see.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_10,I think otherwise.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_11,"I like the current me. Unlike before, I have my own stories now."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_12,I think so too.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_13,"I like the current me. Unlike before, I have my own stories now."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_14,I would love for us to continue spending more time together.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_15,I want you to see how my story unfolds.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_18_16,Rapi and I have a heartfelt conversation.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 19
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_1,Do you think
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_2,"there is a meaning in past glories, Commander?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_3,I think they hold great meaning.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_4,"I don't think they amount to much, no."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_5,"Without past glories, there wouldn't be a present."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_6,"As long as you are not trapped by them,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_7,"and continue moving forward to find your own path,"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_8,previous accomplishments will always shine bright.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_9,Really?
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_10,I think that the only reason the present exists is due to past glories.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_11,That's precisely what allows us to decide to move forward.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_12,"As long as you're not held back by them, past glories absolutely hold significance."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_19_13,Rapi and I have a profound conversation.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_title,Advising Rapi: Red Hood: 20
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_1,...
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_2,Rapi is closely examining Seven Dwarves Zero.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_3,"What's on your mind, Rapi?"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_4,I was thinking about how amazing this weapon is.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_5,"It's an incredibly powerful weapon, especially the drill bit projectile."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_6,"It's well-suited for Red Hood, that's for certain."
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_7,I get the same impression whenever I glance at it.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_8,"And so, I will do everything in my power to ensure that"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_9,this weapon I've inherited can fulfill its role.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_10,Yes. I think so too.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_11,"And so, I will do everything in my power to ensure that"
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_12,this weapon is a good fit for me as well.
d_counseling_rapi_redhood_20_13,Rapi and I talk about weapons.
d_counseling_trina_01_title,Advising Trina: 01
d_counseling_trina_01_1,"The more clothing you wear,"
d_counseling_trina_01_2,the farther you drift from nature.
d_counseling_trina_01_3,"To avoid that, we must make a concerted effort to free ourselves from this fabric prison."
d_counseling_trina_01_4,Maybe I'll join you.
d_counseling_trina_01_5,But what about having a sense of dignity?
d_counseling_trina_01_6,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_trina_01_7,I knew you would understand.
d_counseling_trina_01_8,I can't wait for the day you join me.
d_counseling_trina_01_9,What about it?
d_counseling_trina_01_10,We're simply returning to the natural state we were born in.
d_counseling_trina_01_11,There's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.
d_counseling_trina_01_12,I listen to Trina's thoughts on clothing.
d_counseling_trina_02_title,Advising Trina: 02
d_counseling_trina_02_1,There are quite a few trees by the roadside here in the Ark.
d_counseling_trina_02_2,"How do they look to you, Sun?"
d_counseling_trina_02_3,They look very pretty and neatly arranged.
d_counseling_trina_02_4,They seem somewhat stifled.
d_counseling_trina_02_5,Hmm... is that so?
d_counseling_trina_02_6,I suppose they might appear that way at a cursory glance.
d_counseling_trina_02_7,"But if you listen closely to what they tell you, I think your thoughts would change rather quickly."
d_counseling_trina_02_8,I think so too.
d_counseling_trina_02_9,"They've been stripped of their freedom,"
d_counseling_trina_02_10,and they're unable to stretch their roots and branches out like they want to.
d_counseling_trina_02_11,Trina and I talk more about the trees lining the roadside.
d_counseling_trina_03_title,Advising Trina: 03
d_counseling_trina_03_1,I had a dream yesterday.
d_counseling_trina_03_2,"I was running away from someone,"
d_counseling_trina_03_3,"and when they caught me, I transformed into a laurel tree."
d_counseling_trina_03_4,What a pleasant dream.
d_counseling_trina_03_5,What an awful nightmare.
d_counseling_trina_03_6,"Haha, you're right."
d_counseling_trina_03_7,It really was an exciting and delightful dream.
d_counseling_trina_03_8,It felt like I had fully become one with nature.
d_counseling_trina_03_9,Is that what you think?
d_counseling_trina_03_10,"For me, being able to connect with nature, even if only in a dream,"
d_counseling_trina_03_11,was an immensely satisfying experience.
d_counseling_trina_03_12,"In fact, I'd love to have that dream again."
d_counseling_trina_03_13,Trina and I discuss the dreams we had the previous night.
d_counseling_trina_04_title,Advising Trina: 04
d_counseling_trina_04_1,"I'm due to have a counseling session with Trina soon, but I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open."
d_counseling_trina_04_2,It shouldn't be a big deal if I have a short rest.
d_counseling_trina_04_3,...!
d_counseling_trina_04_4,"When I re-open my eyes, my head is resting on Trina's lap."
d_counseling_trina_04_5,You're finally awake again.
d_counseling_trina_04_6,"If you're tired, how about you take it easy for today?"
d_counseling_trina_04_7,"Okay, I'll rest just a little while longer."
d_counseling_trina_04_8,"No, I should finish our session."
d_counseling_trina_04_9,Have a proper rest and fight off that fatigue.
d_counseling_trina_04_10,"Hehe, you were sleeping so peacefully. You looked like a baby."
d_counseling_trina_04_11,"Hehe, I figured you would say that."
d_counseling_trina_04_12,"But my offer still stands; whenever you're feeling exhausted, my lap is all yours."
d_counseling_trina_04_13,"Afterward, I have a shortened counseling session with Trina."
d_counseling_trina_05_title,Advising Trina: 05
d_counseling_trina_05_1,The birds above my head all have different personalities.
d_counseling_trina_05_2,"This means they often quarrel, but they always stick close to me."
d_counseling_trina_05_3,"Haha, even though I see them every day, they never cease to intrigue me."
d_counseling_trina_05_4,Maybe they mistook you for a nest.
d_counseling_trina_05_5,You're their family.
d_counseling_trina_05_6,"Oh, that could be it."
d_counseling_trina_05_7,"My body is often a resting place for them, after all."
d_counseling_trina_05_8,Oh my goodness!
d_counseling_trina_05_9,"People often throw around the term ""pet"" when I bring them up, but that's the first time someone has called them family."
d_counseling_trina_05_10,"You always find a way to touch my heart, Sun."
d_counseling_trina_05_11,I talk with Trina about the birds above her head.
d_counseling_trina_06_title,Advising Trina: 06
d_counseling_trina_06_1,"Sun, what's the first thing you'd like to do if you reclaim the surface?"
d_counseling_trina_06_2,"I want to feel the vastness of nature, which is something we can't do in the Ark."
d_counseling_trina_06_3,I'd plant an apple tree.
d_counseling_trina_06_4,I'd do the same!
d_counseling_trina_06_5,"What would it be like to immerse oneself in untouched natural surroundings, free from human interference for so long?"
d_counseling_trina_06_6,"When that day comes, please take me with you."
d_counseling_trina_06_7,"That's a lovely gesture,"
d_counseling_trina_06_8,but won't there already be plenty of trees up on the surface?
d_counseling_trina_06_9,I would want to talk to those trees first.
d_counseling_trina_06_10,Trina and I discuss what we'd like to do up on the surface.
d_counseling_trina_07_title,Advising Trina: 07
d_counseling_trina_07_1,"People sometimes say that I seem like an airhead,"
d_counseling_trina_07_2,or they feel that I'm hiding something sinister behind my friendly demeanor.
d_counseling_trina_07_3,Should I try and make some changes to how I act?
d_counseling_trina_07_4,It might be worth trying.
d_counseling_trina_07_5,Just take your time and let people know who you really are.
d_counseling_trina_07_6,But this is who I am.
d_counseling_trina_07_7,"If I changed my entire personality, then I wouldn't be me anymore."
d_counseling_trina_07_8,"And even if I did decide to change, I wouldn't know which direction to take."
d_counseling_trina_07_9,"Hehe, you're right."
d_counseling_trina_07_10,I just want to prove to people that this is who I really am.
d_counseling_trina_07_11,Trina and I talk about her true nature.
d_counseling_trina_08_title,Advising Trina: 08
d_counseling_trina_08_1,I want to give a treat to the trees by the side of the road.
d_counseling_trina_08_2,What do you think would be good?
d_counseling_trina_08_3,How about some liquid fertilizer?
d_counseling_trina_08_4,"Orange juice, maybe?"
d_counseling_trina_08_5,!
d_counseling_trina_08_6,The trees would love that!
d_counseling_trina_08_7,"Thanks for the suggestion, Sun. I'll start preparing it straight away!"
d_counseling_trina_08_8,...
d_counseling_trina_08_9,"Maybe you're not as caring as I thought, Sun..."
d_counseling_trina_08_10,Trina and I debate on what would make a nice treat for the trees by the roadside.
d_counseling_trina_09_title,Advising Trina: 09
d_counseling_trina_09_1,All the trees at the Outpost have their own unique traits.
d_counseling_trina_09_2,"Is there any tree that stands out in your memory, Sun?"
d_counseling_trina_09_3,I'm not sure. They all look pretty similar to me.
d_counseling_trina_09_4,The small tree in the park.
d_counseling_trina_09_5,"Hmm, I see."
d_counseling_trina_09_6,"If you take a closer look, I'm sure you'll notice some differentiation between them."
d_counseling_trina_09_7,I'll tell you all about it next time.
d_counseling_trina_09_8,"Oh, you know that tree?"
d_counseling_trina_09_9,"It is diminutive, but so full of spirit and determination."
d_counseling_trina_09_10,"Next time I see her, I'll have to tell her we were talking about her."
d_counseling_trina_09_11,Trina and I continue to discuss trees we find memorable.
d_counseling_trina_10_title,Advising Trina: 10
d_counseling_trina_10_1,"What's the first thing that you associate with trees, Sun?"
d_counseling_trina_10_2,You can be honest with me.
d_counseling_trina_10_3,Warmth and comfort.
d_counseling_trina_10_4,Rigidity.
d_counseling_trina_10_5,That's exactly how I feel!
d_counseling_trina_10_6,"In nature, trees are wellsprings of vitality, nurturing all life around them."
d_counseling_trina_10_7,"If we were to compare them to people, wouldn't they take on the role of a mother?"
d_counseling_trina_10_8,"Haha, I think that's a fair way to look at it."
d_counseling_trina_10_9,"But if you observe them a bit more closely,"
d_counseling_trina_10_10,you'll notice that there are surprisingly tender and delicate aspects to trees as well.
d_counseling_trina_10_11,Trina and I talk about the sensations that trees evoke in us.

d_counseling_trina_11_3,Hike her clothes back up.
d_counseling_trina_11_4,Wait quietly.
d_counseling_trina_11_5,"Huh? Are you trying to stop me, Sun?"
d_counseling_trina_11_6,Haha.
d_counseling_trina_11_7,"I know you're doing it out of concern, so it does feel rather sweet."
d_counseling_trina_11_8,"You must enjoy being close to nature as well, don't you?"
d_counseling_trina_11_9,How about joining me?
d_counseling_trina_11_10,...
d_counseling_trina_11_11,Today's counseling session with Trina ends quickly.
d_counseling_trina_12_title,Advising Trina: 12
d_counseling_trina_12_1,"Sometimes, the little ones wonder what it would be like up on the surface."
d_counseling_trina_12_2,"I understand their eagerness,"
d_counseling_trina_12_3,but the climate on the surface is much harsher than it is in the Ark.
d_counseling_trina_12_4,"The little ones have already adjusted to this environment, but I worry that their hopes of seeing the surface will be dashed."
d_counseling_trina_12_5,"I want to help them prepare themselves mentally, but how should I go about it?"
d_counseling_trina_12_6,How about telling them stories about the surface?
d_counseling_trina_12_7,Let's take them up to the surface and give them an experience.
d_counseling_trina_12_8,"Ah, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_trina_12_9,"That way, they'll understand that the world can be a harsh place,"
d_counseling_trina_12_10,and it won't catch them by surprise.
d_counseling_trina_12_11,"But wouldn't that scare them, doing it all so suddenly?"
d_counseling_trina_12_12,"I realize they seem strong, but they're still quite tender at heart."
d_counseling_trina_12_13,I believe we should introduce these things to them slowly.
d_counseling_trina_12_14,I talk with Trina bout how to help trees grow from within.
d_counseling_trina_13_title,Advising Trina: 13
d_counseling_trina_13_1,Sun...
d_counseling_trina_13_2,What's wrong?
d_counseling_trina_13_3,"One of the trees passed away suddenly, even though it seemed perfectly fine not long ago."
d_counseling_trina_13_4,... Maybe I don't have what it takes.
d_counseling_trina_13_5,You should pay closer attention to their health.
d_counseling_trina_13_6,"That tree will become nourishment for the others. In that way, it will live on in a different form."
d_counseling_trina_13_7,I know... I ought to try communicating more with them from now on.
d_counseling_trina_13_8,There might be others who are hiding their pain.
d_counseling_trina_13_9,... That's true.
d_counseling_trina_13_10,"Even in death, that tree will be of help to someone, so I shouldn't dwell only on the sadness."
d_counseling_trina_13_11,"Thank you, Sun. Your words comforted me a lot."
d_counseling_trina_13_12,Trina and I talk about the death of a tree.

d_counseling_trina_14_1,The birds above Trina's head flap about expectantly.
d_counseling_trina_14_2,Don't they seem positively ecstatic?
d_counseling_trina_14_3,They do seem more excited than usual.
d_counseling_trina_14_4,"That's because once this session is done, we'll be stopping by Flora's garden."
d_counseling_trina_14_5,The little ones always look forward to these visits.
d_counseling_trina_14_6,Do they get treats whenever they visit?
d_counseling_trina_14_7,Maybe it's Flora that they like.
d_counseling_trina_14_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_trina_14_9,"Every time we stop by, Flora prepares some delicious snacks for them."
d_counseling_trina_14_10,"Haha, I wonder what she has in store for them today?"
d_counseling_trina_14_11,"Haha, while they certainly are fans of Flora,"
d_counseling_trina_14_12,I think it's something else that gets them so excited.
d_counseling_trina_14_13,Trina tells me more about the birds that encircle her head.
d_counseling_trina_15_title,Advising Trina: 15
d_counseling_trina_15_1,Trina brings a small bonsai tree to the session.
d_counseling_trina_15_2,I've been tending to this little one personally.
d_counseling_trina_15_3,"It said it has something it wants to tell you, Sun."
d_counseling_trina_15_4,Would you like to hear it?
d_counseling_trina_15_5,Sure... but I can't really hear anything.
d_counseling_trina_15_6,"Hello, what's the matter?"
d_counseling_trina_15_7,"""Try cleaning out your ears once in a while,"
d_counseling_trina_15_8,"you insensitive human."""
d_counseling_trina_15_9,?
d_counseling_trina_15_10,... That's what the little one said.
d_counseling_trina_15_11,What did it say?
d_counseling_trina_15_12,It's a secret.
d_counseling_trina_15_13,"Ha, so now you two have your own little secret?"
d_counseling_trina_15_14,I think I might be a little jealous!
d_counseling_trina_15_15,I have a conversation with the tree Trina brought.
d_counseling_trina_16_title,Advising Trina: 16
d_counseling_trina_16_1,"Sun, what do you think about having to trim a tree which has superfluous branches?"
d_counseling_trina_16_2,Is it the right thing to do?
d_counseling_trina_16_3,They need to be pruned.
d_counseling_trina_16_4,There's no such thing as an unnecessary branch.
d_counseling_trina_16_5,"You're not necessarily wrong, but..."
d_counseling_trina_16_6,"If a tree, which cannot speak, slowly extends its branches over time, only to have them cut away in an instant,"
d_counseling_trina_16_7,don't you find that terribly sad?
d_counseling_trina_16_8,I feel the same way.
d_counseling_trina_16_9,The very act of exerting itself in order to extend its branches...
d_counseling_trina_16_10,I wonder if there's a reason behind it.
d_counseling_trina_16_11,That's why I always feel a little sorry when I have to prune the trees by the roadside.
d_counseling_trina_16_12,"Trina and I talk more about ""unnecessary"" branches."
d_counseling_trina_17_title,Advising Trina: 17
d_counseling_trina_17_1,The weather is so nice today.
d_counseling_trina_17_2,How about we skip our session and go outside to soak up some sun instead?
d_counseling_trina_17_3,"Sure, but let's go after our session."
d_counseling_trina_17_4,I feel like staying indoors today.
d_counseling_trina_17_5,"Wow, I didn't think you'd agree so easily."
d_counseling_trina_17_6,"You always seem so busy, so I thought you'd say no."
d_counseling_trina_17_7,"Hehe, I can't wait to finish quickly and go outside together."
d_counseling_trina_17_8,"Staying indoors all the time isn't good for you, you know."
d_counseling_trina_17_9,"I heard you've been sequestered in your room for days, working on documents."
d_counseling_trina_17_10,How about getting some fresh air?
d_counseling_trina_17_11,"... All right, I'll do that."
d_counseling_trina_17_12,Even a little bit of time outside will do you a world of good.
d_counseling_trina_17_13,"After our session is over, Trina and I head outside to get some sun."
d_counseling_trina_18_title,Advising Trina: 18
d_counseling_trina_18_1,"Sometimes, when I need to check the branches of larger trees, I'm not sure how to proceed."
d_counseling_trina_18_2,I feel like I might hurt the trees if I climb all over them...
d_counseling_trina_18_3,Do you have any suggestions?
d_counseling_trina_18_4,How about using a drone?
d_counseling_trina_18_5,Why don't you recruit those birds?
d_counseling_trina_18_6,"I've tried that,"
d_counseling_trina_18_7,but it's difficult to get close to the denser trees.
d_counseling_trina_18_8,Hmm... this is a real conundrum.
d_counseling_trina_18_9,"Oh my, that's a great idea!"
d_counseling_trina_18_10,"These birds are small and nimble, so they could check even the deepest recesses of the trees without issue."
d_counseling_trina_18_11,"And in return, I could prepare some tasty treats for them."
d_counseling_trina_18_12,I'll have to ask them for help later.
d_counseling_trina_18_13,Trina and I talk about different ways she could inspect the branches of larger trees.
d_counseling_trina_19_title,Advising Trina: 19
d_counseling_trina_19_1,*Huff*... *huff*...
d_counseling_trina_19_2,"Sun, could you... please give me some water?"
d_counseling_trina_19_3,All right.
d_counseling_trina_19_4,I bring Trina a glass of water.
d_counseling_trina_19_5,"Trina is pouring sweat, so I bring her an electrolyte drink instead of plain water."
d_counseling_trina_19_6,"Phew... thanks, Sun."
d_counseling_trina_19_7,"On the way here, I saw a tree that was absolutely parched."
d_counseling_trina_19_8,"I'll go give it some water, and be right back."
d_counseling_trina_19_9,Huh? Oh...
d_counseling_trina_19_10,I didn't mean for me. It's for a tree.
d_counseling_trina_19_11,Could you give me some plain water?
d_counseling_trina_19_12,Trina and I commence our counseling session only after she returns from watering the tree.
d_counseling_trina_20_title,Advising Trina: 20
d_counseling_trina_20_1,Trina is speaking with the birds.
d_counseling_trina_20_2,"Oh, that's right!"
d_counseling_trina_20_3,Didn't you say yesterday that you had something to tell Sun?
d_counseling_trina_20_4,Huh?
d_counseling_trina_20_5,"Hey, you guys?"
d_counseling_trina_20_6,Do they not want to talk to me?
d_counseling_trina_20_7,Maybe they're feeling shy?
d_counseling_trina_20_8,"No, that can't be it."
d_counseling_trina_20_9,Hmm... that's strange.
d_counseling_trina_20_10,They were positively loquacious all day yesterday.
d_counseling_trina_20_11,"I'm sorry, Sun. I guess the birds are feeling a little shy."
d_counseling_trina_20_12,!!
d_counseling_trina_20_13,"That seems to be the case, yes."
d_counseling_trina_20_14,Are you all too nervous to talk to Sun?
d_counseling_trina_20_15,"Haha, how adorable."
d_counseling_trina_20_16,I try talking with the birds above Trina's head.
d_counseling_mana_01_title,Advising Mana: 01
d_counseling_mana_01_1,Commander...
d_counseling_mana_01_2,Are you someone who tends to trust people easily?
d_counseling_mana_01_3,"Yes, I am."
d_counseling_mana_01_4,"No, I'm not."
d_counseling_mana_01_5,I thought so.
d_counseling_mana_01_6,"That's not necessarily a bad thing,"
d_counseling_mana_01_7,but I believe maintaining an appropriate distance from others can be wise.
d_counseling_mana_01_8,"Not everyone in the world is good, after all."
d_counseling_mana_01_9,"I'm surprised to hear you say that,"
d_counseling_mana_01_10,but I think that's actually a good thing.
d_counseling_mana_01_11,"Not everyone in the world is good, after all."
d_counseling_mana_01_12,"I'm the same as you, Commander. I don't trust people easily."
d_counseling_mana_01_13,I tend to keep people at a reasonable distance.
d_counseling_mana_01_14,Mana and I talk about people.
d_counseling_mana_02_title,Advising Mana: 02
d_counseling_mana_02_1,"They say that everyone has their secrets,"
d_counseling_mana_02_2,but it's rare to find someone with many secrets.
d_counseling_mana_02_3,"Commander, what are your thoughts on people who have a lot of secrets?"
d_counseling_mana_02_4,It can be quite difficult to befriend such people.
d_counseling_mana_02_5,I don't feel the need to know all of someone's secrets.
d_counseling_mana_02_6,... I see.
d_counseling_mana_02_7,I don't think it's necessary to know every last secret to get close to someone.
d_counseling_mana_02_8,There are many ways to build relationships with people in this world.
d_counseling_mana_02_9,It seems we think alike.
d_counseling_mana_02_10,"I, too, believe there's no need to know all of someone else's secrets, nor to reveal all of your own."
d_counseling_mana_02_11,"Also, the more of someone's secrets that you know,"
d_counseling_mana_02_12,"the more burdens you'll have to bear, and all it does is make you think more deeply."
d_counseling_mana_02_13,Mana and I talk about secrets.

d_counseling_mana_03_1,"Commander, what topic would you like to..."
d_counseling_mana_03_2,*Buzz buzz*
d_counseling_mana_03_3,"Sorry, I'm getting a call..."
d_counseling_mana_03_4,Go ahead and take it.
d_counseling_mana_03_5,"Okay, thanks."
d_counseling_mana_03_6,Hello?
d_counseling_mana_03_7,...
d_counseling_mana_03_8,A tense voice comes through the receiver.
d_counseling_mana_03_9,"...*Sigh* Yes, I'll head over right away to make the corrections."
d_counseling_mana_03_10,Pat Mana's shoulder to reassure her.
d_counseling_mana_03_11,Want to grab a drink?
d_counseling_mana_03_12,... Thank you.
d_counseling_mana_03_13,"I'm sorry, but could we possibly end our session early today?"
d_counseling_mana_03_14,"There's a document that needs correcting, and it's urgent."
d_counseling_mana_03_15,A drink?
d_counseling_mana_03_16,...
d_counseling_mana_03_17,"Sure, but is it okay if I stop by the lab real quick first?"
d_counseling_mana_03_18,I'll make a few quick revisions to the document and return shortly.
d_counseling_mana_03_19,Mana and I have a pleasant counseling session together.
d_counseling_mana_04_title,Advising Mana: 04
d_counseling_mana_04_1,We're undergoing performance reviews at the research lab tomorrow.
d_counseling_mana_04_2,I've never been nervous before... until now.
d_counseling_mana_04_3,"This presentation is really important, and I can't help but feel really stressed."
d_counseling_mana_04_4,I'll send you some motivating messages.
d_counseling_mana_04_5,Would you like to run through your presentation with me?
d_counseling_mana_04_6,"If I saw an encouraging message from you before my presentation,"
d_counseling_mana_04_7,I feel like I'd be a little less nervous.
d_counseling_mana_04_8,"Hehe, thank you."
d_counseling_mana_04_9,Right here? Now?
d_counseling_mana_04_10,...
d_counseling_mana_04_11,"In that case, could you sit there with a stern expression on your face?"
d_counseling_mana_04_12,Most of the audience members who listen to these presentations are fairly unsmiling.
d_counseling_mana_04_13,Mana and I have a meaningful session together.
d_counseling_mana_05_title,Advising Mana: 05
d_counseling_mana_05_1,"Hmm? You look particularly tired today, Commander."
d_counseling_mana_05_2,Have you not been able to sleep well?
d_counseling_mana_05_3,Want to grab a coffee?
d_counseling_mana_05_4,You look like you haven't slept much either. Are you okay?
d_counseling_mana_05_5,"I'd love to, but a lot of work has been piling up."
d_counseling_mana_05_6,How about you take a short nap?
d_counseling_mana_05_7,"I brought my tablet with me, so I'll be fine sitting here working."
d_counseling_mana_05_8,How did you know?
d_counseling_mana_05_9,I've been up for two nights straight.
d_counseling_mana_05_10,*Clink*
d_counseling_mana_05_11,Mana places a drink on the desk.
d_counseling_mana_05_12,This is an energy drink I often have when I'm working. It might help you a bit.
d_counseling_mana_05_13,Let's drink it together.
d_counseling_mana_05_14,"I continue our session, fighting off sleep the entire time."
d_counseling_mana_06_title,Advising Mana: 06
d_counseling_mana_06_1,I've been under a lot of stress lately.
d_counseling_mana_06_2,"How do you relieve stress, Commander?"
d_counseling_mana_06_3,By exercising.
d_counseling_mana_06_4,By sleeping.
d_counseling_mana_06_5,"I've heard that exercising is good for stress relief,"
d_counseling_mana_06_6,"but Nikkes don't actually require exercise, so I'm not sure how much it will help."
d_counseling_mana_06_7,"Either way, I suppose I should give it a try."
d_counseling_mana_06_8,Maybe I should head over to Body X Body?
d_counseling_mana_06_9,"That's what I've done in the past,"
d_counseling_mana_06_10,"but lately, not even sleeping has helped, which worries me."
d_counseling_mana_06_11,Hmm...
d_counseling_mana_06_12,I'll need to find another method.
d_counseling_mana_06_13,I talk with Mana about ways to relieve stress.
d_counseling_mana_07_title,Advising Mana: 07
d_counseling_mana_07_1,*Sigh*...
d_counseling_mana_07_2,"There's so much work to do. No matter how much I get done, it never ends."
d_counseling_mana_07_3,Could we finish today's session a bit earlier?
d_counseling_mana_07_4,Do you want me to help out?
d_counseling_mana_07_5,How about you use our counseling session as a chance to rest?
d_counseling_mana_07_6,"It would be a great help if you could,"
d_counseling_mana_07_7,but I deal with a lot of sensitive information that's highly classified.
d_counseling_mana_07_8,"I do appreciate the thought, though."
d_counseling_mana_07_9,But...
d_counseling_mana_07_10,"The busier you are, the more important rest becomes."
d_counseling_mana_07_11,...
d_counseling_mana_07_12,"You're the only one who really cares about me, Commander."
d_counseling_mana_07_13,Mana and I have a meaningful session together.

d_counseling_mana_08_1,I'm planning on taking a vacation for the first time in a while.
d_counseling_mana_08_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_mana_08_3,The only thing is...
d_counseling_mana_08_4,"It's been so long since my last vacation, I'm not exactly sure how to spend it."
d_counseling_mana_08_5,Would you like me to give some suggestions?
d_counseling_mana_08_6,How about wandering around here and there?
d_counseling_mana_08_7,!!
d_counseling_mana_08_8,Are you saying you'll spend your vacation with me?
d_counseling_mana_08_9,Would you rather I didn't?
d_counseling_mana_08_10,"Oh no, quite the opposite! I just know how busy you are, and I'm worried you doing that will make you even busier."
d_counseling_mana_08_11,It's fine.
d_counseling_mana_08_12,"... All right then, I'll take you up on that offer."
d_counseling_mana_08_13,Ether said something similar.
d_counseling_mana_08_14,"I guess I'll amble around the Ark first,"
d_counseling_mana_08_15,and maybe figure out what I want to do from there.
d_counseling_mana_08_16,Mana and I talk about vacations.

d_counseling_mana_09_1,"When a superior gives an unreasonable order,"
d_counseling_mana_09_2,what do you think is the right thing to do?
d_counseling_mana_09_3,"If the order doesn't significantly violate the rules, I suppose I'd follow it."
d_counseling_mana_09_4,You should stand up and resist.
d_counseling_mana_09_5,I think so too.
d_counseling_mana_09_6,I'd try to figure out what to do afterwards.
d_counseling_mana_09_7,"Whether to continue following their orders, stop here,"
d_counseling_mana_09_8,or perhaps try to persuade them to correct their course.
d_counseling_mana_09_9,"That would be fantastic, wouldn't it?"
d_counseling_mana_09_10,"But it's not that simple in real life, which is why I worry about it."
d_counseling_mana_09_11,Mana and I talk about superiors.
d_counseling_mana_10_title,Advising Mana: 10
d_counseling_mana_10_1,Ether and I were talking today about what we find attractive in other people.
d_counseling_mana_10_2,"What do you find most attractive in a girl, Commander?"
d_counseling_mana_10_3,"Someone smart and intellectual, but also with a good sense of humor and a pretty smile…"
d_counseling_mana_10_4,"Honestly, you're my type, Mana."
d_counseling_mana_10_5,"Ah,"
d_counseling_mana_10_6,I see...
d_counseling_mana_10_7,"You certainly have a very... specific type, Commander."
d_counseling_mana_10_8,"Commander, that was a serious question."
d_counseling_mana_10_9,I'd appreciate you not making jokes about it.
d_counseling_mana_10_10,I wasn't joking.
d_counseling_mana_10_11,...
d_counseling_mana_10_12,"Do you have a glass of cold water in here, by any chance?"
d_counseling_mana_10_13,I'm feeling warm.

d_counseling_mana_11_3,*Zing*
d_counseling_mana_11_4,"Sorry for being late, Commander. I had to take care of something."
d_counseling_mana_11_5,It's okay. Let's start the sess...
d_counseling_mana_11_6,*Sigh*
d_counseling_mana_11_7,Do you think we could have a drink?
d_counseling_mana_11_8,"Sure, I'll get us something."
d_counseling_mana_11_9,Right now may not be the best time...
d_counseling_mana_11_10,Don't trouble yourself. I brought some.
d_counseling_mana_11_11,... Oh.
d_counseling_mana_11_12,Something absurd happened at the lab today.
d_counseling_mana_11_13,Oh... that's too bad.
d_counseling_mana_11_14,Mana doesn't look too good.
d_counseling_mana_11_15,"On second thought, never mind. I'll go grab us some drinks."
d_counseling_mana_11_16,A moment later.
d_counseling_mana_11_17,*Bang*!
d_counseling_mana_11_18,You... You dunevenknow the half of it!
d_counseling_mana_11_19,If you knew... knew how hard it was!

d_counseling_mana_11_21,No! My life! My research! Those are my snacks!
d_counseling_mana_11_22,"Ugh... I've never gotten this drunk before... Commander, you can't tell anyone!"

d_counseling_mana_12_title,Advising Mana: 12
d_counseling_mana_12_1,Ether sometimes asks me if it's okay to quit.
d_counseling_mana_12_2,Do you think that's because she actually wants to quit?
d_counseling_mana_12_3,People who always go on about quitting usually never do.
d_counseling_mana_12_4,Tell Ether that you intend on quitting too.
d_counseling_mana_12_5,That's true.
d_counseling_mana_12_6,"She says it about 370 times a year,"
d_counseling_mana_12_7,but she's never gone ahead and actually done it. Not even once.
d_counseling_mana_12_8,"Judging by your reaction, Commander, I suppose I can ignore her like I usually do."
d_counseling_mana_12_9,Hold on now. I'm not the type to say things I don't mean.
d_counseling_mana_12_10,"Even if it may start as an empty phrase,"
d_counseling_mana_12_11,"the more you say it, the more you genuinely want it."

d_counseling_mana_13_6,Stay quiet.
d_counseling_mana_13_7,"Just a moment, Commander."
d_counseling_mana_13_8,I've got some urgent tasks to take care of.
d_counseling_mana_13_9,"Aw darn it, I accidentally deleted that section instead of editing it..."
d_counseling_mana_13_10,... Phew. Done.
d_counseling_mana_13_11,"Thanks for waiting, Commander."
d_counseling_mana_13_12,"Thanks to you being patient, I was able to finish my task on time."

d_counseling_mana_14_1,"Commander, what kind of dress do you think would suit me?"

d_counseling_mana_14_3,I thought it might be nice to have one or two different options.
d_counseling_mana_14_4,A halterneck dress.
d_counseling_mana_14_5,A shirt dress.
d_counseling_mana_14_6,Hmm...
d_counseling_mana_14_7,I've never tried on a dress like that before.
d_counseling_mana_14_8,"If you think it'd look good on me, I'll try wearing it next time."
d_counseling_mana_14_9,That doesn't seem all that different from what I'm wearing now...
d_counseling_mana_14_10,Are there any other kinds of dresses you can think of?

d_counseling_mana_15_6,...
d_counseling_mana_15_7,Uh... it's just...
d_counseling_mana_15_8,"It's fine, you don't have to explain. I'm sure you have a legitimate reason."
d_counseling_mana_15_9,"Anyway, thank you."
d_counseling_mana_15_10,"Oh no, please don't inconvenience yourself."
d_counseling_mana_15_11,Would it be okay if I simply take them off?
d_counseling_mana_15_12,Wearing ripped stockings would be terribly unseemly.
d_counseling_mana_15_13,Hmm?

d_counseling_mana_16_2,Effort or talent?
d_counseling_mana_16_3,Effort.
d_counseling_mana_16_4,Talent.
d_counseling_mana_16_5,I agree.
d_counseling_mana_16_6,"Even if you have incredible talent,"
d_counseling_mana_16_7,you won't be able to achieve anything without effort.
d_counseling_mana_16_8,"Talent is important too,"
d_counseling_mana_16_9,but I believe nothing can be achieved without effort.
d_counseling_mana_16_10,"Therefore, I think effort is more important."
d_counseling_mana_16_11,Mana and I talk about effort and talent.

d_counseling_mana_17_4,"... I'm fine with ""Commander""."
d_counseling_mana_17_5,You mean your actual name?
d_counseling_mana_17_6,... {AccountData.NickName}.
d_counseling_mana_17_7,...
d_counseling_mana_17_8,"Er... sorry, but I think it's better if we stick with the old title."
d_counseling_mana_17_9,I find it very comfortable and fitting as well.

d_counseling_mana_18_1,"When you're working and you hit a wall,"
d_counseling_mana_18_2,how do you usually overcome it?
d_counseling_mana_18_3,"I take a break and have a little snack, usually something like chocolate."
d_counseling_mana_18_4,I keep at it until I solve it.
d_counseling_mana_18_5,Chocolate is nice.
d_counseling_mana_18_6,Sweet things are said to help boost brain activity.
d_counseling_mana_18_7,I should stock up on chocolate on my way back.
d_counseling_mana_18_8,"In my case, if I keep getting stuck on a particular point,"
d_counseling_mana_18_9,I can end up getting too fixated on it.
d_counseling_mana_18_10,"You're amazing, Commander."

d_counseling_mana_19_1,I had to scrap a project I'd been working on for months.
d_counseling_mana_19_2,"Every time this happens, I realize just how difficult research can be."
d_counseling_mana_19_3,No job in this world is easy.
d_counseling_mana_19_4,That's what makes the sense of accomplishment when you succeed later even greater.
d_counseling_mana_19_5,"That's true,"
d_counseling_mana_19_6,but I had grown deeply attached to this project.
d_counseling_mana_19_7,"I really wanted it to be a success,"
d_counseling_mana_19_8,so it's only natural that I'd feel disappointed.
d_counseling_mana_19_9,I agree.
d_counseling_mana_19_10,"The tougher the research is, the more rewarding it feels when you eventually succeed."
d_counseling_mana_19_11,"That's why we always keep trying, even after our failures."
d_counseling_mana_19_12,One failure doesn't mean eternal failure.
d_counseling_mana_19_13,"In fact, sometimes it can be a shortcut to success."
d_counseling_mana_19_14,Mana and I talk about research.

d_counseling_mana_20_1,Do you have any tips for me on improving my social skills?
d_counseling_mana_20_2,"Research always has clear black-and-white answers,"
d_counseling_mana_20_3,"but when it comes to social interactions, the lack of clear solutions makes it quite difficult."
d_counseling_mana_20_4,You're already doing well.
d_counseling_mana_20_5,I don't know the answers either.
d_counseling_mana_20_6,You think I'm good at socializing?
d_counseling_mana_20_7,I still feel like I'm lacking in many areas.
d_counseling_mana_20_8,"... But thanks to you, I do feel a bit more at ease."
d_counseling_mana_20_9,"You too, Commander?"
d_counseling_mana_20_10,I've always thought of you as someone who is very skilled at socializing. I didn't expect you to find it difficult.
d_counseling_mana_20_11,I guess socializing can be challenging for everyone.
d_counseling_mana_20_12,But I do hope that my social skills can get to your level one day.

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_4,I liked your original outfit more.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_5,"Phew, I'm glad you like it!"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_6,A pirate and maid's style combined is a winning combo that not even you can resist!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_7,"I'll have to wear this more often for you, then."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_8,I can't believe it...!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_9,I thought for sure you'd really like this.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_01_10,I guess you're not into this kind of style. That's too bad.

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_title,Advising Mast: Romantic Maid: 02
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_1,I was thinking that Morgan would look better dressed up as a butler instead of a maid.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_2,"I mean, he's always adorable, but doesn't this make him even cuter?"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_3,I... don't think it works on him.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_4,He looks super cute.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_5,You stink! You stink!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_6,...
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_7,"Haha, looks like you got on Morgan's bad side, Master Captain."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_8,"If you ask me, I think he's adorable. I suppose everyone has their personal preferences."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_9,But the most important thing is that I think he's cute!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_10,You're cute too! You're cute too!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_11,... Thanks.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_12,"Haha, sounds like he's a fan of yours, Master Captain."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_02_13,"I'm not the only one who finds Morgan adorable, either."

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_3,What would you like to eat?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_4,"So long as it's you making it, I'll enjoy it."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_5,Something that goes well with rum.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_6,"Hmm... that's a bit open-ended, don't you think?"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_7,I'm not good at deciding these things on my own.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_8,Can't you be more specific?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_9,Now that's in my wheelhouse!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_10,I'll be able to prepare
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_03_11,"something extra delicious, no problem."

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_3,"I suppose I'd spend it normally, chatting with her like I am with you."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_4,I'd go to a Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_5,Hold on...
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_6,...
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_7,D-doesn't that mean...
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_04_8,"Er... is it me, or did it get hot in here all of a sudden?"

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_1,"Anchor has always been a cutie,"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_2,but don't you think she's even more alluring in a maid outfit?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_3,You're way cuter than her.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_4,You and Anchor are both cute.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_5,!!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_6,Y-you shouldn't say that kinda stuff to me out of the blue. It makes me feel awkward!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_7,"I appreciate the compliment, but we're talking about Anchor right now."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_8,I think so too!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_9,Everyone keeps complimenting us on how cute we are. It's a real confidence booster.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_05_10,Being complimented always feels better when you're getting praised in tandem.

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_2,She said that you come to the Maid Cafe all the time.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_3,Why do you visit that place so often?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_4,Because I feel lonely.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_5,Because it's such a romantic place.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_6,... Oh.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_7,I had no idea.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_8,"Um... I can visit the Commander's Room more often, so you won't feel as lonely."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_9,!!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_10,What a great answer! I love that!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_11,People should always seek places that are brimming with romantic energy.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_12,"After working there myself,"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_06_13,I can understand why people visit the Maid Cafe so often.

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_1,"I may be imagining things,"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_2,but it seems to me that Helm wants to wear a maid outfit as well.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_3,"Every time she looks at Anchor and me, her eyes are filled with envy."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_4,Why don't you lend her yours?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_5,Why don't you give her a maid outfit as a gift?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_6,I don't think that will work. I need to wear this every day.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_7,"Besides, I don't know if it would even fit her."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_8,...
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_9,It'd be better to get her one of her own.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_10,"I've earned a healthy chunk of change from working at the cafe, so it shouldn't be a problem."
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_11,That's what I was thinking.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_12,I think it would look nice if the entire Aegis Squad wore maid outfits together.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_13,"There's one in particular that I've had my eyes on, would you take a look with me?"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_07_14,I think that it would be really good on Helm.

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_08_16,Really?
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_08_17,Whew... that's a relief.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_08_18,"I know that I was the one who asked, but I was worried that you'd prefer being called by another title."

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_19_11,"Or Trony, maybe?"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_19_12,"Could it be Sin? No, cute isn't necessarily the word I'd use to describe her..."

d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_5,!!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_6,I didn't think you'd know such an iconic pirate quote!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_7,"When does a pirate die, I ask you?"
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_8,Not when their ship is captured.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_9,Nor when they're betrayed.
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_10,A pirate only perishes when their yearning for adventures dies!
d_counseling_mast_romanticmaid_20_11,"Wow, it's been ages since I met someone familiar with this quote!"

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_4,Be honest.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_5,They look delicious. They'll sell like hotcakes.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_6,Maybe you should rename them...
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_7,Do you think so?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_8,"I feel like there's something missing, a small finishing touch."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_9,But you think they're fine as is?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_10,Really? I thought the names were fine...
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_11,"Okay. You're giving me the customer's perspective,"
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_12,so I'll think of something else.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_02_13,What should I name them?

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_4,The Maid Cafe has more cleaning to do than the Admire.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_5,"Sorry, but I have to end the session here."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_6,"Sure, we can go until later tonight."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_7,...
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_8,How can you be so cold-hearted?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_9,You should learn to be kinder to people.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_10,"You're such a kind person, Master."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_03_11,Could you also call Mast for me and let her know that our session will be running long?

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_4,How about dressing it in green pants?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_5,Let's dress it up to look like you.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_6,Green pants? Isn't that a bit too close to that show...?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_7,I feel like I'd have to include a talking sponge and squid too.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_8,Er... I should probably stop there. Don't want to get in trouble.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_9,"At any rate, I don't think that will work."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_04_10,Like me?

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_3,"I want her to stop, but how?"
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_4,Touch her belly in the same way.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_5,Stick a starfish on your belly.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_6,"I tried that,"
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_7,but it completely backfired.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_8,All she did was go on about how her belly fat probably didn't feel as good as mine.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_9,Then she broke out laughing and kept teasing me. Just thinking about it is getting me fired up...
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_10,Oh! Why didn't I think of that?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_11,"You're so smart, Master."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_06_12,"In fact, I should stick on several, so there's no space left for her to poke."

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_5,Throw two at a time.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_6,Practice your starfish tossing more.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_7,Two at a time?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_8,That would be a coward's way out.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_9,I should practice my throwing skills instead.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_07_10,"You're right, I should."

d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_title,Advising Anchor: Innocent Maid: 20
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_1,"Master,"
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_2,you've been staring at me for a while now. Why?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_3,Because you're so cute.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_4,You have rice on your face.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_5,...
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_6,"I get that from customers all the time, so I thought I wouldn't feel anything."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_7,"But it feels great to hear it from you, Master."
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_8,Huh?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_9,When did that get there? Must have been when I was making omurice.
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_10,Where is it? Can you get it for me?
d_counseling_anchor_innocentmaid_20_11,Anchor and I have a pleasant counseling session.
d_counseling_bready_01_title,Advising Bready: 01
d_counseling_bready_01_1,"Bonne Bouche, if the food you're served isn't to your liking,"
d_counseling_bready_01_2,what would you do?
d_counseling_bready_01_3,"I would eat it all, down to the last morsel, and do it with a smile on my face."
d_counseling_bready_01_4,I would say something to the chef.
d_counseling_bready_01_5,I'd do that because I could tell someone had put their heart and soul into making it for me.
d_counseling_bready_01_6,"Wow, that's totally you, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_01_7,You really know how to show appreciation to whoever prepared the meal.
d_counseling_bready_01_8,...?
d_counseling_bready_01_9,Would you really do that?
d_counseling_bready_01_10,"You're kidding, right?"
d_counseling_bready_01_11,"Yeah, I'm just messing around."
d_counseling_bready_01_12,Bready and I imagine situations where we receive food that isn't to our liking.
d_counseling_bready_02_title,Advising Bready: 02
d_counseling_bready_02_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_bready_02_2,Bready stares intently at my finger.
d_counseling_bready_02_3,... Is there something wrong?
d_counseling_bready_02_4,I feel like trying a different flavor today.
d_counseling_bready_02_5,What should I put on your finger?
d_counseling_bready_02_6,How about chocolate?
d_counseling_bready_02_7,Could we maybe skip putting something on my fingers today?
d_counseling_bready_02_8,"Hmm... chocolate sounds nice, but I feel like I had that not too long ago."
d_counseling_bready_02_9,Any other ideas?
d_counseling_bready_02_10,"Actually, now that I think about it, it has been a while since I had you ""raw""."
d_counseling_bready_02_11,"All right then, time to dig in!"
d_counseling_bready_02_12,Bready and I think about what else we can potentially put on my fingers during future visits.
d_counseling_bready_03_title,Advising Bready: 03
d_counseling_bready_03_1,...
d_counseling_bready_03_2,... Are you waiting for something?
d_counseling_bready_03_3,Huh? What's that?
d_counseling_bready_03_4,"Oh, well... are you not going to take a shower?"
d_counseling_bready_03_5,"Not that I really mind, if I'm being honest."
d_counseling_bready_03_6,It may take me a while to wash up properly. Is that okay?
d_counseling_bready_03_7,Would just washing my hands be fine?
d_counseling_bready_03_8,That'd be perfectly all right.
d_counseling_bready_03_9,I feel like indulging myself today.
d_counseling_bready_03_10,"I'm sorry, but"
d_counseling_bready_03_11,I feel like savoring every last lick today.
d_counseling_bready_03_12,I'd prefer it if you wash up thoroughly.
d_counseling_bready_03_13,"After our session, I once again act as Bready's meal."
d_counseling_bready_04_title,Advising Bready: 04
d_counseling_bready_04_1,"Bonne Bouche, what do you think about instant food?"
d_counseling_bready_04_2,"Like cup noodles, for example."
d_counseling_bready_04_3,"I find them a bit inadequate, because they lack heart."
d_counseling_bready_04_4,They're one of humanity's greatest inventions.
d_counseling_bready_04_5,I feel the same.
d_counseling_bready_04_6,Instant foods all tend to taste pretty similar.
d_counseling_bready_04_7,That's why I don't particularly like them.
d_counseling_bready_04_8,I never knew that's how you felt...
d_counseling_bready_04_9,I do suppose they offer the best flavor possible in such a short span of time.
d_counseling_bready_04_10,They may well be a good choice for someone as busy as yourself.
d_counseling_bready_04_11,Bready and I talk more about instant foods.
d_counseling_bready_05_title,Advising Bready: 05
d_counseling_bready_05_1,"Bonne Bouche, what's your favorite flavor profile?"
d_counseling_bready_05_2,"There's sweet, sour, bitter, and so on."
d_counseling_bready_05_3,"Above all else, sincerity."
d_counseling_bready_05_4,Spiciness.
d_counseling_bready_05_5,Sincerity?
d_counseling_bready_05_6,So you value the effort put into the dish rather than the taste itself?
d_counseling_bready_05_7,"That's so like you, Bonne Bouche. What a unique perspective."
d_counseling_bready_05_8,Really?
d_counseling_bready_05_9,Spiciness is closer to a sensation than a concrete flavor.
d_counseling_bready_05_10,I'm surprised that you perceive it as such. Such a fresh perspective!
d_counseling_bready_05_11,Bready and I discuss our preferred tastes.
d_counseling_bready_06_title,Advising Bready: 06
d_counseling_bready_06_1,Do you like that
d_counseling_bready_06_2,I call you Bonne Bouche?
d_counseling_bready_06_3,I've been wondering whether it makes you uncomfortable.
d_counseling_bready_06_4,Not at all. It's a special nickname that you invented just for me.
d_counseling_bready_06_5,There are occasions where I think it's a bit too... cutesy.
d_counseling_bready_06_6,I like it very much.
d_counseling_bready_06_7,!!
d_counseling_bready_06_8,"You really are like no one else I've met, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_06_9,"The more I get to know you, the more fascinating you become."
d_counseling_bready_06_10,"Hmm, I see."
d_counseling_bready_06_11,"Well, if it ever makes you feel too uncomfortable, please do let me know."
d_counseling_bready_06_12,I don't ever want you to feel troubled because of me.
d_counseling_bready_06_13,Bready and I further discuss what she calls me.
d_counseling_bready_07_title,Advising Bready: 07
d_counseling_bready_07_1,"Ugh. Sometimes, even at night, I get a craving for you, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_07_2,Like how some crave a late-night snack.
d_counseling_bready_07_3,What should I do when that happens?
d_counseling_bready_07_4,"I'd say that you can come over anytime, but I really do need my sleep..."
d_counseling_bready_07_5,"If I'm still awake, you can come over."
d_counseling_bready_07_6,"Oh, okay. If my coming over would disturb your sleep routine, then never mind."
d_counseling_bready_07_7,I can restrain myself...
d_counseling_bready_07_8,I think... *slurp*...
d_counseling_bready_07_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_bready_07_10,"You're very kind, but I don't want to bother you while you're resting. I'll only reach out if it's really urgent."
d_counseling_bready_07_11,Bready and I talk about what to do when late-night cravings come calling.
d_counseling_bready_08_title,Advising Bready: 08
d_counseling_bready_08_1,"I'm really sorry, Bonne Bouche,"
d_counseling_bready_08_2,but is it okay if I eat something first before our session?
d_counseling_bready_08_3,"Crust is too busy today to make me a meal, so I'll get a bit hungry during the day."
d_counseling_bready_08_4,I'm feeling somewhat peckish myself. Why don't we eat together?
d_counseling_bready_08_5,"No, let's finish the session first."
d_counseling_bready_08_6,"Thanks, Bonne Bouche. You're the best."
d_counseling_bready_08_7,But you didn't bring any food...
d_counseling_bready_08_8,"Hehe, would you look at that? Silly me, I forgot to pack myself anything."
d_counseling_bready_08_9,"... You wouldn't mind if I borrowed one of your fingers real quick, would you?"
d_counseling_bready_08_10,That should be enough to tide me over.
d_counseling_bready_08_11,*Sigh*... I see you're a real stickler for the rules.
d_counseling_bready_08_12,"Fine, I suppose it can't be helped."
d_counseling_bready_08_13,...
d_counseling_bready_08_14,*Slurp*...
d_counseling_bready_08_15,"Sorry, but while we're talking, could I borrow just one finger...?"
d_counseling_bready_08_16,"We continue the session while Bready has her ""meal""."
d_counseling_bready_09_title,Advising Bready: 09
d_counseling_bready_09_1,"Bonne Bouche, what do you think is the most important aspect of the dining experience?"
d_counseling_bready_09_2,"The appearance of the food, or the taste?"
d_counseling_bready_09_3,"It's like they say: food that looks good, also tastes good."
d_counseling_bready_09_4,"For me, the best thing is the act of eating itself."
d_counseling_bready_09_5,"I suppose there may be something to that,"
d_counseling_bready_09_6,"but sometimes, sumptuous-looking food can end up tasting awful."
d_counseling_bready_09_7,"When that happens, you can tell no heart was put into the making of it, and that ruins the entire experience."
d_counseling_bready_09_8,"Of course, if the meal is like you, appetizing both visually and in terms of flavor, that's perfection."
d_counseling_bready_09_9,You have the mindset of a true gourmet.
d_counseling_bready_09_10,"They say you should taste food once with your eyes, once with your nose, and once again with your mouth."
d_counseling_bready_09_11,All your senses come together to create the full dining experience.
d_counseling_bready_09_12,Bready and I talk about what we value when eating food.
d_counseling_bready_10_title,Advising Bready: 10
d_counseling_bready_10_1,"I'm very grateful to Crust for everything she's done, so I want to invite her out for a meal."
d_counseling_bready_10_2,"But as you know, I'm no expert in the kitchen."
d_counseling_bready_10_3,I wonder if there's anyone who could lend me a hand?
d_counseling_bready_10_4,I'll help you.
d_counseling_bready_10_5,What about Tia?
d_counseling_bready_10_6,"I definitely have faith in your abilities, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_10_7,"Crust does call you Mr. Gourmand, after all."
d_counseling_bready_10_8,I'm looking forward to your help!
d_counseling_bready_10_9,Isn't Tia the one who has a sweet tooth?
d_counseling_bready_10_10,I think Crust prefers a more well-balanced flavor profile.
d_counseling_bready_10_11,Do you know anyone else who might be able to help me?
d_counseling_bready_10_12,I ponder who might be able to assist Bready.
d_counseling_bready_11_title,Advising Bready: 11
d_counseling_bready_11_1,"I've eaten countless dishes in my day, but Crust's cooking stands entirely on its own."
d_counseling_bready_11_2,What about it makes it so different?
d_counseling_bready_11_3,She uses expensive ingredients.
d_counseling_bready_11_4,"She cooks from the heart, a heart which is devoted solely to you."
d_counseling_bready_11_5,"If it were just the ingredients, I would've picked up on it."
d_counseling_bready_11_6,"There must be some other factor at play, something that only Crust is capable of."
d_counseling_bready_11_7,!!
d_counseling_bready_11_8,That sounds about right.
d_counseling_bready_11_9,"When I'm eating Crust's cooking, I can sense her desire for me to be happy."
d_counseling_bready_11_10,Bready and I talk more about Crust's cooking.
d_counseling_bready_12_title,Advising Bready: 12
d_counseling_bready_12_1,"When you're at a restaurant, what do you place the most emphasis on?"
d_counseling_bready_12_2,The taste of the food? The hygiene? The service?
d_counseling_bready_12_3,I think hygiene is the most important.
d_counseling_bready_12_4,Good-tasting food is all that matters.
d_counseling_bready_12_5,I agree.
d_counseling_bready_12_6,"If an establishment is filthy, you might lose your appetite before even tasting the food."
d_counseling_bready_12_7,I feel the basics always have to be in place before you can assess the food itself.
d_counseling_bready_12_8,Does that mean you don't mind unclean or unfriendly restaurants?
d_counseling_bready_12_9,"... Now that I think about it, that's not quite right."
d_counseling_bready_12_10,You see?
d_counseling_bready_12_11,"When you're evaluating something, there are often multiple factors at play, so take your time and think it over."
d_counseling_bready_12_12,Bready and I talk about what's most important in a restaurant.
d_counseling_bready_13_title,Advising Bready: 13
d_counseling_bready_13_1,"Oh, a hair."
d_counseling_bready_13_2,Bready picks up a stray strand of hair from the floor.
d_counseling_bready_13_3,*Lick*
d_counseling_bready_13_4,Hmm... this person stopped by the Commander's Room yesterday.
d_counseling_bready_13_5,It's probably mine.
d_counseling_bready_13_6,Could it be Rapi's?
d_counseling_bready_13_7,"No, the taste is completely different."
d_counseling_bready_13_8,"You think I wouldn't recognize your flavor, Bonne Bouche?"
d_counseling_bready_13_9,"Plus, it's clearly much longer than your own hair."
d_counseling_bready_13_10,Hmm.
d_counseling_bready_13_11,She trusts you completely. You two have a remarkably strong bond.
d_counseling_bready_13_12,"... You have truly incredible teammates, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_13_13,"After some further investigation, we determine whose hair was on the floor."
d_counseling_bready_14_title,Advising Bready: 14
d_counseling_bready_14_1,Let's see...
d_counseling_bready_14_2,What part should I taste today?
d_counseling_bready_14_3,Any recommendations?
d_counseling_bready_14_4,My neck.
d_counseling_bready_14_5,My fingers.
d_counseling_bready_14_6,"Oh, good idea!"
d_counseling_bready_14_7,*Nom*
d_counseling_bready_14_8,...!
d_counseling_bready_14_9,"Hmm... the fingers do always hit the spot,"
d_counseling_bready_14_10,but I feel like trying something different today.
d_counseling_bready_14_11,I give Bready a recommendation for where she should dine today.
d_counseling_bready_15_title,Advising Bready: 15
d_counseling_bready_15_1,What do you think about Emma's cooking?
d_counseling_bready_15_2,"Her cooking is... too avant-garde for human tastes, perhaps."
d_counseling_bready_15_3,Her cooking is... remarkable. In more ways than one.
d_counseling_bready_15_4,"... That would explain the flavor, perhaps."
d_counseling_bready_15_5,I think I may agree with you.
d_counseling_bready_15_6,I've never seen Crust react like that to someone else's cooking.
d_counseling_bready_15_7,So you felt that way as well?
d_counseling_bready_15_8,"There were a few things that surprised me about Emma's cooking, too."
d_counseling_bready_15_9,Especially the way it was clearly brimming with a sense of care for others.
d_counseling_bready_15_10,"... However, her understanding of taste does seem a bit lacking."
d_counseling_bready_15_11,Bready and I talk about Emma's cooking.
d_counseling_bready_16_title,Advising Bready: 16
d_counseling_bready_16_1,"Bonne Bouche, tasting you has got me wondering:"
d_counseling_bready_16_2,What's the most delicious meal you've ever had?
d_counseling_bready_16_3,Some instant noodles after returning from a mission.
d_counseling_bready_16_4,The midnight snack I had last night.
d_counseling_bready_16_5,"Oh, that's an unexpected answer."
d_counseling_bready_16_6,"I suppose, depending on the situation, even instant food can feel like a gourmet feast."
d_counseling_bready_16_7,"Your answers are always so unique, Bonne Bouche. I get such a kick out of them."
d_counseling_bready_16_8,"Hmm, I had a feeling that was the case."
d_counseling_bready_16_9,Why?
d_counseling_bready_16_10,It's just that your face is a little... puffier than usual.
d_counseling_bready_16_11,Bready and I talk about the most delicious meals we've ever had.
d_counseling_bready_17_title,Advising Bready: 17
d_counseling_bready_17_1,"Of humanity's three major desires, I think food is the most important."
d_counseling_bready_17_2,Especially when you satisfy that desire with delicious food.
d_counseling_bready_17_3,"What about you, Bonne Bouche? Which one do you think is the most important?"
d_counseling_bready_17_4,Sleep.
d_counseling_bready_17_5,Food.
d_counseling_bready_17_6,I can almost feel years being knocked off my life when I'm tired.
d_counseling_bready_17_7,"Mmm, I have seen some formidable dark circles under your eyes before."
d_counseling_bready_17_8,I suppose proper sleep should come before a meal.
d_counseling_bready_17_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_bready_17_10,So we agree.
d_counseling_bready_17_11,It's hard to resist hunger.
d_counseling_bready_17_12,"Haha, glad to see you understand the joy of eating."
d_counseling_bready_17_13,Bready and I talk about which desire we consider the most important.
d_counseling_bready_18_title,Advising Bready: 18
d_counseling_bready_18_1,Have you seen the candy that was on this plate?
d_counseling_bready_18_2,"I'm positive that I left it here yesterday, but now it's gone."
d_counseling_bready_18_3,"Sorry, but it looked like it'd been there for a while, so I threw it out before dust started gathering on it."
d_counseling_bready_18_4,Maybe that's what Anis and Neon were fighting over yesterday...
d_counseling_bready_18_5,"Whew, what a relief."
d_counseling_bready_18_6,I was worried someone might've eaten it.
d_counseling_bready_18_7,Was it something inedible?
d_counseling_bready_18_8,Not really.
d_counseling_bready_18_9,I'd already eaten some of it.
d_counseling_bready_18_10,...!
d_counseling_bready_18_11,"So, who ended up eating it?"
d_counseling_bready_18_12,I think Anis did. Why?
d_counseling_bready_18_13,I was eating that!
d_counseling_bready_18_14,"I obviously didn't mean to, but I feel kinda bad having Anis eat my leftovers..."
d_counseling_bready_18_15,Bready and I discuss the missing candy.
d_counseling_bready_19_title,Advising Bready: 19
d_counseling_bready_19_1,I'm craving something with some zing to it.
d_counseling_bready_19_2,Do you have any recommendations?
d_counseling_bready_19_3,Cosmo Burger in the Ark Square.
d_counseling_bready_19_4,Coffee from the Outpost Cafe.
d_counseling_bready_19_5,You mean the burger our boss advertised?
d_counseling_bready_19_6,"If we're talking strictly about taste, it's not too bad,"
d_counseling_bready_19_7,but fast food doesn't excite me all that much.
d_counseling_bready_19_8,Anything else?
d_counseling_bready_19_9,"Ah, right. I've heard about that."
d_counseling_bready_19_10,People say the baristas take great pride in their work.
d_counseling_bready_19_11,"I'm not sure if I'd call them baristas, but they definitely stand by their product."
d_counseling_bready_19_12,"All right, I'll have to check it out later. Thanks for the recommendation, Bonne Bouche."
d_counseling_bready_19_13,I give Bready some recommendations for places to find strong flavors.
d_counseling_bready_20_title,Advising Bready: 20
d_counseling_bready_20_1,"I've got plans during the day tomorrow, so I'll only be free in the morning or at night."
d_counseling_bready_20_2,Which time would work better for you?
d_counseling_bready_20_3,Morning.
d_counseling_bready_20_4,Night.
d_counseling_bready_20_5,Excellent.
d_counseling_bready_20_6,I can taste you first thing in the morning and start my day feeling refreshed.
d_counseling_bready_20_7,"In that case, I'll come back in the morning!"
d_counseling_bready_20_8,You visiting me at night might be a bit... problematic.
d_counseling_bready_20_9,Hm? What do you mean?
d_counseling_bready_20_10,Do you mean you'll be tired?
d_counseling_bready_20_11,"... Sure, let's go with that."
d_counseling_bready_20_12,Bready and I make plans for when to meet tomorrow.
d_counseling_crust_01_title,Advising Crust: 01
d_counseling_crust_01_1,"How do you manage your food intake when you're busy, Mr. Gourmand?"
d_counseling_crust_01_2,"You're not skipping meals, are you?"
d_counseling_crust_01_3,"No matter how busy I am, I always try to set aside time to eat."
d_counseling_crust_01_4,"There are times when I'm simply too busy, and don't have time to eat."
d_counseling_crust_01_5,"Phew, that's a relief."
d_counseling_crust_01_6,"Sometimes you eat in such a hurry when you're here, I started to get worried."
d_counseling_crust_01_7,That's only because your cooking is so fantastic.
d_counseling_crust_01_8,R-really?
d_counseling_crust_01_9,"Hehe, that makes me so happy!  Next time you visit, I'll give you a bigger serving."
d_counseling_crust_01_10,Mr. Gourmand!
d_counseling_crust_01_11,"It doesn't matter how busy you get, you must never skip meals!"
d_counseling_crust_01_12,"Let me know when you're swamped, and I'll make sure that you're taken care of, okay?"
d_counseling_crust_01_13,Crust and I have a conversation about having meals when I'm busy.
d_counseling_crust_02_title,Advising Crust: 02
d_counseling_crust_02_1,Ooey gooey goodness.
d_counseling_crust_02_2,Make this lunchbox delicious!
d_counseling_crust_02_3,Why are you of all people saying that spell?
d_counseling_crust_02_4,"Ooey gooey goodness, make this lunchbox delicious!"
d_counseling_crust_02_5,"Oh, Mr. Gourmand!"
d_counseling_crust_02_6,I wanted to imbue your lunch for today with some extra joy.
d_counseling_crust_02_7,"Hehe, sorry if it looked a bit strange."
d_counseling_crust_02_8,Mr. Gourmand! Don't butt in on the spell!
d_counseling_crust_02_9,I wanted to imbue this food with joy...
d_counseling_crust_02_10,"Since my happiness went into it too, doesn't that mean it's doubled?"
d_counseling_crust_02_11,!!
d_counseling_crust_02_12,"Hehe, you always manage to surprise me, Mr. Gourmand."
d_counseling_crust_02_13,"Well then, enjoy this special lunch filled with double the happiness!"
d_counseling_crust_02_14,"I eat my lunch, which has been blessed with Crust's magical spell."

d_counseling_crust_03_1,"I discovered some interesting ingredients recently, and I've been looking into them."
d_counseling_crust_03_2,"Unfortunately, my shooting schedule fell behind because of all the time I dedicated to research, and now I'm playing catch-up."
d_counseling_crust_03_3,There's just not enough time in the day!
d_counseling_crust_03_4,Now I know what it's like to have to juggle two jobs at once...
d_counseling_crust_03_5,But doesn't it feel rewarding in a way?
d_counseling_crust_03_6,Now you know how I feel.
d_counseling_crust_03_7,It's precisely that feeling which motivates me to work as hard as I do.
d_counseling_crust_03_8,"Now that I think about it, you're right."
d_counseling_crust_03_9,It does feel rewarding.
d_counseling_crust_03_10,"Whenever I research new ingredients and feature them on the show, a lot of people get to try it and feel happy."
d_counseling_crust_03_11,"Hehe, just thinking about that is giving me a second wind! Thank you, Mr. Gourmand."
d_counseling_crust_03_12,Are you in the same situation too?
d_counseling_crust_03_13,I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm liable to collapse soon.
d_counseling_crust_03_14,"Well... let's hang in there, Mr. Gourmand."

d_counseling_crust_04_1,Mr. Gourmand.
d_counseling_crust_04_2,"Do you prefer seafood, or red meat?"
d_counseling_crust_04_3,Neither.
d_counseling_crust_04_4,"Recently, I've been leaning more towards seafood."
d_counseling_crust_04_5,Huh?!
d_counseling_crust_04_6,But most of the dishes I've been making for you were either seafood or red meat...
d_counseling_crust_04_7,Have you been forcing yourself to eat my cooking?
d_counseling_crust_04_8,"I say neither, because I like both equally."
d_counseling_crust_04_9,...
d_counseling_crust_04_10,"You certainly do have a way of keeping me on my toes, Mr. Gourmand."
d_counseling_crust_04_11,"Wow, really?"
d_counseling_crust_04_12,"Then, after our session, would you like to come to my kitchen?"
d_counseling_crust_04_13,I've been working on a new seafood course.
d_counseling_crust_04_14,"Ooh, would that be okay?"
d_counseling_crust_04_15,"Of course! Hehe, I hope you like it."

d_counseling_crust_05_2,"""I followed her recipe to a T, and it tasted awful. Does she even taste her own food?"""
d_counseling_crust_05_3,What is this?
d_counseling_crust_05_4,Hate comments from the Crunchy Cooking Class forum.
d_counseling_crust_05_5,What's the best way to handle something like this?
d_counseling_crust_05_6,You could invite them onto the show.
d_counseling_crust_05_7,What about just blocking their account?
d_counseling_crust_05_8,"If they taste your food, they'll change their mind."
d_counseling_crust_05_9,!!
d_counseling_crust_05_10,Okay!
d_counseling_crust_05_11,I... I can do that!
d_counseling_crust_05_12,"I'll show those haters that I'm a real chef, one even they have to acknowledge!"
d_counseling_crust_05_13,"I considered that, but then they'd just set up another account,"
d_counseling_crust_05_14,and keep posting more hateful comments.
d_counseling_crust_05_15,There must be another solution...
d_counseling_crust_05_16,Crust and I talk about how to handle hate comments online.

d_counseling_crust_06_5,"This is a new dish I've been developing, so I'm dying to know what you think. Oh man... I'm so nervous...!"
d_counseling_crust_06_6,It's pretty good.
d_counseling_crust_06_7,I can't believe you just made me eat that.
d_counseling_crust_06_8,Er... could you perhaps be more specific?
d_counseling_crust_06_9,"If you gave more detailed feedback, it'd be a big help."
d_counseling_crust_06_10,Huh? Does it not taste good?
d_counseling_crust_06_11,"It tastes so wonderful, that I'll never be happy eating anything else."
d_counseling_crust_06_12,Oh!
d_counseling_crust_06_13,Whew... thank goodness. I was worried you'd have bad things to say about it.
d_counseling_crust_06_14,I worked really hard on this recipe.
d_counseling_crust_06_15,I taste the new dish that Crust developed.

d_counseling_crust_07_3,What's wrong?
d_counseling_crust_07_4,I signed up for the cooking competition hosted by Tetra.
d_counseling_crust_07_5,What should I do? I'm freaking out!
d_counseling_crust_07_6,Just imagine that you're cooking for Bready.
d_counseling_crust_07_7,A little nervousness could actually help you perform better.
d_counseling_crust_07_8,!!
d_counseling_crust_07_9,You... You mean I should just cook like I usually do? And enjoy myself?
d_counseling_crust_07_10,"You're right, Mr. Gourmand! I feel much more confident now. Thank you!"
d_counseling_crust_07_11,R-really? You think so?
d_counseling_crust_07_12,"I won't mess up because my hands are trembling too much or anything, will I?"
d_counseling_crust_07_13,*Tremble tremble*
d_counseling_crust_07_14,"Crust, calm down."
d_counseling_crust_07_15,I talk to Crust about what to do when feeling nervous.

d_counseling_crust_08_1,I sometimes envy Bready
d_counseling_crust_08_2,when she experiences the flavor of something in its purest form.
d_counseling_crust_08_3,The look on her face is one of sheer bliss. What do I need to do to feel that good?
d_counseling_crust_08_4,"If you're curious, would you like another taste?"
d_counseling_crust_08_5,There are plenty of times when you have a similar expression.
d_counseling_crust_08_6,You mean your fingers? But I couldn't taste anything last time.
d_counseling_crust_08_7,"I suppose I'll give it another try, though."
d_counseling_crust_08_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_crust_08_9,Huh? When?
d_counseling_crust_08_10,Think about how you feel when you're cooking.
d_counseling_crust_08_11,When I'm cooking...
d_counseling_crust_08_12,You're right!
d_counseling_crust_08_13,"Hehe, come to think of it, I'm always the happiest when I'm cooking for someone."
d_counseling_crust_08_14,Crust and I have a conversation about the joyful expressions she and Bready make.

d_counseling_crust_09_1,Is there anything you dislike about the military rations?
d_counseling_crust_09_2,"The taste isn't anything to write home about, for one."
d_counseling_crust_09_3,Not really. No complaints.
d_counseling_crust_09_4,"I think it's because they're something that has to be produced in mass quantities at a low cost, and also have a long shelf life."
d_counseling_crust_09_5,Well...
d_counseling_crust_09_6,"At some point, I'll look into making military rations that everyone can enjoy."
d_counseling_crust_09_7,I appreciate your honesty.
d_counseling_crust_09_8,Oh? Really?
d_counseling_crust_09_9,Interesting... I've never met someone who didn't have any complaints whatsoever.
d_counseling_crust_09_10,"Different strokes for different folks, I suppose!"

d_counseling_crust_10_5,"Oh my gosh, it's so glaringly obvious! Why didn't anyone tell me?!"
d_counseling_crust_10_6,"You don't think I looked too silly, do you?"
d_counseling_crust_10_7,You looked cute. It's fine.
d_counseling_crust_10_8,You looked like a chef who was working hard to finish a dish.
d_counseling_crust_10_9,You say that...
d_counseling_crust_10_10,But all I hear is that I looked silly!
d_counseling_crust_10_11,Aw man...
d_counseling_crust_10_12,Really?
d_counseling_crust_10_13,I did work awfully hard on the cake for that episode.

d_counseling_crust_11_2,What do you think the children would like?
d_counseling_crust_11_3,Your special full-course meal.
d_counseling_crust_11_4,You can't go wrong with chicken.
d_counseling_crust_11_5,"If the children get a chance to taste your multi-course meal, it'll be an experience they'll never forget."
d_counseling_crust_11_6,"Ooh, you may be right!"
d_counseling_crust_11_7,I'd love for the children to taste my food and be happy.
d_counseling_crust_11_8,"All right, I'm confident that's the right route to go now. Thanks, Mr. Gourmand."
d_counseling_crust_11_9,"Chicken is delicious, sure."
d_counseling_crust_11_10,But I want to make them something they've never tried before.
d_counseling_crust_11_11,Surely I can fix them up something more interesting than that.
d_counseling_crust_11_12,Crust and I choose a menu for the children at the orphanage.

d_counseling_crust_12_6,Enjoy!
d_counseling_crust_12_7,...
d_counseling_crust_12_8,"You're eating awfully slowly, Mr. Gourmand. Are you not hungry?"
d_counseling_crust_12_9,"To be honest, I ate just before you got here..."
d_counseling_crust_12_10,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_crust_12_11,"You don't have to force yourself to eat, you know."
d_counseling_crust_12_12,You should have told me! I'd have prepared just the dessert for you instead.
d_counseling_crust_12_13,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_crust_12_14,"In that case, we can leave the main entrée for later, and you can try the dessert."
d_counseling_crust_12_15,"I appreciate it, Crust."
d_counseling_crust_12_16,"Hehe, no, I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Gourmand."

d_counseling_crust_13_1,I have a hypothetical question for you:
d_counseling_crust_13_2,"Let's say that while you're cooking, you run out of sugar. How would you adapt?"
d_counseling_crust_13_3,I'd look for a substitute ingredient.
d_counseling_crust_13_4,"I'm not a big fan of sweet things, so I'd just leave it out."
d_counseling_crust_13_5,"Hehe, yes, that's the proper answer."
d_counseling_crust_13_6,There's no reason to skip an ingredient when you can substitute it for something similar.
d_counseling_crust_13_7,"Sure, the taste might be a little different, but that's okay."
d_counseling_crust_13_8,What? But that would completely alter the taste of the dish.
d_counseling_crust_13_9,Wouldn't it be better to at least try and use a similar ingredient?
d_counseling_crust_13_10,Crust and I discuss more hypothetical culinary scenarios.

d_counseling_crust_14_4,Cooking experience.
d_counseling_crust_14_5,The subtle details.
d_counseling_crust_14_6,"Experience is important, to be sure, and it certainly can make a difference."
d_counseling_crust_14_7,"However, I've also seen many remarkably skilled chefs who don't have extensive experience."
d_counseling_crust_14_8,There must be another factor at play.
d_counseling_crust_14_9,"I knew you'd be able to understand, Mr. Gourmand!"
d_counseling_crust_14_10,"The deeper you dive into cooking, the more levels there are to it."
d_counseling_crust_14_11,"Take molecular gastronomy for example, where you study the chemical composition of ingredients and how they react with other components."

d_counseling_crust_15_8,"That's a wonderful recommendation. Thanks, Mr. Gourmand!"

d_counseling_crust_16_6,"but before preparing food that will go into someone's mouth, isn't there something else you should do first?"
d_counseling_crust_16_7,Think about it again.
d_counseling_crust_16_8,That's correct!
d_counseling_crust_16_9,The most important thing in any kitchen is proper hygiene.

d_counseling_arcana_05_6,"Ugh. You really don't pay attention to me, do you?"
d_counseling_arcana_05_7,How disappointing...
d_counseling_arcana_05_8,Why that one?
d_counseling_arcana_05_9,Because it's your favorite.
d_counseling_arcana_05_10,"Hehe, is that so?"
d_counseling_arcana_05_11,"I have to admit, that wasn't really the answer I was hoping for."
d_counseling_arcana_05_12,Arcana teaches me more about tarot.

d_counseling_arcana_06_1,*Yawn*
d_counseling_arcana_06_2,"Phew, sorry. I promise it's not boring talking to you, but—*yawn*..."
d_counseling_arcana_06_3,"If you're sleepy, would you like to take a nap?"
d_counseling_arcana_06_4,Together?
d_counseling_arcana_06_5,Yeah. I'm kinda sleepy too.
d_counseling_arcana_06_6,That's not what I meant.
d_counseling_arcana_06_7,!!
d_counseling_arcana_06_8,I rest my head in Arcana's lap.
d_counseling_arcana_06_9,"You do realize sleep is the last thing on my mind now, don't you?"
d_counseling_arcana_06_10,Why not? Are you shy?
d_counseling_arcana_06_11,It's just a nap. Perfectly innocent. No big deal.
d_counseling_arcana_06_12,Arcana scooches over and rests her head on my shoulder.
d_counseling_arcana_06_13,... Sleep well.
d_counseling_arcana_06_14,I spend a relaxing afternoon with Arcana.

d_counseling_arcana_07_3,"Without waiting for a response from me, Arcana pulls out her phone and starts striking different poses."
d_counseling_arcana_07_4,Adopt a playful pose similar to Arcana's.
d_counseling_arcana_07_5,Wrap your arm around Arcana's waist and pull her closer to you.
d_counseling_arcana_07_6,"Ha, what's this? You copying me?"
d_counseling_arcana_07_7,"All right, how about we try this?"
d_counseling_arcana_07_8,Oh!
d_counseling_arcana_07_9,Well... I suppose this is a bit more like a photo a couple would take together.
d_counseling_arcana_07_10,I take several pictures with Arcana.

d_counseling_arcana_08_4,Sure.
d_counseling_arcana_08_5,I'm a bit busy this weekend.
d_counseling_arcana_08_6,You better dress up nice!

d_counseling_arcana_08_11,Whoa!

d_counseling_arcana_09_2,"My whole body feels a little achy, and I've got a slight headache."
d_counseling_arcana_09_3,I was wondering if I could rest here for a bit?
d_counseling_arcana_09_4,"Just to rest, I mean! No funny business. Honestly."
d_counseling_arcana_09_5,Don't worry. We can talk later.
d_counseling_arcana_09_6,I'm taking you to the hospital.
d_counseling_arcana_09_7,Thanks.
d_counseling_arcana_09_8,But... hospitals kinda freak me out.
d_counseling_arcana_09_9,"All those machines and tests... it's all a bit traumatic, you know?"
d_counseling_arcana_09_10,I'll be fine. I just need to rest for a moment.
d_counseling_arcana_09_11,Arcana leans against me as if she has no strength left.
d_counseling_arcana_09_12,"You're not going anywhere, are you?"
d_counseling_arcana_09_13,Where else would I go?
d_counseling_arcana_09_14,... Okay.

d_counseling_arcana_10_4,Or rather...
d_counseling_arcana_10_5,what kind of outfit would you like me to wear?
d_counseling_arcana_10_6,"You'd look great in anything, Arcana."
d_counseling_arcana_10_7,"Whatever suits you, I guess."
d_counseling_arcana_10_8,That's not really the answer I was looking for.
d_counseling_arcana_10_9,"Don't you think you're laying it on a bit thick, {AccountData.NickName}?"
d_counseling_arcana_10_10,I mean it.
d_counseling_arcana_10_11,... That's precisely the problem.
d_counseling_arcana_10_12,Yeah?
d_counseling_arcana_10_13,Then I'll just show up in a stretched-out T-shirt and baggy sweatpants.
d_counseling_arcana_10_14,"After all, I do look good in everything."
d_counseling_arcana_10_15,I share my thoughts with Arcana regarding what to wear on a date.

d_counseling_arcana_11_3,...
d_counseling_arcana_11_4,Do you think...
d_counseling_arcana_11_5,what I'm doing has any meaning?
d_counseling_arcana_11_6,"At the very least, it means something to me."
d_counseling_arcana_11_7,"You've done a wonderful job, and continue to do so."
d_counseling_arcana_11_8,... Yeah.
d_counseling_arcana_11_9,"Now that I think about it, that's reason enough for me."
d_counseling_arcana_11_10,I was overthinking things for no reason.
d_counseling_arcana_11_11,You're right.
d_counseling_arcana_11_12,I think meeting you has softened me.
d_counseling_arcana_11_13,Why's that?
d_counseling_arcana_11_14,Hmm...
d_counseling_arcana_11_15,Maybe because now I have a place to run to.
d_counseling_arcana_11_16,I talk with Arcana about purpose and meaning.

d_counseling_arcana_12_1,"Ugh, I don't wanna work."

d_counseling_arcana_12_3,What happened to your sense of purpose?
d_counseling_arcana_12_4,"No no, I'm not talking about the Forbidden Library."
d_counseling_arcana_12_5,"It's just that now, on top of that, I've also got to take care of the library in the Outpost."
d_counseling_arcana_12_6,Think of it as an excuse to come and see me.
d_counseling_arcana_12_7,You can do this. I believe in you.
d_counseling_arcana_12_8,You really think that's reason enough to motivate me?
d_counseling_arcana_12_9,...
d_counseling_arcana_12_10,"Hey, you're right! Work has been super rewarding and fun today!"
d_counseling_arcana_12_11,I need more than just words to encourage me.
d_counseling_arcana_12_12,"Try and visit me a little more often,"
d_counseling_arcana_12_13,and maybe I'll feel a little more... rewarded.
d_counseling_arcana_12_14,I talk with Arcana about the meaning of work.
d_counseling_arcana_13_title,Advising Arcana: 13
d_counseling_arcana_13_1,I don't really have anything specific to talk about today.
d_counseling_arcana_13_2,Mind if we just chit-chat?
d_counseling_arcana_13_3,Phantom was saying something about an operation involving the library...
d_counseling_arcana_13_4,What were you up to yesterday?
d_counseling_arcana_13_5,Huh?!
d_counseling_arcana_13_6,Wh-why would she tell you that?!
d_counseling_arcana_13_7,Yesterday? Let's see.

d_counseling_arcana_14_3,What do you think about marriage?
d_counseling_arcana_14_4,I think it's something that I'd find very fulfilling.
d_counseling_arcana_14_5,"For me, it's a death sentence."
d_counseling_arcana_14_6,Really? Why?
d_counseling_arcana_14_7,Because I get to spend the rest of my life with the one I love.
d_counseling_arcana_14_8,"Wow, I didn't expect you to be so romantic."
d_counseling_arcana_14_9,I suppose you're right. What could be better than that?
d_counseling_arcana_14_10,"Oh my gosh, why would you think that?!"
d_counseling_arcana_14_11,"Because any time a problem comes up, I have to worry about someone else in addition to myself."
d_counseling_arcana_14_12,"Then you face it together, with the person you love!"
d_counseling_arcana_14_13,I share my thoughts on marriage with Arcana.

d_counseling_arcana_15_5,What's gotten into you? You usually play along with this stuff.
d_counseling_arcana_15_6,Let's try again.
d_counseling_arcana_15_7,"For real? Wow, how funny."
d_counseling_arcana_15_8,Perhaps we're destined to meet! In that case...
d_counseling_arcana_15_9,Wanna go play jump rope together?
d_counseling_arcana_15_10,"Uh... most people would say, ""Want to grab some coffee?""."
d_counseling_arcana_15_11,But that's so boring!

d_counseling_arcana_16_10,We're just holding hands. It's not a big deal.
d_counseling_arcana_16_11,"Oh, while we're at it, let me read your palm."

d_counseling_arcana_18_3,I just wanted to contribute in any way I could.
d_counseling_arcana_18_4,Wow. I didn't expect you to be so passionate.
d_counseling_arcana_18_5,No wonder you've made such a name for yourself.
d_counseling_arcana_18_6,A lot of people who accomplish amazing things
d_counseling_arcana_18_7,often don't think of themselves as remarkable.
d_counseling_arcana_18_8,That's precisely what makes them all the more impressive.
d_counseling_arcana_18_9,I tell Arcana more about why I chose my profession.

d_counseling_arcana_19_13,I'm sorry. I didn't think about how that might make you feel.
d_counseling_arcana_19_14,Please forgive me.

d_counseling_arcana_19_16,...
d_counseling_arcana_19_17,The weird thing is... It made me kind of happy that you got mad on my behalf.

d_counseling_mori_01_12,That's what everyone says.

d_counseling_mori_07_4,Try to resolve things using your words.
d_counseling_mori_07_5,You shouldn't waste your energy trying to reason with people who are that ungrateful.
d_counseling_mori_07_6,...!
d_counseling_mori_07_7,That's what I was thinking!
d_counseling_mori_07_8,"All right. If they try and come at me tomorrow, I'll set them straight."
d_counseling_mori_07_9,"Hehe, I'm glad that you understand."
d_counseling_mori_07_10,"I've already tried talking to them several times, but they don't even pretend to listen."
d_counseling_mori_07_11,Those assholes... Just wait until I see them again.
d_counseling_mori_07_12,I talk with Mori about how to handle Nikkes who are looking for a fight.

d_counseling_mori_08_1,What was up with that pit outside?
d_counseling_mori_08_2,"It looked dangerous to leave it as is, so I filled it up."
d_counseling_mori_08_3,"Thanks, I was starting to get worried about it."
d_counseling_mori_08_4,No! Why did you do that?!
d_counseling_mori_08_5,Did... Did you just thank me?
d_counseling_mori_08_6,Ah... Ahem.
d_counseling_mori_08_7,I only did it because I nearly fell inside it. You ought to be more careful.
d_counseling_mori_08_8,Why?
d_counseling_mori_08_9,Was that some kind of hole that you were digging on purpose?
d_counseling_mori_08_10,Just joking.
d_counseling_mori_08_11,"Ugh, are you serious?!"
d_counseling_mori_08_12,Stop messing with me!
d_counseling_mori_08_13,Mori and I have a conversation about the pit in the Outpost.
d_counseling_mori_09_title,Advising Mori: 09
d_counseling_mori_09_1,This place is fascinating.
d_counseling_mori_09_2,It somehow feels both unfamiliar and comforting all at once.
d_counseling_mori_09_3,"It has an earthy smell to it as well, like something subterranean."
d_counseling_mori_09_4,Should we air it out?
d_counseling_mori_09_5,"You can take a nap here if you'd like, since you're so fond of this place."
d_counseling_mori_09_6,"No, that's not what I meant."
d_counseling_mori_09_7,"I was only saying that... I feel safe, that's all."
d_counseling_mori_09_8,Really?
d_counseling_mori_09_9,Would that be okay?
d_counseling_mori_09_10,Sure. I'm going out in a bit because I have something else to do.
d_counseling_mori_09_11,"Okay then, a short nap should be okay..."
d_counseling_mori_09_12,...
d_counseling_mori_09_13,Wh-why do you keep looking at me like that?
d_counseling_mori_09_14,"Ugh, forget it. I'm just going to go back."
d_counseling_mori_09_15,Mori and I converse a little more about the Commander's Room.

d_counseling_mori_10_1,"If you didn't have much time left,"
d_counseling_mori_10_2,how would you spend it?
d_counseling_mori_10_3,"I'm only asking out of curiosity, so you don't have to take it too seriously."
d_counseling_mori_10_4,I would want to spend that time with those close to me.
d_counseling_mori_10_5,I'll keep struggling until my dying breath.
d_counseling_mori_10_6,But... what if you don't have those kinds of people in your life?
d_counseling_mori_10_7,Then... maybe some people you're friendly with?
d_counseling_mori_10_8,... And if you don't have something like that either?
d_counseling_mori_10_9,...!
d_counseling_mori_10_10,I knew it! That's totally the right thing to do.
d_counseling_mori_10_11,"No matter how miserable life gets, no one wants to die having lived a life without meaning."
d_counseling_mori_10_12,Mori and I contemplate how we'd like to spend our final moments.

d_counseling_mori_11_1,"Let's say you bought an appliance and it turned out to be defective, what would you do?"
d_counseling_mori_11_2,I'm sure that must have happened to you before.
d_counseling_mori_11_3,I would return it.
d_counseling_mori_11_4,I would try to fix it so that I could use it.
d_counseling_mori_11_5,...
d_counseling_mori_11_6,You're right.
d_counseling_mori_11_7,"If something is incapable of fulfilling its intended purpose, returning it is probably the sensible thing to do."
d_counseling_mori_11_8,But what if that turns out to be a hassle?
d_counseling_mori_11_9,I'd still do it.
d_counseling_mori_11_10,What if it's beyond repair?
d_counseling_mori_11_11,I'm sure it would end up being useful in some way.
d_counseling_mori_11_12,"... You really are an odd duck, Evaluator. Truly."
d_counseling_mori_11_13,Mori and I share more of our thoughts on defective products.

d_counseling_mori_12_4,Who do they think they are... I'll show them not to look down on me...
d_counseling_mori_12_5,"Mori, who is covered in small cuts and bruises, is brushing herself off."
d_counseling_mori_12_6,Bandage her up.
d_counseling_mori_12_7,Ask her what's wrong.
d_counseling_mori_12_8,What are you doing?
d_counseling_mori_12_9,You look like you got hurt.
d_counseling_mori_12_10,Don't be ridiculous. I'm a Nikke. This means nothing.
d_counseling_mori_12_11,"... Still, thanks for the bandages."
d_counseling_mori_12_12,... You don't need to know.
d_counseling_mori_12_13,"If I told you, you'd get dragged into it too."
d_counseling_mori_12_14,And I'm sure you don't want all that hassle.
d_counseling_mori_12_15,I continue the counseling session with a beaten-up Mori.

d_counseling_mori_13_2,"... They must be up to something, although I don't know what."
d_counseling_mori_13_3,You should be more trusting.
d_counseling_mori_13_4,"Yeah, definitely sounds suspicious."
d_counseling_mori_13_5,They may have nothing but honest intentions.
d_counseling_mori_13_6,"Do you know how many times I've given people the benefit of the doubt, only to be stabbed in the back?"
d_counseling_mori_13_7,I'll just have to wait and see. Gotta keep my neck on a swivel.
d_counseling_mori_13_8,I'm glad you agree.
d_counseling_mori_13_9,I can't afford to trust them and end up being betrayed again.
d_counseling_mori_13_10,Mori and I have a conversation about how to deal with suspicious Nikkes.
d_counseling_mori_14_title,Advising Mori: 14
d_counseling_mori_14_1,I find comfort in being alone.
d_counseling_mori_14_2,"It's better to keep people at arm's length, rather than get close and have them turn on you."
d_counseling_mori_14_3,What if you find someone who you feel you can really trust?
d_counseling_mori_14_4,What about me?
d_counseling_mori_14_5,I don't even know if such a thing exists.
d_counseling_mori_14_6,"If it did, then I wouldn't be living this way."
d_counseling_mori_14_7,You?
d_counseling_mori_14_8,Hm...
d_counseling_mori_14_9,"Of all the people I've met in recent memory, you're the most trustworthy."
d_counseling_mori_14_10,... For now.

d_counseling_mori_15_4,That you're intimidating.
d_counseling_mori_15_5,...!
d_counseling_mori_15_6,Cu... Cute?
d_counseling_mori_15_7,Sure. You can be cute sometimes.
d_counseling_mori_15_8,... I think you need to get your eyes examined.
d_counseling_mori_15_9,"Next time, you're not allowed to say that! I forbid it!"
d_counseling_mori_15_10,Yeah... I get that a lot.
d_counseling_mori_15_11,I guess you're no exception.

d_counseling_mori_16_11,Thanks for finding it for me.
d_counseling_mori_16_12,"Oh, hi, Evaluator. Have you seen my intrenching tool by any chance?"

d_counseling_mori_19_4,I think you're good at digging.
d_counseling_mori_19_5,Eating?! What a useless skill!
d_counseling_mori_19_6,That reminds me... I'm starving!
d_counseling_mori_19_7,"Uh... I suppose that's true,"
d_counseling_mori_19_8,but being good at digging won't exactly get you further in life.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_1,Little Mermaid wakes up inside the bubble.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_2,Ah uh...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_3,!!
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_4,A stream of silver liquid flows past the bubbles.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_5,It's already that time again.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_6,Watch it with caution.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_7,Approach the bubble tree.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_8,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_9,There is nothing that will change even if she stares at the silver liquid.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_10,Just swirling and trying to consume each other when it collides with the bubbles.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_11,... Just watching doesn't help.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_12,Is there anything else I can do...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_13,Little Mermaid talks to herself as she places her hand on the bubble tree.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_14,"If I want to push it back, I need to make more bubbles."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_15,Please... someone help me.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_16,"All that Little Mermaid can do now is offer a small prayer,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_17,"but, small as it is, this meager prayer is the only glimmer of hope found in such overbearing solitude."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_08_18,Little Mermaid spends her day by the bubble tree and silver liquid.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_1,Little Mermaid wakes up inside the bubble.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_2,How long has it been? I wonder.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_3,"When I first arrived, I counted the days by stacking the bubbles."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_4,Try to count the days and retrace memories.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_5,Don't think about it.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_6,The tenth year was when I stopped keeping track.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_7,"That would mean that now, I've been here..."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_8,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_9,I don't think I can even calculate it anymore.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_10,"Besides, knowing exactly how long it's been would only make me feel more lonely."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_11,Hmm.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_12,I may have to spend more of my life inside this place than outside it.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_13,Best not to obsess over time too much.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_09_14,Another repetitive day commences once more.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_5,Don't say anything.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_6,Ah...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_7,Ah woo!
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_8,It's been so long since I've heard the sound of my own voice.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_9,"Hehe, I ought to talk to myself once in a while, or else I might forget how to speak."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_10,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_11,For days now...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_12,"No, for weeks. Months. Maybe even for years, Little Mermaid has not been talking."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_13,"Has she forgotten how to talk with someone else, or has she lost the ability to speak altogether?"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_14,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_10_15,She begins her day reminiscing on how things used to be so full of verve and vitality.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_3,Maybe I can send something out.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_4,Stay still.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_5,Send out a bubble doll.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_6,Ah woo...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_7,I better not try anything out of the ordinary.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_8,It could end up causing issues.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_9,I'll just sit back and watch this time.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_10,Little Mermaid pushes down the small shrivel of hope she had...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_11,"If a bubble doll manages to get through that hole,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_12,someone might discover me.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_13,Maybe... just maybe... they  could be the ones who find me.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_14,Little Mermaid holds onto that small shrivel of hope...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_11_15,... and begins her day.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_5,What's this?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_6,Someone's photo album.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_7,Some canned food.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_8,Wow...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_9,"Most of the colors have faded, so it's lost a bit of its impact,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_10,but I can still feel the memories contained within it.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_11,"If I ever see them again, I'll make sure that we take plenty of photos like this for posterity."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_12,You brought food? Thanks.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_13,"I've only been eating when it's absolutely necessary, so I still have enough provisions, but"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_12_14,it never hurts to have more food available.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_2,A lot was eaten this time.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_3,"In particular, I see a lot of Raptures."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_4,Remain hidden and lie low.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_5,Stay alert.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_6,It wouldn't be good to attract attention.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_7,I'll stay as quiet as possible.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_8,... At least until they're all dissolved by the silver liquid.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_9,"Considering how many of them there are,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_10,"I should stay on guard, just in case."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_11,Soon after.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_13_12,"... Thankfully, none of them seem too interested in the space that I'm in."

d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_4,What should I do?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_5,Clean.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_6,Do nothing.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_7,I'll make this place spick and span.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_13,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_14,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_14_15,"On second thought, I feel kind of lazy doing that."

d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_4,Abe is strong. What would she say in this situation?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_5,What are you whining about? Pull yourself together and push through it!
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_6,"Sometimes, it can be too much for me too."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_7,Hehe.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_8,"Yeah, I can see her saying something like that,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_9,all while patting me on the shoulder reassuringly.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_10,... All right. I've got to be strong.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_11,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_12,Even someone as strong as Abe
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_13,has to go through rough patches on occasion.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_15_14,But if that's true...

d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_3,Ah uh ah.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_4,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_5,I wonder how everyone always understood what I was saying?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_6,They understood based on intuition.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_7,They actually didn't understand.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_8,"Yeah, that's probably it."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_9,That means that
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_10,they really knew me.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_11,Having friends who truly understand me... it's an amazing feeling.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_12,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_13,"As crazy as she knows it sounds,"
d_counseling_littlemermaid_16_14,"Little Mermaids starts to become paranoid that no one actually understood her, and only pretended."

d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_5,"Even so, make an effort to do something."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_6,Lie around all day.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_7,"Once I get up, I'm sure there will be something I can do."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_8,Little Mermaid forces herself up and feels a crushing wave of exhaustion wash over her.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_9,Ah woo...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_10,...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_11,"She then thinks better of it, and slumps back down on the ground."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_12,Abe always said that rest is important.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_13,I'm also really comfortable lying down here.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_17_14,"I'll rest a little, just for today."

d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_3,"When she meets her friends again, Little Mermaid wonders what the first thing she'll say is."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_4,I missed you.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_5,What took you so long?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_6,"If I do ever meet them again,"

d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_9,"I don't resent them, not even a little bit."
d_counseling_littlemermaid_18_10,I don't think I'd say that to them.

d_counseling_littlemermaid_19_5,A fish got in! Was this part of the bubble too thin?
d_counseling_littlemermaid_19_6,Ah...
d_counseling_littlemermaid_19_7,Levi always liked grilled fish.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_19_8,Eat some grilled fish.
d_counseling_littlemermaid_19_9,"Keep it inside as a pet, and a friend."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_02_3,"How is it that you manage to handle me so well, Commander?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_02_4,"Because you taught me, step by step."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_02_7,I taught him so that he could handle me?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_02_8,If he's been properly trained... then maybe he and I can enjoy a few things together.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_03_9,"His answer shows that he sees Yuni for who she is, without any preconceived bias."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_03_10,The fact that he hesitated must mean he felt some discomfort.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_03_11,Oh well.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_04_7,That was exactly what I wanted to hear.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_04_8,He must have been thinking of cinching it around my wrist and cutting off the circulation.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_04_10,"Hmm... of course, belts are typically meant to be worn as clothing,"

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_05_4,What should I have said instead?

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_05_7,"I realize that for most people, bumping into another person is an unpleasant experience, and so you apologize."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_5,"Sounds a bit overwhelming, to be honest."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_6,I wonder what my reaction was?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_7,I imagine I must have been disappointed with being rejected.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_8,"But then again, having some alone time with Yuni is also precious in its own way,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_9,so maybe I was grateful that he picked up on that and respected it.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_06_10,"Hmm, I guess we didn't get together as a trio."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_8,but I don't think my tastes have changed all that much.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_9,Maybe he was more stimulating than I remember?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_10,"Haha, I think he was correct."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_11,He must have been more stimulating than I thought.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_12,"And since I do love things which stimulate me,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_07_13,he was perfect for me.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_2,Hmm...
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_3,I feel oddly tired today.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_4,How about taking a rest?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_5,How about some stimulation?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_6,That couldn't have been too long after we met each other.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_7,"Otherwise, he would have known my fatigue came from a lack of stimulation."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_8,"The more I rest, the stronger the stimulation I require."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_9,"The fact that he responded like that must mean we must've had some very stimulating conversations afterward, huh?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_10,I'm sure my fatigue completely vanished.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_11,"It's just a guess, but I probably kept coming up with excuses to see him more often. Hehe."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_12,"Of course, the fact that my life is on the line is plenty stimulating, so I don't have time to rest now."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_08_13,Mihara lets out a bitter smile as her fingers gently brush the necklace around her neck.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_3,What if I felt pain like other people do? What would happen?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_4,Then you wouldn't be you.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_5,Wouldn't that be a good thing? You could live normally.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_6,He's right... The pleasure I find in pain has become my very existence.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_7,"So naturally, my end will be pain as well."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_8,"Haha, what a simulating life!"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_9,"Normal, huh?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_10,Doesn't seem like a word that fits me all that well.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_09_11,"Besides, once I've tasted pleasure, I'm not one to let it go, hehe."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_2,Hmm... The pain you and Yuni inflict feels strangely different somehow.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_3,"Could you try hitting my hand, Commander?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_4,Hit hard.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_5,Hit with controlled strength.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_6,"While I don't remember all the details,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_7,I do have a vague memory of how that hit felt.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_8,Yuni and I are careful to hold back so we don't end up breaking each other. But I guess he couldn't manage that... being a beginner and all.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_9,"However, that kind of clumsy roughness can sometimes bring a novel kind of thrill."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_10,"While I don't remember all the details,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_11,I do vaguely remember thinking he was being too gentle.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_10_12,"I usually prefer being treated more roughly, but... I wonder if I enjoyed his kindness as well?"

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_3,Would you like to take a look later?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_4,What did you get? Some snacks or drinks?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_5,"I assume I need to head to the dungeon, yes?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_6,"Right. Unless you're more specific, most people would assume you were talking about food or something similar."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_7,"From what I can remember, that club had another section inside."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_8,"It was super dark in there, and there were all sorts of goodies inside."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_9,"If he'd noticed that, it would have been much more fun, hehe."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_10,He picked up on it right away.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_11,He must have been a regular at the club.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_12,I wonder how many conversations we shared there?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_11_13,I want to remember everything.

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_3,Will I still be with you and Yuni?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_4,Of course. We'll always be together.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_5,I don't know... Nothing is certain.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_6,I seem to recall being grateful for those words then.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_7,"We may not be together now,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_8,but let's make sure that we meet again.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_9,"I don't remember how I reacted, but he was right."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_10,"After all, no one knew this is how we would end up."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_12_11,"Reality is the harshest mistress of them all, hehe."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_2,I'm curious.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_3,"What is the worst pain you've ever felt, Commander?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_4,When I got pierced through the stomach.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_5,The pain of losing someone precious.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_6,The human body isn't built to endure such pain.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_7,It must have been excruciating for him.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_8,I hope that pain doesn't haunt him.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_9,"He's right, emotional suffering is frightening."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_13_10,"I have yet to lose someone precious to me, at least permanently."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_3,Someone from a session before me must have left it.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_4,Who does it belong to?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_5,Yuni.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_6,Biscuit.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_7,"You must have known that I was next and left it on purpose,"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_8,"isn't that right, Yuni?"
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_9,Yuni tilts her head while making a cooing sound.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_10,"Haha, thanks. I'm sure I had a fun time thanks to you."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_14_13,"Anyway, I imagine I must have been a little disappointed."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_3,do you still think we could converse if we weren't able to speak one day?
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_4,Of course.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_5,It might be a little difficult.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_6,He's right. Spoken words are just a small part of conversation.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_7,I'm sure he'll be able to
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_8,have a perfectly pleasant conversation with Yuni when he meets her.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_9,"Generally speaking, that's true."
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_10,Being unable to speak would render communication rather difficult.
d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_15_11,"But even if it's difficult, you can still have a conversation as long as you understand one another."

d_counseling_mihara_bondingchain_20_5,It's only a dream. It doesn't mean anything.

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_05_11,You mean that game where the mustachioed guy explores a haunted mansion?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_05_12,"Yeah, that one's a classic. It got better and better with each sequel, too."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_05_13,"Still not quite BOOM-level, though, hehe."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_01,"If we entertain the notion that ghosts really exist,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_02,what kind of weapon would you need to fight one?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_03,A chainsaw.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_04,A BFG.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_05,"Chainsaws are a great way to get things started,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_06,but would they really work on a ghost?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_07,I feel like physical attacks wouldn't work on them.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_08,"Unless they're electricity-based, that is. Then it might do something."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_09,"Yeah, the BOOMbastic Fantasm Gun might actually have an effect!"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_10,"Ghosts are probably more vulnerable to elemental attacks than physical ones,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_11,especially when it comes to electricity.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_12,That's because strong bursts of electricity create lots of light!
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_06_13,Elegg and I brainstorm weapons that could take down ghosts.

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_01,"This EMF reader is normally used to detect electromagnetic fields,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_02,but some people also apparently use it to track ghosts.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_03,Do you think there's anything to that?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_04,I don't think there's much evidence to back that up.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_05,Seems plausible to me.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_06,That's what I think too.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_07,EMF readers only react to electric waves.

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_17,"If ghosts really did exist,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_18,I'd bet they would be plasma based.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_19,"Hmm, and if that were true, an EMF reader would be able to detect them."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_20,If ghosts are made of plasma...
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_07_21,Does that mean we could use them as a power source to play BOOM?

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_08_04,Hand over some extra fizzy sparkling water.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_08_05,Hand over an energy drink with electrolytes.

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_06,"BOOM's fun no matter the weather! Hot or cold, rain or shine."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_07,It's always a blast to play!
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_08,I'm talking about games that are just more exciting when you play them during a specific time of year.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_09,Horror games do go well with summer.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_10,An unexpected jump scare can hit you like a hammer to the chest.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_09_11,"Then the chills creep in, and you get goosebumps all over."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_01,A cruise ship of this size must need an insane amount of electricity.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_02,To supply that much power...
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_03,Would take a massive battery.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_04,Means there must be a generator onboard.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_05,Hmm...
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_06,"A ship this big probably could carry a huge battery,"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_07,but I still don't think that would be enough.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_08,Precisely!
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_09,"To power a massive cruise ship like this, you need a generator the size of a small building."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_10_10,"Since they're so heavy, generators are usually placed in the lower hull to help balance the ship."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_04,"Oh, Mr. Commander!"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_05,I was thinking of setting up BOOM around here.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_06,I'm trying to find an appropriate spot to display it.
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_07,How about projecting it on the spray from the water fountain?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_08,How about we project the video onto the deck?
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_09,Ooh!
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_10,"Yes! If we use the water spray like a screen, we could beam the video onto it."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_14,"The only thing is, this deck's made of wood."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_11_15,"There are certain wooden displays out there, but they're a bit finicky and hard to work with."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_13_07,"What do you think? Feels pretty nice, doesn't it?"
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_13_08,"It's breathable material, so there's no sweat buildup, and it's so light, that it barely feels like you have it on."

d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_16_07,"Personally, though, I prefer other colors."
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_16_08,I knew it!
d_Counseling_elegg_boomandshock_16_09,Electricity and yellow are synonymous with each other.

d_counseling_k_03_11,But I don't agree.
d_counseling_k_03_12,K and I have a serious debate about necessary evil.
d_counseling_k_04_title,Advising K: 04
d_counseling_k_04_1,"Hey, I've noticed you've been hanging out with D a lot."
d_counseling_k_04_2,What do you two get up to when you're alone?
d_counseling_k_04_3,Missions.
d_counseling_k_04_4,Dates.
d_counseling_k_04_5,Oh.
d_counseling_k_04_6,K's face brightens.
d_counseling_k_04_7,"Right. Missions. Hehe, makes sense."
d_counseling_k_04_8,I really am an idiot for asking something so obvious.
d_counseling_k_04_9,"Sorry about that, heh."
d_counseling_k_04_10,*Sigh*...
d_counseling_k_04_11,K's face darkens.
d_counseling_k_04_12,No wonder she's been going out dressed to the nines.
d_counseling_k_04_13,"She's got some ulterior motive, huh?"
d_counseling_k_04_14,I tell K more about what D and I do when we meet up.
d_counseling_k_05_title,Advising K: 05
d_counseling_k_05_1,How do you let off steam whenever you're angry?
d_counseling_k_05_2,I listen to calm music and relax.
d_counseling_k_05_3,I release that pent-up energy by belting out karaoke songs.
d_counseling_k_05_4,What the hell?
d_counseling_k_05_5,That actually works?
d_counseling_k_05_6,"If anything, doing that would just annoy me more."
d_counseling_k_05_7,Hold up.
d_counseling_k_05_8,You're a fan of karaoke?
d_counseling_k_05_9,Why don't you and I go together next time?
d_counseling_k_05_10,K and I have a spirited debate on the best way to release anger.
d_counseling_k_06_title,Advising K: 06
d_counseling_k_06_1,Do you really think
d_counseling_k_06_2,these counseling sessions do anything?
d_counseling_k_06_3,Of course.
d_counseling_k_06_4,Honestly? I'm not sure.
d_counseling_k_06_5,Haha.
d_counseling_k_06_6,"Well, aren't you just full of confidence."
d_counseling_k_06_7,I like that about you.
d_counseling_k_06_8,I enjoy how you don't beat around the bush.
d_counseling_k_06_9,What the heck? What's with that half-baked answer?
d_counseling_k_06_10,"If you don't even know, how do you expect anyone else to?"
d_counseling_k_06_11,K and I have a long conversation about the significance of counseling.
d_counseling_k_07_title,Advising K: 07
d_counseling_k_07_1,"So, tell me."
d_counseling_k_07_2,Is there anyone you like?
d_counseling_k_07_3,D.
d_counseling_k_07_4,You.
d_counseling_k_07_5,Is that so?
d_counseling_k_07_6,Why don't you go and say that to her face?
d_counseling_k_07_7,Wh-what?!
d_counseling_k_07_8,Aren't you embarrassed about
d_counseling_k_07_9,blurting out stuff like that?
d_counseling_k_07_10,Y... You really caught me off guard!
d_counseling_k_07_11,K and I have a conversation about things and people that we like.
d_counseling_k_08_title,Advising K: 08
d_counseling_k_08_1,I wonder what small happiness is.
d_counseling_k_08_2,Winning the lottery.
d_counseling_k_08_3,That feeling you get when you've completed a mission and get to relax.
d_counseling_k_08_4,?
d_counseling_k_08_5,Isn't that a little too big for what we're talking about?
d_counseling_k_08_6,"Not only that, but the odds of winning the lottery are slim to none."
d_counseling_k_08_7,Wait... have you ever hit the jackpot before?
d_counseling_k_08_8,"Ah, I see."
d_counseling_k_08_9,I think I get it.
d_counseling_k_08_10,"Whenever I complete a mission and I'm still in one piece, I automatically feel at ease."
d_counseling_k_08_11,I suppose that does count.
d_counseling_k_08_12,K and I chat for a while.
d_counseling_k_09_title,Advising K: 09
d_counseling_k_09_1,What kind of weather do you prefer?
d_counseling_k_09_2,I like sunny days.
d_counseling_k_09_3,I like cloudy days.
d_counseling_k_09_4,I thought you'd say that.
d_counseling_k_09_5,I'm not a big fan of sunny days myself.
d_counseling_k_09_6,Too bright.
d_counseling_k_09_7,You do?
d_counseling_k_09_8,I like overcast days too.
d_counseling_k_09_9,Less light means it's easier to hide. Makes me feel safer.
d_counseling_k_09_10,K and I converse about the weather.
d_counseling_k_10_title,Advising K: 10
d_counseling_k_10_1,"It's time for our counseling session, but K hasn't shown up."
d_counseling_k_10_2,*Zing*
d_counseling_k_10_3,Phew...
d_counseling_k_10_4,There is blood splattered on part of K's body.
d_counseling_k_10_5,Another mission well done.
d_counseling_k_10_6,Would you like to wash up?
d_counseling_k_10_7,Huh?
d_counseling_k_10_8,What kind of greeting is that?
d_counseling_k_10_9,"I was in a rush to get here, so I didn't have time to clean up."
d_counseling_k_10_10,Let me borrow your shower for a moment.
d_counseling_k_10_11,Huh?
d_counseling_k_10_12,Am I dirty?
d_counseling_k_10_13,"Sure, I'll go get cleaned up."
d_counseling_k_10_14,I wait for K to finish showering.
d_counseling_k_11_title,Advising K: 11
d_counseling_k_11_1,What do you do on your day off?
d_counseling_k_11_2,I go out.
d_counseling_k_11_3,I stay in my room and catch some more Z's.
d_counseling_k_11_4,"Oh, that's unexpected."
d_counseling_k_11_5,I figured you'd stay at home and sleep all day.
d_counseling_k_11_6,Where do you go when you head out?
d_counseling_k_11_7,"Come on, tell me."
d_counseling_k_11_8,Don't you think it's a waste to just sleep the whole day away?
d_counseling_k_11_9,"When you're dead, you'll be able to sleep to your heart's content."
d_counseling_k_11_10,Isn't there anything else you want to do with your time?
d_counseling_k_11_11,K and I have a conversation about how we spend our days off.
d_counseling_k_12_title,Advising K: 12
d_counseling_k_12_1,"K leans on the sofa, looking thoroughly unentertained."
d_counseling_k_12_2,I'm bored stiff.
d_counseling_k_12_3,I turn on the tablet and hand it over to K.
d_counseling_k_12_4,Do you want to read something?
d_counseling_k_12_5,Do you want to play a game?
d_counseling_k_12_6,You've got to be joking.
d_counseling_k_12_7,Just looking at words gives me a headache.
d_counseling_k_12_8,Put it away.
d_counseling_k_12_9,Then how about a game?
d_counseling_k_12_10,A video game?
d_counseling_k_12_11,"Seriously? What are you, a kid?"
d_counseling_k_12_12,... What kind of game is it?
d_counseling_k_12_13,Turn it on.
d_counseling_k_12_14,A while later.
d_counseling_k_12_15,...
d_counseling_k_12_16,... This is actually kinda fun.
d_counseling_k_12_17,"K and I enjoy a nice, relaxing time together."
d_counseling_k_13_title,Advising K: 13
d_counseling_k_13_1,How do you judge what's good and evil?
d_counseling_k_13_2,"I'm righteousness personified, aren't I?"
d_counseling_k_13_3,It depends on the situation.
d_counseling_k_13_4,?
d_counseling_k_13_5,I'm being serious.
d_counseling_k_13_6,Quit kidding around and give me a serious answer.
d_counseling_k_13_7,Right.
d_counseling_k_13_8,That's usually how it goes.
d_counseling_k_13_9,A very pragmatic answer. I like it.
d_counseling_k_13_10,K and I have a serious conversation about what constitutes good and evil.
d_counseling_k_14_title,Advising K: 14
d_counseling_k_14_1,*Zing*
d_counseling_k_14_2,"Ugh, what a day."
d_counseling_k_14_3,Nothing's going right.
d_counseling_k_14_4,*Bang*
d_counseling_k_14_5,K kicks the sofa as soon as she comes in.
d_counseling_k_14_6,"Hey, that's expensive!"
d_counseling_k_14_7,What's wrong?
d_counseling_k_14_8,So what?!
d_counseling_k_14_9,How much money can a damn sofa cost?
d_counseling_k_14_10,I'll pay for it!
d_counseling_k_14_11,"Nothing, it's just..."
d_counseling_k_14_12,*Sigh*...
d_counseling_k_14_13,You won't believe what just happened to me.
d_counseling_k_14_14,I listen to K vent.
d_counseling_k_15_title,Advising K: 15
d_counseling_k_15_1,I got an order from the higher-ups that I've got a serious issue with.
d_counseling_k_15_2,"If you were me, what would you do?"
d_counseling_k_15_3,I'd protest at least once.
d_counseling_k_15_4,Orders are orders. I'd follow it.
d_counseling_k_15_5,You're right.
d_counseling_k_15_6,I'd feel sick to my stomach if I didn't say anything.
d_counseling_k_15_7,"All right, good."
d_counseling_k_15_8,I'll try talking to them.
d_counseling_k_15_9,What?
d_counseling_k_15_10,... I don't like that.
d_counseling_k_15_11,Surely there must be another way.
d_counseling_k_15_12,I tell K all the different ways she can raise an objection.
d_counseling_k_16_title,Advising K: 16
d_counseling_k_16_1,"When we first met,"
d_counseling_k_16_2,what was your first impression of me?
d_counseling_k_16_3,You seemed lively.
d_counseling_k_16_4,You seemed intense.
d_counseling_k_16_5,Huh?
d_counseling_k_16_6,In what world does that word suit me?
d_counseling_k_16_7,Are you mocking me?
d_counseling_k_16_8,Haha.
d_counseling_k_16_9,You really do understand me.
d_counseling_k_16_10,A lot of people are intimidated by me.
d_counseling_k_16_11,K and I have a conversation about first impressions.
d_counseling_k_17_title,Advising K: 17
d_counseling_k_17_1,I don't feel like talking here today. This room is suffocating.
d_counseling_k_17_2,Let's go out for some fresh air.
d_counseling_k_17_3,Sure.
d_counseling_k_17_4,"No, we can't do that."
d_counseling_k_17_5,I'm glad you made it easy.
d_counseling_k_17_6,"If you'd refused, I was gonna drag you out myself."
d_counseling_k_17_7,"Now that it's decided, let's move."
d_counseling_k_17_8,What do you mean we can't?
d_counseling_k_17_9,*Whoosh*
d_counseling_k_17_10,K picks me up.
d_counseling_k_17_11,Don't be such a stickler. Let's go out for a while.
d_counseling_k_17_12,I go out for some fresh air with K.
d_counseling_k_18_title,Advising K: 18
d_counseling_k_18_1,You should see how people beg once I've caught up to them.
d_counseling_k_18_2,It's absolutely hilarious.
d_counseling_k_18_3,"They treat other people's lives with disdain, yet they think their own is so precious."
d_counseling_k_18_4,It's enough to really piss you off.
d_counseling_k_18_5,That's only natural. Everyone values their own life.
d_counseling_k_18_6,Those people are so selfish.
d_counseling_k_18_7,What?!
d_counseling_k_18_8,Are you seriously defending those people?
d_counseling_k_18_9,Wow.
d_counseling_k_18_10,How noble of you.
d_counseling_k_18_11,All they care about is themselves.
d_counseling_k_18_12,"They'll say that they'll do anything, as long as you spare them."
d_counseling_k_18_13,"Crying, begging, and groveling on the floor."
d_counseling_k_18_14,It's like something out of a comedy show.
d_counseling_k_18_15,"Ugh, just thinking about it pisses me off."
d_counseling_k_18_16,K and I talk about how trying missions can be.
d_counseling_k_19_title,Advising K: 19
d_counseling_k_19_1,"Every time I come here, this place is immaculate."
d_counseling_k_19_2,Do you have someone who cleans for you?
d_counseling_k_19_3,"No, I clean it myself."
d_counseling_k_19_4,"Yes, but it's not a regular thing."
d_counseling_k_19_5,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_k_19_6,Tell me your cleaning secrets.
d_counseling_k_19_7,D is always on my case for not cleaning my room properly.
d_counseling_k_19_8,"I swear, it's driving me crazy."
d_counseling_k_19_9,How do you do it?
d_counseling_k_19_10,"Ah, right."
d_counseling_k_19_11,You're a big shot in the Ark.
d_counseling_k_19_12,I suppose it was a silly question.
d_counseling_k_19_13,Never mind. I was hoping you'd be able to share some cleaning hacks.
d_counseling_k_19_14,I talk to K about how she can do a better job cleaning.
d_counseling_k_20_title,Advising K: 20
d_counseling_k_20_1,I haven't seen you around the hotel lately.
d_counseling_k_20_2,Was there something about the service you didn't enjoy?
d_counseling_k_20_3,"In fact, there was."
d_counseling_k_20_4,"No, I've just been really busy."
d_counseling_k_20_5,What?
d_counseling_k_20_6,What is it?
d_counseling_k_20_7,Hurry up and tell me!
d_counseling_k_20_8,"Ah, I see."
d_counseling_k_20_9,"Well, if that's the reason, then I guess it can't be helped."
d_counseling_k_20_10,"Apparently, their room service got an overhaul recently."
d_counseling_k_20_11,They've got a few new options they want you to test... or so I heard.
d_counseling_k_20_12,Just saying.
d_counseling_k_20_13,K and I talk more about the room service at the hotel.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 01
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_1,Your Grace.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_2,Are you going out right now?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_3,"Yes, I am."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_4,Let's go swimming together.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_5,Let's go for a walk together.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_6,Swimming?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_7,I'm afraid I'll have to decline.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_8,I cannot bear the idea of my clothes getting wet.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_9,"Instead of swimming, why don't we simply go out for some fresh air instead?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_10,Is there even a place near here that's suitable for strolling?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_11,Well.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_12,"Even so, it's at least a better suggestion than swimming."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_13,"Very well, I'll walk with you."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_01_14,Dorothy and I take a brief walk.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 02
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_1,"Your Grace,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_2,what are you staring at so intently?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_3,That parasol you're holding.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_4,Your swimsuit.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_5,This parasol?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_6,It looks so fancy.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_7,... Mmm.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_8,You have better taste than I thought.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_9,This is one of my favorite parasols.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_10,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_11,I didn't pick out this design simply so you could ogle at me endlessly.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_12,Must you be so blatant about it? Honestly.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_02_13,Dorothy and I have a short chat.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 03
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_1,You were making some tea?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_2,I certainly didn't expect you to be the one serving me tea.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_3,I'm looking forward to this.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_4,"I know that it's hot outside, but I'm still serving hot tea."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_5,"Since it's hot outside, I'll serve the tea cold."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_6,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_7,"It's not too bad, considering that it was made by a beginner."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_8,Certainly drinkable.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_9,What are you thinking?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_10,"If you serve tea cold like this,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_11,all of the aroma disappears.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_12,Make it again.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_03_13,Dorothy critiques the tea's flavor.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 04
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_1,Do you believe in ghosts?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_2,"Sure, I believe such a thing could exist."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_3,"No, I don't think they exist."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_4,That's unexpected.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_5,You and I feel the same way about this.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_6,As I thought.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_7,I knew we'd be complete opposites on this.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_8,"I think that,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_9,"if not exactly ghosts,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_10,then something more like a spirit can exist.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_11,A long time ago... I saw one myself.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_04_12,Dorothy and I have a deep conversation about spirits.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 05
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_1,Your companions are so noisy.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_2,Please quiet them down.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_3,I'll try talking to them about it.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_4,But doesn't that liven things up?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_5,Please do.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_6,"You are their commander,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_7,so you must exhibit the authority that comes with that title.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_8,Although I'm not entirely sure whether it will work...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_9,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_10,Are you being serious when you say that?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_05_11,Dorothy and I have a conversation about noise.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 06
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_1,The sunlight is quite harsh today.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_2,Isn't this the kind of weather that you like?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_3,"You're not a big fan of this kind of weather, are you?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_4,Not at all.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_5,I prefer days when the sunshine is less intense.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_6,"I don't enjoy days where it's blazing,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_7,like it is today.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_8,Not in the slightest.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_9,... I don't remember ever mentioning that to you.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_10,It must have been a long time ago.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_11,You must have a good memory if you recall small things like this.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_06_12,Dorothy and I take a short stroll together.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 07
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_1,Dorothy is having tea by herself.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_2,I...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_3,Sneak up from behind and surprise her.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_4,Watch her from a distance.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_5,I have to tiptoe over quietly and sneak up on her...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_6,B—!
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_7,"If you yell ""Boo!"", you're in for a world of hurt."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_8,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_9,Did you really think I wouldn't catch you sneaking up on me like that?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_10,You must think very poorly of me.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_11,A few moments later.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_12,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_13,"Did you have something to say to me, Your Grace?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_14,Don't lurk over there in the distance. Come over here and talk.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_15,You're distracting me.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_07_16,I share a somewhat tense tea time with Dorothy.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 08
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_1,"What does a ""friend"" mean to you?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_2,"Someone who is happy for you when you're up, and supports you when you're down."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_3,Someone who you're close to. What else?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_4,"That's a simple, but beautiful, way of putting it."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_5,I suppose that is what friendship is.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_6,"Somehow, I had forgotten."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_7,I wasn't asking for a dictionary definition.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_8,Never mind. I shouldn't have asked.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_08_9,Dorothy and I have a casual conversation about the meaning of friendship.

d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_1,That friend of yours
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_2,"who runs around shouting, ""BOOM!"" all the time."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_3,What exactly is this BOOM?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_4,"With a mere 28MB of space, you can enjoy the greatest FPS in human history! And also…"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_5,It's a classic FPS game.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_6,Never mind.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_7,I've heard enough.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_8,I see.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_9,"Judging by how she hollers about it all day, every day,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_10,she must really be into it.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_11,"At any rate,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_12,I presume that's what's running on the monitor in the bedroom?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_13,Call her over to get rid of it. Now.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_09_14,I call Elegg to come and uninstall BOOM.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 10
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_1,I have a question.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_2,Why did you let that peddler come along?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_3,She's a useful companion in many ways.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_4,I brought her to annoy you.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_5,I suppose I have to acknowledge that much is true.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_6,She really does have everything you can imagine in stock.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_7,Even stuff that makes you scratch your head and wonder
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_8,"what she's thinking, bringing such junk."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_9,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_10,Can't even give me a serious answer...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_10_11,Dorothy and I talk about the items that Yan brought along.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 11
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_1,Dorothy is examining a starfish.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_2,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_3,Are you thinking about eating it?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_4,"Fascinating, isn't it?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_5,Of course not.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_6,But you apparently are.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_7,Would you like to take a bite? Hehe.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_8,Not particularly.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_9,I was only looking at it for a moment.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_10,"The outer texture is a bit unusual, that's all."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_11_11,Dorothy and I both examine the starfish for a while longer.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 12
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_1,Rapi has changed.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_2,Isn't that a good thing?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_3,It's hard to get used to.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_4,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_5,It would seem that she's your type.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_6,"Wow, we actually agree. Color me surprised."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_7,"When I look at Rapi now, the past comes flooding back..."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_8,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_9,Never mind. I've said enough.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_12_10,Dorothy and I chat about Rapi.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 13
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_1,Dorothy is eating alone.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_2,I...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_3,Come up casually and join her.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_4,Rock up noisily and join her.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_5,I sit in front of Dorothy and casually slide a drink towards her.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_6,?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_7,Is this for me?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_8,"... I happen to be thirsty, so I'll accept."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_9,"Wow, that looks delicious!! Mind if I join you?!"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_10,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_11,Dorothy stands up.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_12,I'm done eating. You'll have to eat alone.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_13_13,Dorothy quickly leaves the table.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 14
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_1,This is the first I've been in the middle of the ocean. I've never seen views like this before.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_2,I... I would have loved to see it together.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_3,With who? Someone close to you?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_4,With who? Me?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_5,!!
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_6,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_7,Yes. With my precious wings.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_8,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_9,You really are shameless.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_14_10,Dorothy and I spend a long time looking at the sea.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 15
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_1,What are you doing with that inner tube?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_2,I already told you I'm not interested in a swim.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_3,"You don't like getting your clothes wet, right?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_4,So let me give you a ride.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_5,Then how about just dipping your toes slightly?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_6,"Even if I'm riding on an inner tube, the water will still splash on me."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_7,"Also, it's not as if we'll be the only ones in the pool."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_8,I guarantee there will be a few people aiming to flip me over.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_9,... I suppose that's not such a terrible idea.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_10,But why are you so hellbent on getting me in the water?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_11,"You're not plotting something, are you?"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_15_12,"After much persuasion, I finally convince Dorothy to head to the pool."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 16
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_2,Dorothy is surveying her parasol with a serious expression.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_3,The end seems slightly bent.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_4,I should...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_5,Try to fix it myself.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_6,Call Centi for help.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_7,Let me have a look at it. I can try to fix it.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_8,Hmm? Er... okay...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_9,A few moments later.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_10,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_11,"Uh... is it just me,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_12,or does it look more bent than before?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_13,... I'm sorry.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_14,"In the end, I have to call in Centi for help."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_15,Centi will be able to fix that in no time.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_16,Are you sure...?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_17,Centi quickly repairs the parasol and leaves.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_18,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_19,I...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_20,I will have to repay her someday.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_21,That's for sure.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_16_22,I thank Centi separately for fixing the parasol.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 17
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_1,Your Grace.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_2,What exactly are you staring at?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_3,Your teacup.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_4,Your hand movements when you're drinking tea.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_5,You must be quite fond of this teacup.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_6,You haven't been able to tear your eyes away from it.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_7,It's an exquisite piece. Elegant and refined.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_8,"The aroma of the tea is integral to the experience,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_9,but that does not mean the visual aspects should be ignored.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_10,My hands? What about them?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_11,The way you lift your pinky finger is intriguing.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_12,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_13,There's someone I once knew who was equally fascinated by that...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_14,"I'm sorry, but some unpleasant memories are surfacing."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_17_15,Dorothy and I continue to chat.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 18
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_1,"The sea is not bad,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_2,but I'm not a big fan of the beach.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_3,Because of the sand?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_4,Because of the starfish?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_5,You're very astute.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_6,It gets stuck to your skin and clothes.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_7,The granules stick to anything and everything. It's such a hassle.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_8,What's wrong with starfish?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_9,I harbor no ill will towards them.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_18_10,Dorothy and I talk more about the beach.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 19
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_1,Hmm...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_2,Why do people bother building sandcastles?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_3,It's fun.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_4,Consider it a form of artistic expression.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_5,"No, it's not."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_6,Your entire body gets covered in sand.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_7,What an unpleasant feeling.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_8,Hmm...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_9,"I still have an ax to grind with sand,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_10,but I suppose I understand the artistic aspect of it all.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_19_11,Dorothy and I have a conversation about sand.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_title,Advising Dorothy: Serendipity: 20
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_1,One of your companions
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_2,seems to slumber all day.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_3,Is she really so fond of sleep?
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_4,"Maybe when she's asleep, she has pleasant dreams."
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_5,Maybe she feels tired often.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_6,...
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_7,Sounds nice.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_8,"If sleeping meant I could be immersed in pleasing dreams,"
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_9,I would want to sleep all day too.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_10,She is a Nikke.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_11,It would make little sense for her to feel drowsiness.
d_counseling_dorothy_serendipity_20_12,Dorothy and I have a conversation about Frima.

d_counseling_sora_01_1,"Captain, I'm here!"

d_counseling_sora_01_3,What's this all about?
d_counseling_sora_01_4,I called you in for a session.
d_counseling_sora_01_5,I called you in because I found something interesting.
d_counseling_sora_01_6,"Oh come now, is that really the only reason?"
d_counseling_sora_01_7,You think I don't know why you really called me?
d_counseling_sora_01_8,Huh?
d_counseling_sora_01_9,No other reason whatsoever?
d_counseling_sora_01_10,Not even a tiny bit?
d_counseling_sora_01_11,You did?
d_counseling_sora_01_12,Whaaaat! For real?
d_counseling_sora_01_13,"You're the best, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_01_14,Calling me the moment you find something interesting. ♥
d_counseling_sora_01_15,Can I take a look?
d_counseling_sora_01_16,"Oh, this is exciting! ★"
d_counseling_sora_01_17,I have a fun session with Sora.

d_counseling_sora_02_7,"nicely done, Captain!"
d_counseling_sora_02_8,You've got some real musical talent! ♥
d_counseling_sora_02_9,"Hopping in right on cue, hehe. ★"
d_counseling_sora_02_10,"No no, that's not how it goes, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_02_11,You've gotta sing along!
d_counseling_sora_02_12,"Here, I'll sing it again."
d_counseling_sora_02_13,"Be sure to do it properly and join in this time, okay?★"
d_counseling_sora_02_14,Sora and I belt out a nursery rhyme together.
d_counseling_sora_03_title,Advising Sora: 03
d_counseling_sora_03_1,Do you have any juicy secrets
d_counseling_sora_03_2,to share with me?
d_counseling_sora_03_3,You already know so many of mine.
d_counseling_sora_03_4,"Sure, I'll tell you. Come closer."
d_counseling_sora_03_5,What secrets? I don't have any.
d_counseling_sora_03_6,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_sora_03_7,This is gonna be great!
d_counseling_sora_03_8,"Sora leans in, bringing her ear close."
d_counseling_sora_03_9,*Whisper whisper whisper*
d_counseling_sora_03_10,Oh my gosh!
d_counseling_sora_03_11,"I see you've got a mischievous side to you as well, Captain. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_03_12,How about I share a little secret of my own as a reward?
d_counseling_sora_03_13,Really? Truly?
d_counseling_sora_03_14,"Aww, too bad."
d_counseling_sora_03_15,Well then...
d_counseling_sora_03_16,how about I tell you a little secret of mine instead?★
d_counseling_sora_03_17,Sora's eyes sparkle with mischief.
d_counseling_sora_03_18,"Sensing danger, I run from her as fast as I can."
d_counseling_sora_04_title,Advising Sora: 04
d_counseling_sora_04_1,"If you had to hide something really precious to you,"
d_counseling_sora_04_2,and you had to do it in a hurry—where would you hide it?
d_counseling_sora_04_3,"Anywhere would do, since it just needs to stay hidden for a while."
d_counseling_sora_04_4,Somewhere that doesn't stand out too much.
d_counseling_sora_04_5,"No no no, that simply won't do."
d_counseling_sora_04_6,"Even if you're in a rush, you can't go around hiding things in any old place. They'll get found right away!"
d_counseling_sora_04_7,"The more precious something is, the more carefully you have to hide it. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_04_8,Not a bad idea!
d_counseling_sora_04_9,"For example, an outer pocket? Much too obvious."
d_counseling_sora_04_10,*Click*
d_counseling_sora_04_11,Sora's finger traces down from my shoulder and stops over my chest.
d_counseling_sora_04_12,"An inner pocket would be better,"
d_counseling_sora_04_13,"but personally, I'd recommend something a bit more secure. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_04_14,Sora and I discuss ways to hide something important.
d_counseling_sora_05_title,Advising Sora: 05
d_counseling_sora_05_1,How is this thing supposed to open...?
d_counseling_sora_05_2,"Sora seems focused on something, and hasn't even noticed I'm here."
d_counseling_sora_05_3,What should I do?
d_counseling_sora_05_4,Watch her quietly and hold my breath.
d_counseling_sora_05_5,Make a small sound to let her know I'm here.
d_counseling_sora_05_6,Who designed this?
d_counseling_sora_05_7,It's so annoying.
d_counseling_sora_05_8,"Argh, this is driving me cra... Gaaaah!"
d_counseling_sora_05_9,C-Captain?!
d_counseling_sora_05_10,Sora quickly hides the item she was holding.
d_counseling_sora_05_11,The least you could do is make some noise whenever you show up! ★
d_counseling_sora_05_12,You startled me!
d_counseling_sora_05_13,Ahem.
d_counseling_sora_05_14,!
d_counseling_sora_05_15,Sora quickly hides the item she was holding.
d_counseling_sora_05_16,Captain!
d_counseling_sora_05_17,You're early! I thought you wouldn't be here for a while. ★
d_counseling_sora_05_18,How was your day?
d_counseling_sora_05_19,"As for me, well..."
d_counseling_sora_05_20,"Sora wraps up the session in record time, and hurriedly leaves the Commander's Room."

d_counseling_sora_06_1,Whoa!
d_counseling_sora_06_2,What's that trinket over there?
d_counseling_sora_06_3,It's so sparkly and pretty! ★
d_counseling_sora_06_4,Mind if I take a closer look?
d_counseling_sora_06_5,"Sure, go ahead."
d_counseling_sora_06_6,"... You're not planning on taking it with you, are you?"
d_counseling_sora_06_7,Wow...
d_counseling_sora_06_8,It looks even more amazing up close. ★
d_counseling_sora_06_9,So delicately crafted.
d_counseling_sora_06_10,It's a feast for the eyes.
d_counseling_sora_06_11,Hey!
d_counseling_sora_06_12,I wouldn't nick someone's stuff without asking!
d_counseling_sora_06_13,I mean... maybe I would if I were on the Surface...
d_counseling_sora_06_14,"But this isn't the Surface, is it?★"
d_counseling_sora_06_15,Sora spends a long time admiring the ornament before heading out.

d_counseling_sora_07_3,The sunlight pours right in.
d_counseling_sora_07_4,"I didn't realize I was such a ""brilliant"" individual, hehe."
d_counseling_sora_07_5,"Well, I have been putting a lot of effort into the upkeep."
d_counseling_sora_07_6,Pffft... haha!
d_counseling_sora_07_7,"You're funny, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_07_8,But you really are an incredible person.
d_counseling_sora_07_9,"Sometimes, I have a hard time looking you in the eye!"
d_counseling_sora_07_10,The upkeep?
d_counseling_sora_07_11,You mean like wiping windows and dusting?
d_counseling_sora_07_12,"I highly doubt you're doing all that yourself, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_07_13,Aren't those duties handled by some Nikkes on a rotation?
d_counseling_sora_07_14,"Hehe,"
d_counseling_sora_07_15,your expression tells me that I'm right. ★
d_counseling_sora_07_16,"Sora and I have a fun, innocuous chat."
d_counseling_sora_08_title,Advising Sora: 08
d_counseling_sora_08_1,"Do you like flying, Captain?"
d_counseling_sora_08_2,"Yeah, I like it."
d_counseling_sora_08_3,"No, I don't. It's scary."
d_counseling_sora_08_4,I knew you'd say that. ♥
d_counseling_sora_08_5,"It's such an incredible feeling, getting closer and closer to the light."
d_counseling_sora_08_6,And a wide open sky is a cure-all for any time you're feeling down! ★
d_counseling_sora_08_7,Flying is seriously the best! ♥
d_counseling_sora_08_8,"Oh my, are you afraid of heights?"
d_counseling_sora_08_9,For a captain to not know the joy of flying... what a tragedy!
d_counseling_sora_08_10,Sora and I talk more about flying.

d_counseling_sora_09_3,I like sunny days.
d_counseling_sora_09_4,I like cloudy days.
d_counseling_sora_09_5,"Hehe, you and I are totally in sync. ★"
d_counseling_sora_09_6,"Sunny days are my favorite, too. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_09_7,You get much more sunlight that way.
d_counseling_sora_09_8,Really?
d_counseling_sora_09_9,Don't cloudy days feel kind of gloomy to you?
d_counseling_sora_09_10,I'll always...

d_counseling_sora_10_9,"Hehe, that's so like you, Captain."

d_counseling_sora_11_9,I'm dying to know. ♥
d_counseling_sora_11_10,"Aww, that's too bad."
d_counseling_sora_11_11,"I guess I'll have to show my face around these parts more often,"
d_counseling_sora_11_12,"to make sure I'll pop up in your dreams one of these days, hehe. ★"

d_counseling_sora_12_1,"*Yaaawn*... Good morning, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_12_2,Sora looks absolutely exhausted.
d_counseling_sora_12_3,Hand her an energy drink.
d_counseling_sora_12_4,Ask her if taking a short nap might help.
d_counseling_sora_12_5,Is this for me?
d_counseling_sora_12_6,Thanks a bunch! ★
d_counseling_sora_12_7,"Um... is it okay if I save it for later, though?"
d_counseling_sora_12_8,"I drank way too much of this last night, staying up late. ★"
d_counseling_sora_12_9,Would that be okay? I just wanna rest my eyes for a bit.
d_counseling_sora_12_10,I'm seriously pooped. I felt like I was gonna pass out! ★
d_counseling_sora_12_11,Can I lie down on the couch?
d_counseling_sora_12_12,"Or... maybe I could rest on your lap instead, Captain?"
d_counseling_sora_12_13,Sora and I have a quiet session.
d_counseling_sora_13_title,Advising Sora: 13
d_counseling_sora_13_1,"One moment, Captain. ★"
d_counseling_sora_13_2,It's time for the pre-boarding inspection.
d_counseling_sora_13_3,"Spread your arms and step this way, please. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_13_4,... All right.
d_counseling_sora_13_5,Is this supposed to be some kind of skit?
d_counseling_sora_13_6,Excellent. ★
d_counseling_sora_13_7,Right this way.
d_counseling_sora_13_8,"Now then, let's get started. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_13_9,Let's see what we've got here... ★
d_counseling_sora_13_10,"C'mon, Captain, play along!"
d_counseling_sora_13_11,Just pretend that it's a practice drill before boarding.
d_counseling_sora_13_12,"Now come on over, and make it snappy! ★"
d_counseling_sora_13_13,Sora approaches me with a mischievous grin.
d_counseling_sora_13_14,*Poke*
d_counseling_sora_13_15,...?

d_counseling_sora_13_17,...
d_counseling_sora_13_18,*Poke poke poke*
d_counseling_sora_13_19,...!
d_counseling_sora_13_20,"Aha! So this is your weak spot, is it?"

d_counseling_sora_14_3,My crew.
d_counseling_sora_14_4,"You, Sora."
d_counseling_sora_14_5,Wow.
d_counseling_sora_14_6,"That wasn't the answer I was expecting,"
d_counseling_sora_14_7,but... it's really moving all the same. ★
d_counseling_sora_14_8,"I'm part of your crew, aren't I? Right?♥"
d_counseling_sora_14_9,... Captain.
d_counseling_sora_14_10,Are you trying to dodge the question?
d_counseling_sora_14_11,Be honest with me. ★

d_counseling_sora_15_1,My heart races every time we head to the Surface. ★
d_counseling_sora_15_2,"Is it the same for you, Captain?"
d_counseling_sora_15_3,Absolutely. I get nervous every time I go.
d_counseling_sora_15_4,A lot of different things get my heart racing.
d_counseling_sora_15_5,Really?
d_counseling_sora_15_6,Because it's so dangerous up there?
d_counseling_sora_15_7,"That may be true, but if you face that danger head-on,"
d_counseling_sora_15_8,there are bound to be amazing treasures waiting for you at the end! ★
d_counseling_sora_15_9,"I figured that's what you'd say, Captain. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_15_10,What kind of rare finds will we discover this time?
d_counseling_sora_15_11,How much fatter will my wallet get?
d_counseling_sora_15_12,Just thinking about it makes my heart race!

d_counseling_sora_16_2,When do you usually throw things away?
d_counseling_sora_16_3,I rarely throw things away.
d_counseling_sora_16_4,When I feel it's no longer useful.
d_counseling_sora_16_5,Wooooow. ♥
d_counseling_sora_16_6,You're just like me! ★
d_counseling_sora_16_7,"When something feels useless, huh?"
d_counseling_sora_16_8,But what if it never feels useless?★
d_counseling_sora_16_9,All my things are so precious to me. ♥
d_counseling_sora_16_10,"You know how much I love collecting stuff, right?"
d_counseling_sora_16_11,But lately... I'm really starting to run out of space.
d_counseling_sora_16_12,I thought maybe it was time to tidy up a bit...
d_counseling_sora_16_13,Or I could expand my collection instead! ★
d_counseling_sora_16_14,Sora and I have a talk about organizing and storage.

d_counseling_sora_17_2,what would it be?
d_counseling_sora_17_3,Teleportation.
d_counseling_sora_17_4,The ability to fly.
d_counseling_sora_17_5,"Ooh, teleportation sounds awesome! ★"

d_counseling_sora_18_4,Thank you very much.
d_counseling_sora_18_5,How many boxes did you buy this time?
d_counseling_sora_18_6,Don't mention it.
d_counseling_sora_18_7,"The healthier you are, the happier I am. ★"
d_counseling_sora_18_8,"Make sure you eat it every day, okay?♥"
d_counseling_sora_18_9,Huh?
d_counseling_sora_18_10,"C'mon Captain, don't make that face."
d_counseling_sora_18_11,It's not like I bought that much.
d_counseling_sora_18_12,Maybe... 20 boxes or so?
d_counseling_sora_18_13,They had a huge sale going on! I had to go all in! ★
d_counseling_sora_18_14,I talk to Sora about overspending.

d_counseling_sora_19_1,Captain.
d_counseling_sora_19_2,What do you think about Sky?
d_counseling_sora_19_3,She's a classy lady.
d_counseling_sora_19_4,There's more to her than meets the eye.
d_counseling_sora_19_5,Huh?
d_counseling_sora_19_6,Ahaha!
d_counseling_sora_19_7,You really think that?
d_counseling_sora_19_8,You're hilarious.
d_counseling_sora_19_9,"Ha, you've got her figured out, all right! ★"
d_counseling_sora_19_10,That unpredictable side is what makes her so interesting.
d_counseling_sora_19_11,"In fact, yesterday, she..."

d_counseling_sora_20_1,"Hey, Captain."
d_counseling_sora_20_2,Isn't Cielo hilarious?
d_counseling_sora_20_3,You mean when she starts talking a million miles per hour?
d_counseling_sora_20_4,She seems fairly normal to me.
d_counseling_sora_20_5,"Hehe, you really do know her well."
d_counseling_sora_20_6,"The way she stammers and blurts everything out in a rush when she gets flustered... so funny, hehe. ♥"
d_counseling_sora_20_7,Teasing her is half the fun.
d_counseling_sora_20_8,Ha!
d_counseling_sora_20_9,Looks like you haven't seen all sides of Cielo yet.
d_counseling_sora_20_10,"Take a closer look, and you'll find that she's full of surprises. ★"

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_1,Vesti has been really on my case lately about hanging out with her.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_2,"I turn her down every time, but it doesn't dissuade her."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_3,You got any ideas about how to handle this?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_4,Just hang out with her.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_5,How about avoiding her?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_6,Are you serious?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_7,Do you have any idea how much I...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_8,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_9,How much what?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_10,... Never mind. It was foolish of me to ask you.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_11,I've already been steering clear of her.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_12,"If she catches on and starts making a fuss about it, things will just get worse."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_13,So I've been keeping it as low-key as possible...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_14,but I can't keep this up forever. It's exhausting.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_01_15,I listen to Eunhwa's complaints.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_1,"I will reclaim the surface, no matter what."

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_3,"Of course, I do."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_4,"I still do, but it's getting harder."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_5,"Good, keep that up."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_6,Sharpen your skills even further
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_7,so that your words become reality.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_8,Tch. That's a pretty dispiriting answer.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_9,I bet your squadmates would just love to hear that.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_02_10,Eunhwa and I have a serious conversation about reclaiming the surface.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_1,"Tell me,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_2,how do you usually relieve stress?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_3,I spend time with other people.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_4,I meditate in silence.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_5,Ugh...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_6,Just the thought of it already stresses me out.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_7,Why would anyone choose to spend time with other people?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_8,I don't get it at all.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_9,And that's supposed to help you relieve stress?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_10,"All right, come on,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_11,show me how it's done.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_12,Do I close my eyes first?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_03_13,Eunhwa and I try out different ways to relieve stress.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_1,"Hey, Junior Blockhead."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_2,What's your definition of perfection?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_3,I think it's a word that perfectly describes Absolute.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_4,I think it's a word that perfectly describes Counters.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_5,"A brilliant answer, and straight to the point as well."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_6,You've grown a lot.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_7,Keep up the good work.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_8,What?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_9,Perfection is not a term you should use frivolously.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_10,And stop playing favorites. It's unsightly.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_04_11,Eunhwa and I have a conversation about perfection.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 05
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_1,"Eat up, Junior Blockhead."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_2,Eat quietly.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_3,Refuse to eat.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_4,This is...!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_5,What? That's it?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_6,Don't you have anything more to say?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_7,"If you're gonna eat something that a person offers you, at least give some feedback."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_8,It's delicious!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_9,"Tch, you should've said that from the start."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_10,"There's more over there, so help yourself if you want."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_11,"Emma made that, didn't she? I'm not eating that."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_12,Tch. Fine...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_13,"If you don't want to eat it, then don't."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_14,"... Judging by how Eunhwa's acting, I don't think that's the case."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_15,"A-actually, I'll have some."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_16,"I really want to, so please let me!"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_05_17,"Tch, you should've said that from the start."

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_6,What? That can't be.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_7,"... Tch, the lunchboxes got switched."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_8,I was going to punish you for being late by making you eat the special lunch Emma prepared.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_9,Guess I failed.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_10,"Emma made that, didn't she? I'm not eating that."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_11,You've got some nerve.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_12,"Considering how late you were, you've got no right to refuse."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_13,Hurry up and eat.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_14,And you better clean your plate.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_06_15,I share a tense meal with Eunhwa.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_1,Rapi's definitely changed.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_2,What do you make of it?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_3,"No matter how much she changes, Rapi's still Rapi."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_4,"She's gotten sly, so she's harder to handle."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_5,Right.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_6,"Everything else might change,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_7,but who you truly are inside never does.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_8,Rapi? Sly?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_9,... I don't buy it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_07_10,Spare me the lame jokes.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_2,To always strive for perfection.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_3,Give advice tailored to each person.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_4,That's the kind of advice I'd give.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_5,"I already know roughly what you're going to say,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_6,so don't overthink it. Just be honest with me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_7,... I expected as much.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_8,That answer is exactly what I thought you'd give.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_9,"I knew you'd say that, Junior Blockhead."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_10,"But honestly, that's what makes you you."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_11,Keep it that way.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_08_12,Eunhwa and I have a casual chat.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 09
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_1,I don't understand why Emma and Vesti
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_2,always pick out these ridiculous frilly outfits for me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_3,"They're insanely uncomfortable, not to mention completely impractical."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_4,Huh? I think it looks nice.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_5,Maybe they're just messing with you.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_6,"So just for that one reason,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_7,I'm supposed to give up everything else and wear them?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_8,I don't get it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_9,Why not? You look pretty in them.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_10,... Be quiet.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_11,Stop spouting nonsense.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_12,... Hey.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_13,Do you really think I'm dumb enough to believe something like that?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_14,You better watch it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_09_15,"For the rest of the counseling session, I find myself withering under Eunhwa's piercing gaze."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 10
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_1,"When I see you issuing commands up on the surface, you sometimes look like someone who's never known fear."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_2,Have you ever experienced that on the battlefield?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_3,"Yes, when I thought the operation would fail."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_4,"Yes, when I thought I might lose a comrade."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_5,You worry about the strangest things.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_6,"As long as you don't sustain fatal wounds, it's okay to fail momentarily."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_7,"You can make good use of the data from those losses,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_8,and win the final battle.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_9,That's a perfectly reasonable fear to have.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_10,"Once you lose a comrade, they never come back."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_11,Make sure you never forget that.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_10_12,Eunhwa and I have a serious conversation.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_2,Got any bright ideas?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_3,Just give up. It's easier that way.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_4,You should take over cooking duties every day.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_5,You think I said all that just to hear this kind of answer?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_6,You should try going through this every single day yourself.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_7,This is the one thing I absolutely refuse to give up on.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_8,You want me to do that annoying thing every single day?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_9,And come up with a different excuse each time without anyone catching on?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_10,But there's no other way...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_11,... Damn.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_12,Is that really the only way?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_11_13,Eunhwa and I try to come up with different solutions.

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_12_9,"While we're at it, could you wait just a little longer?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_12_10,Boo!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_12_11,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_12_12,I don't think she heard me. Let me try again...

d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_2,Trying to take on everything by yourself.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_3,I can't bring myself to say it.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_4,"... Tch, that stings more than I expected."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_5,Don't worry.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_6,I've got no intention of doing that anymore.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_7,... Why?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_8,I don't like that look on your face.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_9,Speak up.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_10,Tell me what it is!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_13_11,I talk to Eunhwa about her flaws.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 14
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_1,"If the day ever comes when we reclaim the surface,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_2,what do you want to do?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_3,I wonder if that day will ever come.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_4,"Hmm, I guess I should start thinking about it now."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_5,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_6,What a disappointing answer.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_7,What? You still haven't thought about it yet?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_8,Pathetic.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_9,"So, what do you want to do, Eunhwa?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_10,I...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_11,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_12,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_13,... It's a secret.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_14,"You haven't thought about it yet either, have you?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_15,... Were you even listening? I said it's a secret.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_14_16,"Today, Eunhwa and I dream of reclaiming the surface again."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 15
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_1,"When an operation fails, what should a Commander do?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_2,Analyze what went wrong.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_3,Chalk it up to bad luck.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_4,"Well, you're no rookie, so that answer should come to you right away."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_5,"Still, considering I caught you off guard, that was a pretty quick response."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_6,I'll give you some credit for that.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_7,What?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_8,What kind of crap is that?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_9,"Go ahead, say it again. I dare you."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_10,I-it was a joke...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_15_11,Eunhwa and I have a serious discussion about what a Commander should do.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 16
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_1,You're always so good about expressing your emotions.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_2,"Saying you're sorry, telling people how grateful you are, stuff like that."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_3,You can do it too.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_4,You don't need to force yourself.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_5,Try saying this after me:
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_6,Thank you as always.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_7,Tha... tha...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_8,tha... Don't be so stubborn.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_9,...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_10,... Let's move on.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_11,... And sorry for making you worry.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_12,And sorry... for... ma... ma...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_13,This is insane. How am I even supposed to do this?!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_14,I won't. I can't. I'm done.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_15,"... Tch, what are you on about?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_16,I never planned to make any effort in the first place.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_17,"If I suddenly started spouting nonsense about showing my feelings,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_18,Emma and Vesti would definitely think I'm not myself and attack me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_19,Being true to yourself is the best thing you can do.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_20,Isn't that right?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_16_21,I give up on teaching Eunhwa how to express her feelings.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 17
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_1,I received this as a gift from Vesti.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_2,Eunhwa shows me a large black cat plushie.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_3,What am I supposed to do with this?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_4,Hug it tight when you sleep.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_5,Use it as a punching bag when you're angry.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_6,"When Vesti said that, I thought she had to be joking."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_7,But that's actually what it's for?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_8,... Why would anyone use it like that? Explain it to me.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_9,"I asked you a serious question,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_10,and you respond with that drivel?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_11,I'm seriously tempted to punch you in the face.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_17_12,"With a displeased look on her face, Eunhwa hugs the cat plushie and walks away."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 18
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_1,... I'm exhausted.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_2,Do you want to lie down and rest?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_3,Would you like an energy drink?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_4,No thanks.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_5,Do you have any energy-boosting snacks?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_6,That should do the trick.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_7,"Given the kind of day it is, I won't turn that down."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_8,... Thanks.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_18_9,Eunhwa rests a bit and then leaves.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 19
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_1,"When you recognize a weakness in yourself, how do you handle it?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_2,I hide it so others don't notice.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_3,I accept that it's a weakness and try to improve.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_4,"That's not exactly wrong,"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_5,but you're also not being fully honest with yourself either.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_6,It's not like you can hide your weakness forever.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_7,"There's a better way of going about it, and you know that."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_8,That's correct.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_9,"That way, you can hold your head high"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_10,and won't feel ashamed around others.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_11,"Because in the end, you'll improve and overcome it."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_12,Keep living like that going forward.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_19_13,Eunhwa and I have a serious conversation.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_title,Advising Eunhwa: Tactical Upgrade: 20
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_1,I received this as a gift from Emma.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_2,Eunhwa shows me a small bottle of perfume.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_3,She told me to wear it next time we go out.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_4,... It's such a hassle.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_5,Tell her you broke it by accident.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_6,Why don't you just wear it?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_7,You think I haven't tried that already?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_8,Eunhwa hurls the perfume bottle to the ground!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_9,*Clank!*
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_10,"I don't know what this thing is made out of, but it's unbreakable."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_11,In that case...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_12,*Spritz*
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_13,*Cough cough!*
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_14,What kind of scent is this?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_15,"It's definitely strong, right?"
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_16,"No, more than that—it's downright toxic."
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_17,How does she expect me to wear this?
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_18,There's no way. Since it's come to this...
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_19,*Spritz* *Spritz*
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_20,I better use it all up now.
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_21,N-no!
d_counseling_eunhwa_tactical_20_22,Eunhwa and I are overwhelmed by the pungent perfume for a while.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 01
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_1,"Commander, do you have a moment before we start our session?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_2,Sure. What's up?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_3,"Hehe, it's nothing serious. You know how I got an upgrade recently?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_4,"I can now spray the liquid stored here into the air,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_5,so I was thinking of giving you a little aromatherapy with it.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_6,"Sure, we can do that for a bit."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_7,Let's finish our counseling session first.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_8,"Hehe, shall I get started then?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_9,*Pshhhh*
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_10,"A pleasant herbal scent fills the air,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_11,and my eyes grow heavy.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_12,"Oh my, Commander, you must be really worn out."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_13,"Hehe, why don't you just lie down over there? I'll give you a nice massage too."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_14,"Hmm... Well, if you say so, Commander, I guess I can't argue with that."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_15,I'll make sure we finish quickly today.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_16,"Hehe, got it. Commander, you're always so kind. I really love that about you."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_01_17,"After the aromatherapy session, I am completely healed in both body and mind."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 02
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_1,"Commander, how do you think squad members should follow their leader?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_2,I'd really love to hear your thoughts.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_3,Follow closely behind the leader.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_4,Move forward alongside them.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_5,"Hehe, that's true too."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_6,But I think it's really important to have squadmates who walk beside the leader and help carry the load.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_7,"That way, the leader can keep running forward without having to stop."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_8,"Hehe, I figured that's the way to go."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_9,"Leader or member, we're all in the same squad."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_10,So I think it's best we stand side by side and be each other's strength.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_02_11,Emma and I have a conversation about how to follow one's leader.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 03
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_1,"I packed you a lunchbox today, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_2,*Click*
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_3,"Ta-da! How is it? It looks more amazing this time, doesn't it?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_4,Inside the lunchbox is something that resembles Dark Matter.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_5,"All right, can you say ""ahh"" for me?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_6,Ah...
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_7,Ah...
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_8,W-wait!
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_9,*Gulp*
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_10,!!!
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_11,"Hehe, it makes me happy seeing you eat so well."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_12,"If I'd known you were this hungry, I'd have made even more."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_13,"Oh my, what's wrong?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_14,"Come to think of it, I just ate."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_15,Really?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_16,"Hmm... Well then, I guess it can't be helped."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_17,"You'll have to be sure to eat the one I make next time, okay?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_03_18,I decide to always eat before Emma's counseling sessions from now on.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 04
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_1,"When you were up against an enemy that seemed impossible to beat,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_2,"how'd you manage to win, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_3,I subdued them with my perfect tactics.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_4,I gave it my all until I won.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_5,"Hehe, your tactics are certainly impressive, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_6,"But to me, it feels like there's something more than just tactics at play."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_7,"Hehe, that answer is so you, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_8,"I sometimes think there are things more important than tactics,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_9,and those things often help lead to victory.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_04_10,Emma and I have a conversation about how to overcome powerful enemies.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 05
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_1,"Even with our recent upgrades, Eunhwa still pushes herself too hard sometimes."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_2,I still worry about her.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_3,Maybe it's because she knows you and Vesti have her back.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_4,It's because she's a perfectionist.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_5,You're the strongest squad in the entire Ark.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_6,"... Now that I think about it, you're right. Hehe."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_7,"Since Eunhwa believes in me that much, it's only right that I return the favor."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_8,"Because we're the strongest, after all."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_9,"Of course, it's great to be perfect…"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_10,but I just wish she'd think about how worried her squadmates get.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_05_11,I listen to Emma's worries.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 06
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_1,"How about it, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_2,Wanna try touching it this time?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_3,"The Counters scolded me for asking you before, but they're not here now."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_4,I'll have to pass again this time.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_5,Maybe I'll try touching it just once.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_6,"Oh, Commander, that's unexpected. I thought you wouldn't say no this time."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_7,"Hehe, to think I'd get rejected twice…"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_8,I'm kinda hurt.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_9,"Hehe, splendid choice."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_10,"Now, how about coming a little closer for a moment?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_06_11,I spend some time with Emma to check out the new outfit.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 07
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_1,Whew...
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_2,"Sorry, Commander, but can I borrow your shower for a bit?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_3,"I had to use all sorts of liquids during today's operation, and now I'm all sticky."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_4,Go ahead. I'll step out for a bit.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_5,Can't you just shower back at your dorm later?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_6,"Oh, you don't have to go through all that trouble."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_7,"Just turn around for a sec, okay?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_8,... Okay.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_9,*Rustle rustle*
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_10,Hmm... but...
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_11,I think it'll be hard for me to focus on our session.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_07_12,"After Emma finishes showering, we begin the counseling session."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 08
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_1,"Despite the upgrade, my firepower is still weaker than Eunhwa and Vesti's."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_2,I want to be more helpful. Is there anything I can do?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_3,How about getting a new weapon?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_4,You're already doing something only you can do.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_5,Hmm… a new weapon?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_6,"We just completed the Tactical Upgrade,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_7,"so getting one right away might be a bit tough, don't you think?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_8,!!
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_9,You're right. I kinda forgot for a moment. We all have our own roles in the squad.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_10,"Thanks for reminding me, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_08_11,Emma and I talk about her worries.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 09
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_1,"Um, Commander,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_2,I'm a little tired today.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_3,Mind if I rest here just for a bit?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_4,Go lie down on the bed over there.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_5,I've never seen you like this before.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_6,"Today, it's my turn to give you some therapy."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_7,"Oh my, Commander, what's this? I can't wait!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_8,"Hehe, I'll be counting on you then."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_9,"Hehe, sometimes even I want to lean on someone and take a break."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_10,"So, Commander, what's your answer?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_09_11,I change today's counseling session to give Emma a break.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 10
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_1,"Commander, which do you like more?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_2,How I look now or how I looked before?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_3,I like how you look now.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_4,I like how you looked before.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_5,"Hehe, that's a relief."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_6,"Honestly, I like how I look now better too."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_7,It really feels like I'm moving forward compared to before.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_8,What? Really?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_9,Hmm... Maybe it's better if I swap bodies before meeting you from now on?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_10,I'm just kidding. I like you better the way you are now.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_11,Yeah?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_12,"Whew, thank goodness. For a sec there, I thought you were serious and was about to get all worked up."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_10_13,Emma and I talk about which version of her I like better.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 11
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_1,"Commander, do you remember what we talked about during our previous session?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_2,About how my intuition is so sharp that it actually gives me a hard time?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_3,"Yeah, you said sometimes you end up knowing things you didn't want to."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_4,"Oh my, you remembered!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_5,"So tell me, what do you think happened after that?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_6,I guess you're putting that ability to good use.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_7,I think you're still having a hard time.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_8,"For example, it helped with teamwork."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_9,"Hehe, that's exactly right."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_10,My job is to keep track of how Eunhwa and Vesti are doing and give them the right support.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_11,"It's all thanks to you, Commander. Thank you."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_12,"Yeah, that's true,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_13,but I guess I'm using it in a way that's a bit more helpful.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_11_14,Emma and I talk about what we discussed in our previous session.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 12
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_1,"Hey, Commander, check this out."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_2,Vesti gave me this outfit not too long ago.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_3,What do you think? Does it suit me?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_4,I think it suits you well.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_5,"It looks a bit small, though."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_6,"Hehe, it's a gift from Vesti,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_7,so of course it'll look great.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_8,"Hehe, I'll just go change real quick. Wait right here for me, okay?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_9,"Hmm, but Vesti took her time picking this out for me..."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_10,"It's the thought behind the gift that counts, right?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_11,I'll go try it on and be right back.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_12_12,Emma puts on the outfit that Vesti gifted her and shows it off for quite a while before leaving.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 13
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_1,Hmm... which one should I pick?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_2,Emma looks at her phone screen with a serious expression.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_3,What are you doing?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_4,"Oh, Vesti and I are picking out a gift for Eunhwa right now."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_5,"Commander, would you like to pick one too?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_6,A cute doll.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_7,A sky-blue dress.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_8,"I'm not entirely sure if Eunhwa would like it, though."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_9,"Hehe, this is just between us,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_10,"but even if Eunhwa says all that,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_11,she still keeps all the gifts she gets neatly in her room.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_12,So I think a doll would be just fine.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_13,"Hmm... This one's cute too,"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_14,but it's kinda like what Eunhwa usually wears around the dorm.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_13_15,Do you have any other ideas?

d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_3,*Flick*
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_4,Emma holds out a photo to me.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_5,You all look happy.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_6,Were you guys fighting before this was taken?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_7,"Hehe. I know, right?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_8,I hope we can have more photos like this.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_9,"With you watching over us, I'm sure we will."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_10,"Oh, you're saying that because of Eunhwa's expression, right?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_11,She was sulking a bit back then 'cause Vesti teased her.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_12,"Hehe, but when you look at them like this, they're both just so cute!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_14_13,Emma and I look at her photo together.

d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_1,"Don't forget we're meeting up next week, okay?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_2,"Vesti really had to gather a lot of courage to ask you, so you have to come, all right?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_3,Of course.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_4,"Hehe, that's great."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_5,Is there anywhere in particular you'd like to go with us?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_6,The hot springs.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_7,The Maid Cafe.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_8,"Oh, it'd be wonderful if we could all go together after such a long time and unwind from the fatigue we've built up."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_9,Oh! I should bring some essential oils along.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_10,"That way, I can give you a nice, relaxing massage!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_11,"Oh my, what an unexpected place! That really surprised me."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_12,I'll ask Eunhwa about it. I'm so curious what she'll say! Hehehe.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_15_13,I decide on the place to hang out with Absolute next week.

d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_4,makes me so proud as someone who's been watching over them.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_5,I wonder what others think of me?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_6,You've changed a lot too.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_7,You seem more or less the same.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_8,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_9,"Hehe, what a relief!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_10,"The two of them have changed so much, I was worried I might be the only one who remained the same."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_11,"Hehe, is that how I look?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_12,"Oh dear, that won't do..."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_13,"I guess I'll just have to change even more so you'll notice me, Commander."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_16_14,Emma and I talk about the changes in Absolute.

d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_1,"Commander, don't you think you should have at least one cologne?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_2,"If you want, I can make one for you."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_3,Is there a particular scent you like?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_4,What do you recommend?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_5,The scent you wore today.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_6,Hmm... It's really hard to choose since pretty much any scent suits you.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_7,Could you maybe be a bit more specific?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_8,"Hehe, I didn't put on any perfume today."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_9,"So, you like my natural scent, Commander?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_10,"If you want, feel free to sniff a little more."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_11,Maybe that'll help me figure out exactly what kind of scent you like.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_17_12,Emma and I explore what kind of fragrances I prefer.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_title,Advising Emma: Tactical Upgrade: 18
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_1,Hmm... It'd be nice if we could hang out regularly when we're off duty.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_2,Do the Counters do something like that?
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_3,We always grab something tasty after every mission.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_4,We all meet in the Commander's Room at shower time.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_5,"Oh my, that sounds like a wonderful idea!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_6,"We've gotta do that too. Since we have so many missions, we'll get to see each other a lot."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_7,"Hehe, thanks for the great idea, Commander!"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_8,"Oh, so you all actually shower together?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_9,That's interesting. I had no idea the Counters had a habit like that.
d_counseling_emma_tactical_18_10,"Er... sorry, but I think you misunderstood what I was saying."

d_counseling_emma_tactical_19_9,"Yeah, something like that."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_19_10,I happened to catch a glimpse and saw she's written down a whole bunch of things she wants to do with us.

d_counseling_emma_tactical_20_5,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_20_6,I didn't think you'd agree so readily. I'm surprised!
d_counseling_emma_tactical_20_7,"Hehe, Vesti's going to be over the moon when she hears this."
d_counseling_emma_tactical_20_8,"Oh my, really?"
d_counseling_emma_tactical_20_9,Then we'll have to give you one this time.

d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_4,H-how do you think... I could get her to go out with us?
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_5,"She seems like she doesn't want to, so maybe just give up."
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_6,How about waiting at a place Eunhwa frequents?
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_7,I-I know she doesn't want to...
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_8,"But I don't want to give up,"
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_01_9,'cause I wanna get closer to her!

d_counseling_vesti_tactical_06_5,"Vesti opens a photo album labeled ""Shaking Eunhwa."""

d_counseling_vesti_tactical_07_10,I think so too.
d_counseling_vesti_tactical_07_11,Hehe... But I've decided not to rush things.

d_counseling_vesti_tactical_09_4,"I think she'll like anything from you, so long as it's from the heart."

d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_1,That punk Soda...
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_2,"She must have changed at least a little bit by now, yeah?"
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_3,She's still the same.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_4,She's changed a lot.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_5,Huh? Really?
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_6,"Well, that's no good."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_7,She promised a real fight the next time we saw each other.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_8,"If you fought her now, you might be surprised."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_9,"Oh, really?"
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_14_10,"Haha, I guess my training paid off."

d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_3,You.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_4,Ade.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_5,"Haha, that's what I thought!"
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_6,I've honed my skills in the Under Arena. I'm nothing to sneeze at!
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_7,"Thanks, Pal. You helped boost my confidence."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_8,"Huh, really?"
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_9,"Well... she has gotten special training, or so I've heard..."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_15_10,"Still, you never know until we actually square up!"

d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_16_4,Why don't you do a collab with Maid For You?
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_16_5,You could work at the cafe in your outfit.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_16_6,Hmm... I dunno about that one.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_16_7,I don't think Sugar and Frima would be game.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_16_8,Still... I'll try bringing it up to them.

that look on your face really rubbed me the wrong way."

d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_17_12,"Oh, I see."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_17_13,Then you got a kick out of Ade clinging to you earlier?

d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_18_3,Look how far you've come.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_18_4,"You better be on your toes, Milk."
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_18_5,It's all thanks to our special training.
d_counseling_milk_bloomingbunny_18_6,"With your current outfit, I might even be able to best you."

d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_12,"However, i-if you had stared any longer, I would have my crumbled in my resolve...!"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_13,!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_14,M-Master?! If you approach me so suddenly...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_15,Ade squeezes her eyes shut.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_16,Hrrngh...!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_17,Hrrrrngggghhh!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_18,... Are you sure you've calmed down?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_19,I... I was not prepared for you to approach me like so!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_20,"I-I was merely startled, that is all!"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_14_21,I test to see if Ade has really calmed her nerves.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_title,Advising Ade: Agent Bunny: 15
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_1,"M-Master, if you could indulge me."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_2,"Among the bunny girls here,"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_3,who is most suited to your preferences...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_4,Rouge.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_5,"You, Ade."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_6,Ah... I see.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_7,I believe I now understand your preferences quite well.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_8,...!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_9,R-really?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_10,Did you merely choose me because I questioned you...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_11,Nope. I'm serious.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_12,Eep...!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_13,Th-thank you.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_15_14,Ade and I talk more about which bunny girls I like.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_title,Advising Ade: Agent Bunny: 16
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_1,"Master, by chance, is there anything you wish to ask me?"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_2,"Actually, yeah. You said that you became a bunny girl at Mustang's request, right?"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_3,"Yes, that is correct."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_4,"O-of course, I refused at first."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_5,Is it because you didn't want to show me?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_6,Gotta love Mustang.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_7,... N-no! That is inconceivable!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_8,Please do not misunderstand my intentions...!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_9,It is merely that...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_10,Merely what?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_11,B-because I am embarrassed for you to see me in such a manner! Oh dear... I cannot believe I uttered such a thing out loud...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_12,"In the end, you have seen me in this outfit regardless..."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_13,so I suppose Mr. Mustang must be chuckling to himself over his own witticism.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_14,"Well, I'm a big fan."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_15,"I-if you are pleased, Master... then it is quite worth it to me."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_16_16,Ade continues to explain to me why she refused to wear the bunny girl outfit at first.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_title,Advising Ade: Agent Bunny: 17
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_1,"Hehe, I never expected coordinating with Miss Milk to be such an enjoyable endeavor."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_2,It has been a while since I've felt this way. How lovely it is.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_3,I'm sure Milk feels the same way.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_4,Milk says she wants to fight you.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_5,...! Is that so?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_6,"Hehe, I am quite pleased to hear it."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_7,"I would like to see her again, should the opportunity arise."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_8,I would like to treat her to some tea at our cafe.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_9,D-did she really say that...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_10,Hm... I suppose I can consider her request.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_11,"However, my skills are meant to protect others, not harm them."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_17_12,I have a conversation with a very cheerful Ade.

d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_1,"Do let me know if you ever need anything, Master."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_2,"I may be dressed differently, but I'm always your dutiful maid, ready to serve you."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_3,Can you cast a spell that makes food taste better?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_4,"As professional as ever, Ade."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_5,I hand over the beverage I was drinking.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_6,"Hehe, of course, Master. Please give me a moment."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_7,"Tasty, tasty! Coochie woochie!
Turn this drink into something fruity!"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_8,"Oh, wow..."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_9,"Eek... M-Master, if you keep staring at me so such, I will be unable to finish my spell...!"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_10,... B-boing!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_11,"Hehe, I thank you for the compliment."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_12,"Then today, in my capacity as a professional bunny girl, I will do my best to serve you, Master."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_13,Erm...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_14,However... c-could you please stop staring at me in such a manner?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_18_15,"I have a conversation with the ever devoted professional, Ade."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_title,Advising Ade: Agent Bunny: 19
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_1,"I have always emphasized being prim and proper,"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_2,but now that I am showing this risqué side of me...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_3,"I must say, it is quite embarrassing..."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_4,I like it.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_5,You'll get used to it.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_6,R-really...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_7,It's all part of your charm.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_8,Master...!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_9,"Hehe, I am afraid you've left me quite speechless."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_10,Do you really believe I will grow accustomed to this outfit...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_11,"I... I am not sure that I agree with you, Master."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_12,"Eep! P-please, don't stare at me like so!"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_19_13,I comfort the embarrassed Ade.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_title,Advising Ade: Agent Bunny: 20
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_1,M-Master? Why are you staring at me so intently?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_2,I just noticed that your glasses...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_3,"Hehe, I took them off for the moment."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_4,It is of the utmost importance to be as comfortable as possible while working as an agent.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_5,"H-however, per that look on your face..."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_6,Do you not like my current appearance...?
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_7,"No, I think you look great."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_8,I think you look better with glasses.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_9,?!
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_10,I...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_11,Erm...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_12,Th-thank you...
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_13,"... Hehe, I see."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_14,"It is only for a bit longer, so please bear with me, Master."
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_15,"My mission will soon be completed,"
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_16,and I will once more return to the Ade you know.
d_counseling_ade_agentbunny_20_17,Ade and I have a conversation about her not wearing glasses.
