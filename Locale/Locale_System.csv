Surprises always come from the most surprising places.

SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_21050,"You've found a dead Commander.
Check his backpack...
Apparently, this Commander fought to his last breath to defend humanity and reclaim ground.
If you take up his fight, I'm sure the dead Commander would be happy."

Most people don't even notice when they are in luck

SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22030,"Luck can take various forms when it comes knocking at your door.
It's not usually something we can control.

What will you do? Will you send a Nikke to get it? Or..."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22070,"It seems that the parts needed to repair Nikkes are the same as for repairing Equipment.
Which one will you repair first? The Nikke, or the Equipment?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22080,"You've discovered two containers with electronic locks.
One of them contains repair parts, and the other contains fighting equipment.
Your power is running low. It looks like you can only open one of them right now."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22090,"You've discovered a Repair Center with a low battery.
At this rate, it should be able to resurrect one Nikke...
Or, it can restore all standing squad members to full effectiveness.
Whichever you choose, it will use up all of the battery."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22100,"It's an eternal dilemma for a Commander.
Will you sacrifice your colleagues for total victory, or save them and leave some objectives unfinished?
Sweetie, how do you plan overcome this dilemma?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22110,"Do you believe in luck?
I do. And I think our luck is good.
If you feel the same, Sweetie, then let's try our luck!"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_22120,"Hah! Nothing happened!
Do you find that boring?
Well, considering it's raining bullets out there, ""nothing"" is the best we can hope for. Don't you think?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23010,"""Sacrifice the few for the greater good.""
We often hear that and take it for granted.
But, what would you do if you actually had to make that choice?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23020,"""Sacrifice the few for the greater good.""
We often hear that and take it for granted.
But, what would you do if you actually had to make that choice?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23030,"Out with the old, in with the new...
It may seem profitable, but what if you can't decide which old thing to throw away?
Could you bear the sense of loss when an old, familiar object suddenly leaves your life?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23040,"""Sacrifice the few for the greater good.""
We often hear that and take it for granted.
But, what would you do if you actually had to make that choice?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23050,"High risk, high return. Low risk, low return.
Which one do you prefer, Sweetie?
Oh, and investments with a low risk and a high return only exist in dreams, so don't even dream about it."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23060,"A Nikke has offered a deal.
“If you give me something of yours in exchange for something of mine, then I'll repair parts for you.”
This is a truly suspicious deal, but Sweetie, you may not have a choice."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23070,"You have an opportunity to turn the tide.
But, your colleague will get hurt. 
What would that colleague think under these circumstances? And what would you think, Sweetie?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23080,"You have an opportunity to turn the tide.
But, your colleague will get hurt. 
What would that colleague think under these circumstances? And what would you think, Sweetie?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23090,"A conscript medic once said,
“Give me one Fighting Equipment, and I'll fix every Nikke that can no longer fight.”
Colleagues are very valuable, but you need to think calmly."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23100,"Have you heard a story where one man's sacrifice saved the lives of many?
Tell me, Sweetie. What do you think about that?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23110,"Do you like doing a coin toss?
Isn't it charming to determine the outcome with a 50-50 chance?
I believe there's no fairer rule in the world."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23120,"Do you believe in luck?
I do. And I think our luck is good.
If you feel the same, Sweetie, then let's try our luck!"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23130,"Do you believe in luck?
I do. And I think our luck is good.
If you feel the same, Sweetie, then let's try our luck!"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23140,"A dying Mechanic has been discovered. There's only one way to fix it.
And that is sparing it some of your Core Energy.
You may lose something if you choose to help.
But the Mechanic will share all its knowledge and technology with you if you save its life."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_23150,"A Converter driven by Core Energy is discovered in an old factory.
This Converter is manufactured with the lost technologies and its performance is guaranteed.
What's your decision?
Do you want to suffer the loss and enjoy its benefits?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_24010,"We've run into a serious crisis.
But still, we are lucky. After all, we were able to choose this crisis for ourselves."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_24020,"We've run into a serious crisis.
But still, we are lucky. After all, we were able to choose this crisis for ourselves."
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_30010,"I'm so happy!
Here's some good stuff for you.
Keep up the good work!"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_30020,"I'm so happy!
Here's some good stuff for you.
Keep up the good work!"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_30030,"A great reward for my hard-working sweetie!
Such tender moments are needed every now and then, right?"
SIMULATIONROOM_EVENT_DESC_30040,"A great reward for my hard-working sweetie!
Such tender moments are needed every now and then, right?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_1_1,"Let's start things off lightly, shall we?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_1_2,"Shall we begin?
Are you ready?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_1_3,"Treat me well, Sweetie."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_2_1,"You're pretty good, 
but that really shouldn't be a surprise."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_2_2,Second Simulation begins!
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_2_3,"The first simulation is the easiest of them all...
Now you'll be up against the second simulation."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_1,"You've already reached this point? 
All right, you have my full and undivided attention."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_2,Third Simulation begins!
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_3,"Oho! You're the only Commander who has come this far. 
Am I too much of a bully to say this?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_1_1,"That was fast. 
I'm not going too easy on you, am I?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_1_2,"That was... very impressive. 
All right, it's my turn."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_1_3,Hmph! I should have known that this will be a cinch for you.
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_2_1,"Second simulation is going to be over soon, so stay frosty."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_2_2,"If you rest on your laurels, you're toast."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_2_3,"Here already? All right, 
I won't cut you some slack anymore."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_1,"Third Simulation is coming to an end. 
Impressive!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_2,"I'm impressed you've made it this far. 
I'll give you that much."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_3,"The last battle is right around the corner. 
Make sure you're prepared."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_1_1,"The first simulation has ended.
Now, you wouldn't mind me juicing it up a bit, right?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_1_2,"I guess that was a little too easy for you. 
I shouldn't have held back."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_1_3,"Good job on making it this far.
See ya later."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_2_1,"That's the end of the second simulation. 
Are you ready?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_2_2,"This is the last stage, so you better watch out. 
I'm going all out now."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_2_3,"I'm not pulling any punches, 
so try not to get beaten too quickly."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_1,"It's the final battle! 
C'mon, we can do this."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_2,"En garde! 
Never mind... It's just a simulation, after all."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_3,"You've made it far enough. 
It's time for me to take the gloves off. 
So here I come!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_1_2,"What do you think of the Simulation Room?
Quite a trip, innit?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_1_3,"How's the environment here? 
Not too bright, is it?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_2_1,"Do you think this simulation will really be of help in real life?
Hmm... I'm not too sure myself."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_2_2,"How are things here, Sweetie? Having fun?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_2_3,"Take your time.
We have all the time we need."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_1,"The Simulation Room feels rather stuffy.
I'd love to head outside."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_2,"Enikk and I are apparently sisters, 
but I've never seen her before."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_3,What purpose will I possibly serve when the surface is recaptured?
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_01,"Chalk one up for me, hehe!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_02,"You aren't trying to pick a fight with me, are you? 
You're kidding, right?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_03,"How would you like me to defeat you? 
Tell me, Sweetie."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_01,"Close, but I'll be the victor, though."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_02,"It's hard to predict this one, 
but I'm gonna give it all I've got."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_03,"I'm not sure who's gonna win, 
but you'll know when you fight, right?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_01,"I may be at a slight disadvantage, 
but I'm not too worried. 
I'm sure you'll make a few slip-ups."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_02,"You may have the advantage, 
but I'll get the best of you if you let your guard down."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_03,"You think you've won? 
Think again."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_01,Hmmm... Not looking good.
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_02,"Hmm... It's going to be a bore, isn't it?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_03,Wake me up when the battle is over.
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Easy_1,"Simulation Overclock Ready.
Shall we give it a try?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Easy_2,Do you prefer stability to adventure?
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Normal_1,"Simulation Overclock Ready.
Shall we begin?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Normal_2,"This is sure to be a blast!
Let's see what you've got."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Hard_1,"Simulation Overclock ready.
Are you really up for it?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Hard_2,"No risk, no gain!
All right, I'll do my best to improve my performance as well."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Easy_1,"Wow, not bad!
But don't get too complacent, it's not over yet."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Easy_2,"Huh? Have you already come this far?
Isn't this Overclock?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Normal_1,"Great, you're doing well.
Looking forward to your next round."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Normal_2,"Amazing!
I think you can handle this level easily now."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Hard_1,"Wow, impressive!
You're almost there now. Hang in there!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Hard_2,"Amazing! So far, so good.
Let's see you bring your A-game for this one!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Easy_1,"It's already over?
I barely turned away for a moment, and you've won."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Easy_2,"Humph, I was hoping for some serious fun this time around."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Normal_1,"Nearly there now!
Is the Overclock okay for you?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Normal_2,"C'mon, fight to the end!
The rewards will be worth it!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Hard_1,"Are you okay?
You're nearing the end, so it'll only get harder."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Hard_2,"Win this, and it will all come to an end. Good luck!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Easy_1,"What's the purpose of Overclock, you say?
Well, I've heard it's a contingency in the event of any danger."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Easy_2,"Haha, is it too easy for you right now?
But you should never let your guard down."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Normal_1,"I created the Simulation Room for fun after seeing a game made by a certain Nikke.
I never expected that I would still be here."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Normal_2,"Although I'd like to meet Enikk,
I feel that it wouldn't be for a good reason, so I'd rather not meet her."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Hard_1,"Keep this helpless feeling in mind.
It's exactly how you'll feel when you have to handle Enikk."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Hard_2,"Since you've tried Overclock,
does it mean I'm about to get out of here soon?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_01,"Wow, you're going to give this a try?
Haha, how interesting."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_02,"Unless you're counting on a miracle, it seems I'm about to win."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_03,"This won't be a walk in the park,
so will you still take on the challenge?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_01,"You're no longer a rookie Commander, so it's time to take the gloves off."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_02,"I believe my victory is imminent,
but I won't let my guard down."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_03,"This won't be easy.
Think you've got what it takes?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_01,"Wow! You're not even falling behind in Overclock.
I might actually lose if I'm not careful."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_02,"You may have the upper hand,
but the battle's far from over."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_03,"Why are you laughing?
If you let up, you might end up eating some humble pie."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_01,"... Shucks, I can't believe I'm losing.
What kind of Overclock is this?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_02,"What's the deal with this whole Overclock thing?
I'm so done with it!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_03,"You make winning look so easy!
Choose a higher difficulty next time!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Infinite_1,"Simulation Overclock: Infinite ready. 
It's time to get serious."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Start_3_OC_Infinite_2,"You're already familiar with overclock, right?
In that case, how about we finish with practice and try it for real?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Infinite_1,"Haha, you're holding up well.
I'm sure this won't be enough to get the best of you.
Let's give it our all until the end, okay?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_JustBeforeEnd_3_OC_Infinite_2,"I knew playing with you would be the most fun.
I'd love to keep doing this in the future... but is that asking too much?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Infinite_1,"Hmm, we're nearing the end.
What a shame... I wanted to play a bit longer.
Is there any way we can keep playing together?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_End_3_OC_Infinite_2,"We're near the end again, Sweetie.
Make sure to treat this as if it's real life, and don't let your guard down."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Infinite_1,"Wow, amazing. How far do your abilities go, I wonder?
This kind of strength isn't something ordinary humans are capable of."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_LOCATION_Random_3_OC_Infinite_2,"Until now, it felt like I was watching you grow... But now, it feels like I'm progressing along with you.
Could this have been the true purpose of overlock all along?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_INFINITE_01,"It's tough, isn't it? Painful, even?
But that doesn't mean I'll go easy on you. The real world doesn't show any mercy."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_INFINITE_02,"You're really going to try this?
I have to applaud you for your gumption."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARDER_OC_INFINITE_03,"Nothing beats winning a fight that seemed insurmountable at first.
Give it a shot."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_INFINITE_01,"Hm... I seem slightly stronger than you.
Do you find that thrilling?"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_INFINITE_02,"This is the most fun for me; when our skills are closely matched, but I have the upper hand!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_HARD_OC_INFINITE_03,"It seems the odds are in my favor, but this is the real thing, so perhaps I should still keep my guard up."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_INFINITE_01,"Even after all that, you've still got me on the ropes.
You're incredible!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_INFINITE_02,"Looks like you have the advantage...
But still, you never know the outcome until the very end!"
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASY_OC_INFINITE_03,"According to my predictions, your victory is all but guaranteed.
Still, I won't hand you a win on a silver platter."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_INFINITE_01,"Darn, it looks like I'll lose again. 
You've progressed faster than I thought."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_INFINITE_02,"Ah, it's over. Forget it, I don't need to stay and watch.
I'm going to bed."
SIMULATIONROOM_DIALOGUE_BATTLE_EASIER_OC_INFINITE_03,"My predictions indicate that you'll decisively emerge the victor, despite the difficulty.
You really can do anything."
