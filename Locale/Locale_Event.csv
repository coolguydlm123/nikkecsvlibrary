It brings back memories of someone from the past, someone she misses greatly."
whitememory_item_8_description,"An old cassette tape containing an old pop song that Red Hood was particularly fond of.
Humming along with the song brings back waves of nostalgia.
Perhaps that is why Red Hood was such a fan of this tune.


""Our hometown is far away.
The blazing blue sky.
The savory scent of the bakery.
The laughter of friends.

A gust of wind blows.
Please tell my friends.
My soul will return,
to the sky above our hometown.

White clouds float across.
Please tell my friends.
My bones will be buried,
in the earth under our hometown.

Oh, the hometown I long for.
The friends I miss.
Even if the sky above us is forever grey,
We'll return to our hometown someday."""

whitememory_item_10_description,"A pocket knife, which is from the same series as the one Scarlet carries.
Staring at it, Snow White recalls what Scarlet once said, ""All things eventually come to an end.""
Endowed with a natural proficiency in melee combat, Scarlet is well-versed in wielding edged weapons.
In her hands, even a small pocket knife can become a deadly weapon."
whitememory_item_11_description,"A parasol owned by someone who lived near the river long ago.
Dorothy once said that using the parasol made her feel as if she was basking in the warmth of the sun.
It would be an appropriate gift for Dorothy, who has to deal with the pressures of being a leader."
whitememory_item_12_description,"Red Hood's favorite magazine.
It is a quarterly magazine, featuring attractive, muscle-bound men and women in various states of undress.
Rapunzel always went red in the face whenever she so much as glanced at the magazine, for which Red Hood always enjoyed teasing her.
Now, Red Hood is nowhere to be found, and those playful interactions are no more.
Thinking of that evokes a sense of sorrow within Rapunzel."
whitememory_item_13_description,"A delicate flower that shimmers a pale white day and night.
Liliweiss.
It came to be revealed that her name was derived from this flower.
The flower, which is an integral part of memory between Liliweiss and Snow White, is the key to facing her."
whitememory_item_14_description,"The dog tag worn by the commander of the Goddess squad.
It was discovered in the meadow near the entrance of the Ark.
It reminds her of the kiss Liliweiss gave to the commander as a prayer for his safety.

where we utilize the most cutting-edge technology.

We are committed to providing
an optimal work environment 
and great benefits for our employees.

If you have any comments, 
negative or positive, 
feel free to post them in the internal forum."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_02,"A whole bunch of boxes are piled up in the central plant on the 1st floor of the HQ.
An accident is bound to happen
if we don't do something about it.
Maybe we should move them somewhere else?"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_03,"I want to talk about the door of the Dormitory Management Office.
At first glance, you can't tell whether it's a wall or a door,
so be extra careful when opening it from the inside.
I was walking down the corridor a few days ago,
and when I went to lean up against what I thought was a wall,
it turned out to be a door! 
I almost fell face-first on the ground,
so everyone keep your eyes peeled for stuff like that."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_04,"Looks like something big is happening underneath the HQ.
They've got construction going on around the clock.
Are they building some kind of extension or something? 
Maybe a recreational center or a swimming pool?
Ooooh, it'd be awesome if they give us a cafeteria that actually serves decent food!"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_05,"Any workers who see this message,
report to the Dormitory Management Office.
Remember to knock on the door 5 times.
No more, no less."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_06,"For the first time,
 I felt lucky that this place is a cannery.
I was rushing to find a hiding spot,
and I ended up hurling myself into a place with tons of food!
I'm counting my lucky stars that I'm still alive.
But I'm all alone.
It's terrifying.
Is there anyone else alive in this place other than me?
If anyone can see this,
please send a message.
If this goes on,
I'm going to go mad."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_07,"The Nikkes are here!
They're finally here!!
We did it, everyone, we survived! 
We can get out of this place and live to see another day. 
The Goddess of Victory is here to save us!"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_08,"*Buzz Buzz*
I'm iDoll series model Flower, a Nikke from the exploration squad.
During our mission, I detected an anomaly above a factory on the surface.
I am currently hiding in an outbuilding inside the factory compound.
I don't know if what I detected was a late-model Rapture, but it didn't appear to exhibit any particular aggression when it noticed me.
I will continue to observe."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_09,"*Buzz Buzz*
The object has a large, round body, 
around which is an oversized ring of some kind. 
Somewhat similar in form to Saturn.
As far as I know, no sightings of such a Rapture have been reported before.
I need to notify the Ark ASAP, 
but I can't move just yet.
Hope this message will eventually reach the Ark."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_10,"*Buzz Buzz*
The object is still hanging in the air, absolutely still.
What is its purpose?
What is it looking at?
Perhaps it is already serving its intended function simply by existing?
There's no way to know."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_11,"*Buzz Buzz*
The main body of the creature is covered by a shimmery membrane.
I opened fire upon it,
but this had no discernible effect. 
Even more disconcerting is that 
the trajectory of my bullets was thrown off the moment they came near the membrane.
To test my theory, I threw some stones,
and the same phenomenon occurred. 
This leads me to believe that any physical means of attack are futile against this being."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_12,"*Buzz Buzz*
It's starting to make sounds!
*Rumble Rumble*
Errrr...
My ears!
I'm going to disconnect for now."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_13,"*Buzz Buzz*
There were loud noises in the factory, and ear-splitting screeches.
Then there were two earth-shattering reverberations in quick succession.
It sounded like something colossal had plummeted to the ground.
Were it not for my compromised leg,
I would go inside and investigate.
As of now, all I can do is observe further and attempt to make contact later."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_14,"*Buzz Buzz*
The Rapture hanging in the air has started moving!
It's heading straight for the factory HQ.
If it makes contact, the entire factory will collapse!
Wait... it's disappeared inside the factory..."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_15,"*Buzz Buzz*
The Rapture over the factory is no longer visible.
I have no idea where it has gone,
but it appears that my observation has come to an end. 
I can hear someone approaching...
*Crunch (door opening sound)*
A Nikke?
A Product 12 model?
Is she here in response to my SOS?
Why isn't she saying anything...?
*Bang Bang Bang*
Raptures?
Why are there so many of them?
How could they know where we are hiding?
Everybody, run!
*Tuk Tuk Tuk (gun fire)*
*Buzz Buzz*"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_16,"I have a new mission.
The Nikkes going with me are
iDoll Sun, iDoll Ocean, Soldier OW, Soldier FA, and Product 23.

Soldier OW and I have run a few missions together before.
I'm lucky to have her along, as it'd be pretty lonely to be on a team composed entirely of new faces. 

Word is that we are heading into a Rapture-free zone,
so we don't have anything to worry about.
That's all for today."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_17,"We are heading to the mission area. 

I'm curious about what it will be like to go on an assignment with Nikkes of the same model as me.
Soldier OW and iDoll Sun, who have partaken in high-profile missions,
have done jobs with Nikkes of the same model as themselves before.

However, they both expressed a strong dislike for it.
They mentioned that the identical voice and weapon made them feel disgusted.
Despite that, I still believe it could be a positive experience.
Wouldn't it feel like having a twin sister?"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_18,"There are Raptures in the factory. 
Why is that?
We were told there would be none. 
Were we assigned to the wrong mission?
Are we not in the right place?
We don't know anything.
This is terrifying.
It feels like Raptures are going to swoop in and kill us any second.
Do we really have what it takes to stand up against them?"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_19,"Soldier OW was killed by a Rapture.
They're everywhere.
With her dying breath, she urged me to try to survive this.
She wanted me to live her life for her.
She said, ""I know we are mass-produced Nikkes and we'll all end up in the scrap heap, but life still goes on.""
""It has to.""
""Avenge me.""
""Keep shooting, and they'll fall.""
""You can do this."""
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_20,"Don't die. Don't leave me behind.
I don't want to be alone.
Please. Don't leave me alone."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_21,"I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to die.
I can go back as soon as I kill these Raptures, right?
What should I do when I get back?
How about taking a nice, long nap?
I'll have some dreams,
and when I wake up, I'll treat myself to a tasty snack
and binge-watch the latest shows on Tetra TV.
I heard they'll be playing movies in the dorm lounge starting next week.
I can't miss that.
It'd be so fun to see a movie.
There are so many things I have left to do.
I must survive.
Even though it's just me,
I have to go on living.
That's the spirit we should aspire to live by, isn't that right?
I am going to fight.
Only one Rapture left.
Only one Nikke left.
I have to aim and shoot.
Until I defeat it,
or until it defeats me.
Haha.
Can I take it down?"
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_22,"I see faces just like mine all around me.
All those familiar faces shooting at the Raptures.
Getting torn apart by the Raptures' bullets.
Being killed, and born again.
Killed, born. Killed, born.
Killed, borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn, kiiiillllleeeed, boooooooo..."
ce002_event_minigame_archive_description_23,"Familar faces.
I've had enough."

island_adventure_fish_small_06_description,"Maiden: I caught a pufferfish!
Jackal: No, this is a cactus!
Maiden: Eh? It looks like a pufferfish to me.
Jackal: It's a cactus!
Rapi: ... It's clearly a pufferfish."
island_adventure_fish_small_07_description,"Maiden: This fish looks like it would taste like strawberries!
Mary: Heh-heh, if you eat it, you might cough up blood the color of strawberries.
Maiden: ... Ah, then this can't be eaten."
island_adventure_fish_small_08_description,"Maiden: I've seen this in a game!
Neon: Me too! It's the game where you can bully innocent creatures and make equipment out of their skin or horns, disrupting the ecological balance, right?
Maiden: ... Come with me. I can't forgive you for saying that about that game."
island_adventure_fish_small_09_description,"Viper: Oh my, it looks like it has a bad personality.
Rosanna: Just like someone we know.
Viper: Exactly, just like someone we know.
Maiden: ... Both of you, please take it elsewhere. The atmosphere is getting tense."
island_adventure_fish_small_10_description,"Anis: Its eyes are huge. It looks like it's wearing circle lenses.
Neon: Yeah, it's a pity it doesn't trust its own eyes.
Maiden: I don't think that's something Neon should be saying, though."
island_adventure_fish_small_11_description,"Rapi: The more I look at this jellyfish, the sadder it gets.
Maiden: Yeah, why does it look so downcast?
Guilty: Should we force its mouth up to make it smile?
Maiden: Let's not do that."
island_adventure_fish_small_12_description,"Maiden: Now, this really feels like a jellyfish.
Jackal: Is this edible?
Maiden: It depends on how it's cooked... Huh? Wha?! Spit it out!"
island_adventure_fish_small_13_description,"Maiden: It sure looks like a screw. Shall I give it to Mighty Tools?
Rapi: ... I can already imagine what would happen, so maybe it's best not to."
island_adventure_fish_small_14_description,"Maiden: Oh my gosh, it's so cute!
Rosanna: Be cautious, beings that look like this are often prone to betrayal.
Maiden: Typically, betrayer characters have that squinty-eyed smile.
Mary: ..."
island_adventure_fish_small_15_description,"Anis: I think calling it Cream Puff is a bit too much.
Maiden: Why? I think it suits it.
Anis: It doesn't look sweet at all! And it even has eyes!"
island_adventure_fish_small_16_description,"Maiden: I heard lobsters are delicious when steamed.
Sakura: They say you can also enjoy them as sashimi.
Maiden: Can you help me then? You carry a sashimi knife, don't you?
Sakura: ... No, I don't."
island_adventure_fish_small_17_description,"Maiden: It looks like it would taste like chocolate!
Jackal: What? Chocolate? I love chocolate! *Lick, lick, lick*
Jackal: Blech! It's so salty and fishy!
Maiden: ... Here, have some water."
island_adventure_fish_small_18_description,"Maiden: Blue has always been the color for replenishing MP.
Neon: Are you talking about Military Point? That suits Ingrid well.
Maiden: Tac→ti↘cal→
Neon: Tac→ti↘cal→"
island_adventure_fish_small_19_description,"Maiden: Oh my, it's the colors of Counters. Red, yellow, and white.
Anis: Also, the colors of justice.
Maiden: Are Counters on the side of justice?
Anis: Who knows? The winning side claims justice, right?"
island_adventure_fish_small_20_description,"Maiden: Orange Punch! Orange Punch!
Neon: Be my exclusive Orange Punch!"
island_adventure_fish_small_21_description,"Mary: Jeez, it seems like someone threw trash into the sea.
Maiden: How can you call this trash? Please take back what you just said!
Mary: Uh, um?
Maiden: I said take it back!
Mary: Oh, um, I take it back...?"
island_adventure_fish_small_22_description,"Guilty: There are stars in the sea.
Maiden: Hmm...
Guilty: ... What's wrong?
Maiden: ... I'm wondering if it's okay for us to fish this."
island_adventure_fish_small_23_description,"Anis: Oh, I know a fish that looks like this in an anime.
Neon: Are you talking about the anime where a small fish continuously trains and eventually becomes the Dragon King?
Anis: Yeah, that one! It's really interesting.
Maiden: You sure? There's no such animation at all."
island_adventure_fish_small_24_description,"Anis: Oh mon Dieu! What kind of fish is this!?
Rosanna: ... Wh-what is this?
Sakura: ...!!
Maiden: Is everyone okay?"
island_adventure_fish_small_25_description,"Anis: Aaaah! Neon!
Maiden: How can this be...
Anis: You promised me you'd come back...! You liar!!
Maiden: *Sob*
Neon: ..."
island_adventure_fish_mid_01_description,"Maiden: The colors are so dazzling.
Viper: Yes, indeed.
Maiden: Right. Just the colors. 
Viper: Yep. Just the colors."
island_adventure_fish_mid_02_description,"Anis: Why does it look so surprised?
Maiden: Was it shocked by my incredible fishing skills?
Anis: More likely, by your thick skin."
island_adventure_fish_mid_03_description,"Viper: Oh my, there must be a story behind it. Look at its eyes.
Maiden: I feel like it's going to ask for a drink at the bar."
island_adventure_fish_mid_04_description,"Maiden: Wow, it's too...
Neon: It won't turn white when it gets angry, right?
Maiden: It doesn't have horns, so it should be fine, I think?"
island_adventure_fish_mid_05_description,"Guilty: There's coral stuck on its head. Let me remove it.
Maiden: ... You might end up removing other things too, so I'd rather you didn't."
island_adventure_fish_mid_06_description,"Neon: It looks like it can shoot spikes.
Maiden: You think so too? It would be strange if it didn't, right?
Neon: Even better if it had wings.
Maiden: Yeah, it's a pity."
island_adventure_fish_mid_07_description,"Maiden: It looks like it would scribble on the blackboard and skate around on its skateboard.
Sakura: What are you on about?
Maiden: Don't you know? It's the protagonist of a long-running classic animation. He loves donuts, has a dad, and...
Sakura: ... Let's pretend I didn't ask."
island_adventure_fish_mid_08_description,"Maiden: Hmm? This is...
Jackal: Rosanna! Heh-heh! Heh-heh-heh!
Rosanna: ...
Sakura: ... Haha."
island_adventure_fish_mid_09_description,"Maiden: There's something like a crystal stuck on its head. Should we remove it?
Rapi: That must be its defense mechanism. It's better not to touch it.
Maiden: Really? But wouldn't it make lying down and sleeping difficult?
Rapi: ... It'll be fine."
island_adventure_fish_mid_10_description,"Jackal: It's red bean bread! I want some!
Maiden: No.
Jackal: Why not? I want to eat it!
Mary: Well, go ahead then.
Jackal: No, I don't want it anymore."
island_adventure_fish_mid_11_description,"Anis: Watching the jellyfish swim feels so relaxing.
Maiden: Right, so I'm going to take a nap. Watch my fishing rod for me.
Anis: What? Why is the conversation going like...?!
Maiden: Zzzzzz...
Anis: ... Darn it."
island_adventure_fish_mid_12_description,"Anis: The name... is well-chosen.
Maiden: Wanna touch it? It's softer than you think.
Anis: No, no, thanks, no! Hold it there!"
island_adventure_fish_mid_13_description,"Rosanna: The color is beautiful.
Maiden: Do you like blue?
Rosanna: Not really, it just looks cool, so I like it.
Maiden: Then I'll give it to you.
Rosanna: ... No, thanks."
island_adventure_fish_mid_14_description,"Viper: Shooting Star? Why is it called that?
Maiden: Because when it gets angry, it splatters out like a shooting star exploding.
Viper: ... You mean this on my clothes?
Maiden: ... Yes."
island_adventure_fish_mid_15_description,"Rosanna: It looks so scary.
Maiden: Hmm? What?
Rosanna: Look, It looks like a bloody murderer walking around.
Maiden: ... It's even scarier when you say that with a smile."
island_adventure_fish_mid_16_description,"Anis: Its eyes lack a soul.
Maiden: Of course, it must be stunned by my fishing skills.
Anis: It is probably shocked that it got caught by someone with such mediocre skills."
island_adventure_fish_mid_17_description,"Neon: This one looks very kind.
Maiden: But usually, people who look like this are more aggressive, right, Sakura?
Sakura: ... Why are you asking me?"
island_adventure_fish_mid_18_description,"Anis: You...! What the hell is up with that black hand of yours?!
Neon: Heh-heh. It's because this hand has killed so many planktons that it's turned black...
Anis: You bastard...! Just how many planktons have you killed?
Neon: Can you even remember how much Splendamin you've had?
Maiden: Ah, I was going to say that!"
island_adventure_fish_mid_19_description,"Guilty: What should I do? It won't let go of my finger.
Maiden: Does it hurt?
Guilty: No, but it makes me feel bad. I want to hold its hand too.
Maiden: I-I'll take it off for you, so please stay still!"
island_adventure_fish_mid_20_description,"Anis: Don't you think it looks naked?
Viper: Isn't it a bit rich for Anis to be saying that when dressed like that?
Anis: Back at you.
Maiden: I think only its lower half is naked.
Viper: Looks like the most dangerous one here is you."
island_adventure_fish_mid_21_description,"Viper: Wow, it's sparkling!
Rosanna: Should we stick it to the front of the ship?
Viper: It can work as a lantern.
Maiden: Go on, back to the sea."
island_adventure_fish_mid_22_description,"Rapi: This is a great tactic. It has both a helmet and a melee weapon.
Anis: Don't you think it can cut through anything?
Neon: I think it probably enjoys drinking.
Maiden: What are you guys talking about?"
island_adventure_fish_mid_23_description,"Maiden: ... It's not alive, is it?
Mary: Not a chance. It would have died from lack of oxygen long ago.
Maiden: So it's dead?
Mary: Heh-heh. It's just a toy."
island_adventure_fish_mid_24_description,"Sakura: ... What's this? Why's there such a thing...?
Maiden: Ah, I'm gonna take a break.
Sakura: What's wrong?
Maiden: I feel guilty for snatching someone's house... so I need a break."
island_adventure_fish_mid_25_description,"Neon: I think Mast would like this octopus.
Anis: Yes. Hmm... should we take its hat?
Maiden: What if it's not a hat but hair?
Guilty: Then I'll help.
Anis: No, you'd better not."
island_adventure_fish_large_01_description,"Rosanna: The hairstyle looks manly and wild.
Maiden: It even looks like it has sideburns.
Rosanna: I like how determined it looks. I want to get it a motorcycle."
island_adventure_fish_large_02_description,"Maiden: What's this thing on its head?
Viper: Looks like a crown.
Rosanna: It's called the Mohawk hairstyle.
Jackal: It's poop! Heh-heh!"
island_adventure_fish_large_03_description,"Neon: It reminds me of a blind swordsman.
Maiden: Yeah. And characters with closed eyes are usually very strong.
Neon: And dark inside.
Maiden: Hah-hah, exactly.
Mary: Heh-heh. So that's what you think?"
island_adventure_fish_large_04_description,"Anis: ... I'm a bit scared of it.
Neon: Me too. Its red eyes look scary...
Maiden: Wh-what's wrong with red eyes?!"
island_adventure_fish_large_05_description,"Neon: Wow! Special individual!
Maiden: Better equipment! Stronger weapons!
Neon: Ability to launch virus!"
island_adventure_fish_large_06_description,"Maiden: I think this thing emits gas when touched.
Anis: Will it have small minions around after evolving?
Maiden: The difference is that its eyes are really big and round.
Anis: Now that you mention it... you're right."
island_adventure_fish_large_07_description,"Anis: Its name is Orange? This is too much.
Maiden: Do you have a better name?
Anis: ...
Anis: ... Orange."
island_adventure_fish_large_08_description,"Maiden: It must hurt to get pricked by its spikes, right?
Guilty: I think so.
Maiden: So be careful when touching it.
Guilty: Why not just pull out all the spikes...?
Maiden: Pull out what?"
island_adventure_fish_large_09_description,"Anis: ... Doesn't this name sound somewhat dangerous?
Maiden: Hmm... I guess so. How about we change it to Electric Ball?
Anis: How's that any less dangerous?"
island_adventure_fish_large_10_description,"Neon: It looks like an airship.
Maiden: Hmm? How do you know about airships?
Neon: Sometimes they appear at the Outpost.
Maiden: What? Really? No way!
Anis: You wouldn't know because you're playing games in your room 24/7."
island_adventure_fish_large_11_description,"Jackal: It's like melted ice cream!
Rosanna: Yeah, you're right.
Jackal: I'm giving it to you, Rosanna!
Rosanna: ... Is she trying to piss me off?
Maiden: Let's take it as a well-meaning gesture."
island_adventure_fish_large_12_description,"Viper: Oh my, it looks just like an umbrella! It would suit Sakura so well♡
Sakura: It would make a good accessory for you, with the poison and all.
Viper: ...
Maiden: ... Hah-hah, funny."
island_adventure_fish_large_13_description,"Maiden: It's blushing from shyness.
Anis: Why would it be shy?
Maiden: Maybe it feels humiliated by losing to me?
Anis: Well, it should feel shy about that."
island_adventure_fish_large_14_description,"Jackal: Viper! Look at this! It's ice cream! Heh-heh!
Viper: I'm warning you, don't eat it.
Jackal: Heh-heh! Okay! I'll give it to you! You eat it!
Viper: Uh...
Maiden: Oh dear, I feel like crying..."
island_adventure_fish_large_15_description,"Neon: It looks like a jellyfish, so what's up with its name?
Maiden: It's called Clams and Seaweed.
Neon: Wow! That's the most unfitting name I've ever heard!
Maiden: ..."
island_adventure_fish_large_16_description,"Maiden: ... Its head, torso, arms, and tail all seem like separate parts.
Neon: The sealed arms, sealed head, and sealed torso...
Maiden: ... It must be an invincible crayfish.
Neon: We should release it back into the sea."
island_adventure_fish_large_17_description,"Maiden: White with red and yellow spots... It's...
Anis: Oh, it's the Federation white...
Maiden: Hush!
Anis: Ah, my eyes! If you're going to cover my mouth, at least don't poke my eyes!
Maiden: S-sorry. But since it's just the main monitor that's damaged, everything should be fine, right?"
island_adventure_fish_large_18_description,"Rosanna: ... Its name is scary.
Maiden: Hmm? Why? Don't you think it's fitting?
Rosanna: Well, it's like giving a name like Pulverized Meat to someone who's been beaten up.
Maiden: ... Now that you mention it... yeah."
island_adventure_fish_large_19_description,"Sakura: This blue is pretty.
Rosanna: It's so scared that its face has turned blue.
Viper: Looks like a bruise.
Maiden: Everyone has such different opinions."
island_adventure_fish_large_20_description,"Maiden: Ta-da! I made some shrimp tempura.
Jackal: What's a shrimp tempura?
Maiden: Uh... It's deep-fried shrimp that's coated in flour.
Jackal: Won't it be the same if you eat shrimp and flour together?
Maiden: I don't think that's quite right..."
island_adventure_fish_large_21_description,"Anis: Wait... Did you really catch a whale while fishing?
Maiden: Absolutely.
Anis: No way! White-Bearded Whales are tens of meters long! You know that, right?
Maiden: Well, I did manage to reel one in, believe it or not."
island_adventure_fish_large_22_description,"Jackal: Hmm? An octopus with a hat!
Maiden: Jackal, it's a squid.
Jackal: A squid? What's that?
Maiden: Uh...
Maiden: It's... an octopus with a hat."
island_adventure_fish_large_23_description,"Maiden: Ah, I caught a Mecha Ocean Sunfish!
Anis: That's an unexploded ordnance...
Maiden: So this Mecha Ocean Sunfish has transformed its body into steel to live longer!
Anis: No, that's definitely an unexploded ordnance I tell you!"
island_adventure_fish_large_24_description,"Maiden: Did you know? Ocean Sunfish are thought to die easily, but that's actually not true.
Guilty: This one seems dead, though.
Maiden: Eh? S-surely not.

They said they fused Corruption with a substance called Vapaus, but those red eyes are a sign that it hasn't been cured yet.

Am I going to have to perform experiments on a living Nikke?

The more I think about this research, the more it unsettles me, but my superior has a frightening look on her face.
