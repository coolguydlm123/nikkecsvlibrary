m_ex_absolut_01_1,Ta-da!
m_ex_absolut_01_2,This is the chat room of Absolute!
m_ex_absolut_01_3,Woah!
m_ex_absolut_01_4,Was Commander added just now?
m_ex_absolut_01_5,Already in the group chat?
m_ex_absolut_01_6,Yup.
m_ex_absolut_01_7,"Oh, dear."
m_ex_absolut_01_8,They're really in here. T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_9,D:
m_ex_absolut_01_10,This idiot can join our chat?
m_ex_absolut_01_11,I'm gonna mute the notifications.
m_ex_absolut_01_12,Why add me to the group chat?
m_ex_absolut_01_13,Ah-
m_ex_absolut_01_14,Haha.
m_ex_absolut_01_15,Vesti said that...
m_ex_absolut_01_16,DM-ing you is too...
m_ex_absolut_01_17,embarrassing?
m_ex_absolut_01_18,So I decided...
m_ex_absolut_01_19,to be the middleman for you guys.
m_ex_absolut_01_20,Argh!
m_ex_absolut_01_21,How could you just say that up front T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_22,Vesti
m_ex_absolut_01_23,Eh?
m_ex_absolut_01_24,You can relax.
m_ex_absolut_01_25,Huh?
m_ex_absolut_01_26,Just think of me as your friend.
m_ex_absolut_01_27,Hahahaha.
m_ex_absolut_01_28,"Aww, our Vesti..."
m_ex_absolut_01_29,is so cute! Really!
m_ex_absolut_01_30,??
m_ex_absolut_01_31,Whaa! Look at Vesti's face!
m_ex_absolut_01_32,... She's beaming with joy.
m_ex_absolut_01_33,"Vesti, she..."
m_ex_absolut_01_34,took away my phone T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_35,Emma?
m_ex_absolut_01_36,Commander~ T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_37,I take back what I said. T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_38,I did not smile like that.
m_ex_absolut_01_39,Is it Vesti this time?
m_ex_absolut_01_40,Yep T_T
m_ex_absolut_01_41,In case Emma says anything weird in the group chat...
m_ex_absolut_01_42,Please don't take it seriously! OK?
m_ex_absolut_01_43,Why~
m_ex_absolut_01_44,What does it matter if I say anything weird ^_^!
m_ex_absolut_01_45,"Actually, Vesti said that"
m_ex_absolut_01_46,if only someone as gentle as Commander were to be my elder sibling...
m_ex_absolut_01_47,You're so annoying we 589u65^%$&
m_ex_absolut_01_48,... Seems like Emma's phone was taken away again.
m_ex_absolut_02_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_absolut_02_2,has anyone seen Eunhwa?
m_ex_absolut_02_3,Nope.
m_ex_absolut_02_4,Me neither T_T
m_ex_absolut_02_5,Hmm...
m_ex_absolut_02_6,What do I do?
m_ex_absolut_02_7,"I bought a bunch of clothes,"
m_ex_absolut_02_8,and thought this outfit would look perfect on her.
m_ex_absolut_02_9,"I really wanted her to try it on,"
m_ex_absolut_02_10,"but the second I got it out of the box,"
m_ex_absolut_02_11,she took off :'(
m_ex_absolut_02_12,Hmm...
m_ex_absolut_02_13,Maybe something came up
m_ex_absolut_02_14,and she had to take care of it?
m_ex_absolut_02_15,Maybe...
m_ex_absolut_02_16,Wait a sec.
m_ex_absolut_02_17,What?
m_ex_absolut_02_18,What kind of outfit is it?
m_ex_absolut_02_19,"Well, it's a women's clothing brand."
m_ex_absolut_02_20,I'm not sure
m_ex_absolut_02_21,if you've ever heard of it before.
m_ex_absolut_02_22,Would you morons
m_ex_absolut_02_23,cut it out?
m_ex_absolut_02_24,It's her!
m_ex_absolut_02_25,Eunhwa!
m_ex_absolut_02_26,What did the Boss say?
m_ex_absolut_02_27,Any new assignments?
m_ex_absolut_02_28,Tsk.
m_ex_absolut_02_29,"Are you messing with me,"
m_ex_absolut_02_30,or are you really that dimwitted?
m_ex_absolut_02_31,I'm being serious!
m_ex_absolut_02_32,I was just curious is all...
m_ex_absolut_02_33,A friendly reminder to everyone:
m_ex_absolut_02_34,"As we all previously agreed upon,"
m_ex_absolut_02_35,no fighting is allowed in the group chat where the Commander is in. ^_^;
m_ex_absolut_02_36,"Sorry, Commander :'("
m_ex_absolut_02_37,Can we try and get this train wreck back on track?
m_ex_absolut_02_38,"Anyway, what kind of outfit was it?"
m_ex_absolut_02_39,Fine by me!
m_ex_absolut_02_40,Back to the topic at hand...
m_ex_absolut_02_41,"Oh right, I nearly forgot!"
m_ex_absolut_02_42,Let me think...
m_ex_absolut_02_43,It'd make Eunhwa look like a magical fairy.
m_ex_absolut_02_44,Emma.
m_ex_absolut_02_45,I'm coming over.
m_ex_absolut_02_46,Stay where you are.
m_ex_absolut_02_47,Don't say another word
m_ex_absolut_02_48,until I get there. Please.
m_ex_absolut_02_49,"Whoa,"
m_ex_absolut_02_50,"did you see that, Commander?"
m_ex_absolut_02_51,"Eunhwa actually said ""Please."""
m_ex_absolut_02_52,Shut up.
m_ex_absolut_02_53,Why do I always get the brunt of it? :'(
m_ex_absolut_02_54,I'm very curious about what this outfit looks like.
m_ex_absolut_02_55,Did she say a fairy? Now I'm even more curious.
m_ex_absolut_02_56,Let me tell you something.
m_ex_absolut_02_57,"Pigs could fly, hell could freeze over..."
m_ex_absolut_02_58,and I still wouldn't let you see me in that outfit.
m_ex_absolut_02_59,"Hehe,"
m_ex_absolut_02_60,"don't take it to heart, Commander~"
m_ex_absolut_02_61,"She's just a little shy, that's all."
m_ex_absolut_02_62,"Don't worry,"
m_ex_absolut_02_63,I'll sneak a photo and show you so;kKLFJ)#!R)I!JF...SF>>
m_ex_absolut_02_64,... Seems that Eunhwa finally reached Emma's room.
m_ex_acpu_01_1,I have a question!
m_ex_acpu_01_2,No texting while on duty.
m_ex_acpu_01_3,Aren't you responsible for traffic direction today?
m_ex_acpu_01_4,Don't forget citizens are watching you!
m_ex_acpu_01_5,"Ah, texting is prohibited?!"
m_ex_acpu_01_6,"Yes, it is!"
m_ex_acpu_01_7,So how come you're texting right now?
m_ex_acpu_01_8,Cuz I'm not responsible for enforcing traffic today!
m_ex_acpu_01_9,I see!
m_ex_acpu_01_10,Emm...
m_ex_acpu_01_11,But
m_ex_acpu_01_12,No more texting!
m_ex_acpu_01_13,Sry
m_ex_acpu_01_14,but I have to say this!
m_ex_acpu_01_15,What's going on?
m_ex_acpu_01_16,"Well,"
m_ex_acpu_01_17,something is bothering me!
m_ex_acpu_01_18,What's that?
m_ex_acpu_01_19,Did you...
m_ex_acpu_01_20,... get into trouble again?
m_ex_acpu_01_21,"Did you do anything like lining civilians up on the road,"
m_ex_acpu_01_22,"or stand in the middle of the road, holding the traffic sign?"
m_ex_acpu_01_23,Noooo!!
m_ex_acpu_01_24,It's just that I lost my way.
m_ex_acpu_01_25,What?
m_ex_acpu_01_26,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_01_27,Where? And when?
m_ex_acpu_01_28,"I was supposed to be on duty in Ark Square,"
m_ex_acpu_01_29,and I suddenly realized there were unfamiliar buildings all around me!
m_ex_acpu_01_30,Aren't you a police officer?
m_ex_acpu_01_31,"Yup, I know!"
m_ex_acpu_01_32,So how could you get lost while on duty?
m_ex_acpu_01_33,That's what I wanna know.
m_ex_acpu_01_34,Ah.
m_ex_acpu_01_35,"I wanted to find a high-rise building,"
m_ex_acpu_01_36,... but I lost all my sense of direction on the way.
m_ex_acpu_01_37,I thought you're tasked with traffic enforcement today.
m_ex_acpu_01_38,Yep!
m_ex_acpu_01_39,"Then, why would you find a high-rise building?"
m_ex_acpu_01_40,A high-rise building offers a better view!
m_ex_acpu_01_41,Aha
m_ex_acpu_01_42,Got it.
m_ex_acpu_01_43,Miranda
m_ex_acpu_01_44,Eh?
m_ex_acpu_01_45,I will tell them you're performing a special task today.
m_ex_acpu_01_46,"So, find your way back by yourself, Okay?"
m_ex_acpu_01_47,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_01_48,"As a police officer, you shouldn't get lost!"
m_ex_acpu_01_49,Such a shame!
m_ex_acpu_01_50,I won't help you find the way back!!!
m_ex_acpu_01_51,How can I get back myself when I'm already lost?
m_ex_acpu_01_52,No idea!
m_ex_acpu_01_53,"Since you're so fond of tall buildings,"
m_ex_acpu_01_54,"go find one and use the nice view you love so much to find the right way, woof!"
m_ex_acpu_01_55,!!!!!
m_ex_acpu_01_56,So that's how you do it!
m_ex_acpu_01_57,As expected of an experienced officer like Poli!!
m_ex_acpu_01_58,I'll go find the right way now!!!!
m_ex_acpu_01_59,Woah.
m_ex_acpu_01_60,Good luck.
m_ex_acpu_02_1,"Miranda,"
m_ex_acpu_02_2,"Miranda, where are you?"
m_ex_acpu_02_3,Reply to me!
m_ex_acpu_02_4,What's the matter?
m_ex_acpu_02_5,"We're responding to an emergency call, but we can't find Miranda."
m_ex_acpu_02_6,What happened?
m_ex_acpu_02_7,"Apparently, someone is running around"
m_ex_acpu_02_8,in the middle of the road shaking a chew toy
m_ex_acpu_02_9,trying to catch a stray dog.
m_ex_acpu_02_10,They're blocking traffic.
m_ex_acpu_02_11,Sorry for the late reply!
m_ex_acpu_02_12,You should be.
m_ex_acpu_02_13,Why aren't you at the police station?
m_ex_acpu_02_14,Didn't I tell you not to leave your post?
m_ex_acpu_02_15,What's the meaning of all this?!
m_ex_acpu_02_16,"Yikes, someone's a little upset..."
m_ex_acpu_02_17,"I had something to report to you,"
m_ex_acpu_02_18,but I couldn't find you. So I went out by myself.
m_ex_acpu_02_19,Do you not know how a phone works?
m_ex_acpu_02_20,You could have tried texting me!
m_ex_acpu_02_21,I thought I'd be back soon...
m_ex_acpu_02_22,"Sorry, next time I'll be sure to text you first before anything else."
m_ex_acpu_02_23,... Fine then.
m_ex_acpu_02_24,So where are you right now anyway?
m_ex_acpu_02_25,Right now?
m_ex_acpu_02_26,I'm on the road shaking this chew toy.
m_ex_acpu_02_27,???
m_ex_acpu_02_28,?!?!
m_ex_acpu_02_29,What?!
m_ex_acpu_02_30,You're the one we received a call about?!
m_ex_acpu_02_31,Guess so!
m_ex_acpu_02_32,Now that's something you don't see every day.
m_ex_acpu_02_33,What are you doing on the road?
m_ex_acpu_02_34,"I was watching the surveillance cameras, and a puppy caught my attention, so I went over right away."
m_ex_acpu_02_35,"Don't worry, Poli."
m_ex_acpu_02_36,I'll handle this!
m_ex_acpu_02_37,Stay right there and don't go anywhere!
m_ex_acpu_02_38,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_02_39,"I said stay there, and don't do anything!"
m_ex_acpu_02_40,Why?
m_ex_acpu_02_41,"If I leave this in Miranda's hands,"
m_ex_acpu_02_42,it'll take twice as long to break up this gridlock.
m_ex_acpu_02_43,Not to mention how many more issues she may end up causing...
m_ex_acpu_02_44,I need to intervene before things get any worse.
m_ex_acpu_02_45,I doubt she'll even be able to catch that dog on her own.
m_ex_acpu_02_46,I can definitely see that being the case.
m_ex_acpu_02_47,She's more of a hindrance than anything.
m_ex_acpu_02_48,"So, do you copy, Miranda?"
m_ex_acpu_02_49,Just wait there and don't do anything.
m_ex_acpu_02_50,So I kan't even shake the chew toy?
m_ex_acpu_02_51,"can't, sorry."
m_ex_acpu_02_52,That's right. Don't even shake it a little bit.
m_ex_acpu_02_53,Just stand at attention and don't move.
m_ex_acpu_02_54,"If people found out this traffic jam is all because of a police officer bumbling about, we'd never hear the end of it."
m_ex_acpu_02_55,"Yes, ma'am! I'll wait right here."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_1,Warning! Warning!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_2,What's wrong?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_3,Why are you talking so much all of a sudden?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_4,Lost some money?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_5,Boss
m_ex_cafesweety_01_6,called us.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_7,!!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_8,"Ah, what happened?"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_9,Why did the Boss suddenly ask us to gather?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_10,Explain.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_11,Troublesome.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_12,Give us the explanation first!!!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_13,Seriously.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_14,Why are you our leader!?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_15,Hmmm.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_16,Seems we need to keep asking her as usual.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_17,"Ah, so irritating!!"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_18,"If you guys are unsatisfied, why not be the leader yourselves?"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_19,"No way, Pal."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_20,I don't wanna trouble myself with such things.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_21,Me neither.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_22,Replace me.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_23,"Since you're already the leader, there's no turning back!"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_24,"If you really wanna quit, refund the money you spent on the sofa."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_25,The sofa was given to you only because you said you would like to be the leader.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_26,T_T
m_ex_cafesweety_01_27,I see.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_28,Did Boss want us to gather
m_ex_cafesweety_01_29,because we were reported for attacking Nikkes from other companies?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_30,You attacked Nikkes from other companies?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_31,Not exactly!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_32,We just made some mild threats against them.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_33,No.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_34,Although... a Central Government officer did mention something about a fine.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_35,When did that happen??
m_ex_cafesweety_01_36,A while ago...
m_ex_cafesweety_01_37,Shame on you! You didn't even tell us!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_38,"No, no."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_39,Then what is this about?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_40,"Hmph, no idea."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_41,I give up.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_42,"Ugh, forget it."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_43,We'll find the answer when we meet with the Boss.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_44,Seems to be about cosmetology.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_45,Seems about entertainment.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_46,!!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_47,"No, no, no."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_48,"Then, it's about cosmetology?"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_49,Yeeeeeees.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_50,Huh? Cosmetology?
m_ex_cafesweety_01_51,Geez! I don't wanna go.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_52,Just the idea of it annoys me already.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_53,Me neither.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_54,I'm not interested.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_55,Neither.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_56,You have to go.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_57,Huh???
m_ex_cafesweety_01_58,Why???
m_ex_cafesweety_01_59,How come!!!
m_ex_cafesweety_01_60,"Look, she was so annoyed that she even spoke more words. LMAO."
m_ex_cafesweety_01_61,Cuz you're the squad leader.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_62,"Ugh,"
m_ex_cafesweety_01_63,dammit.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_64,Hahahahahaha
m_ex_cafesweety_01_65,Good luck.
m_ex_cafesweety_01_66,Whatever.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_1,Bad news! Real bad news!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_2,What a disaster!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_3,What's wrong?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_4,The cafe made half as much as it did last month.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_5,"If things keep going like this, we'll be out on the street!"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_6,I made the same amount of money I always have...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_7,I made even more than usual.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_8,"Wait, what?"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_9,"So Sugar's earnings didn't change,"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_10,and Frima's actually increased?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_11,So that means I'm the only one who made less than before?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_12,Why????
m_ex_cafesweety_02_13,"Come to think of it, our customers haven't been ordering as many milk coffees as they used to."
m_ex_cafesweety_02_14,Why do you think that is?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_15,Um...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_16,"If I knew the answer to that,"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_17,would I be asking you guys??
m_ex_cafesweety_02_18,"What do you think, Partner?"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_19,The milk coffees haven't tasted the same lately.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_20,What?!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_21,What are you talking about?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_22,What does it taste like now?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_23,Can you be more specific?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_24,"Less aromatic, I'd say."
m_ex_cafesweety_02_25,But the aroma is what makes the latte so special.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_26,How can it be less aromatic?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_27,I use the vending machine to make every single milk coffee.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_28,I've got the recipe down to a science.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_29,How can it have changed?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_30,Could there be any other reason why
m_ex_cafesweety_02_31,milk coffee sales have gone down?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_32,"Maybe the recipe hasn't changed, but customers just want something different."
m_ex_cafesweety_02_33,Could that be it?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_34,Could it be the ingredients?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_35,Huh?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_36,Hmm...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_37,Like what?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_38,Any idea?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_39,Tell me!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_40,The
m_ex_cafesweety_02_41,supplier
m_ex_cafesweety_02_42,changed.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_43,?????
m_ex_cafesweety_02_44,When?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_45,Didn't we discuss this last time?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_46,Yes.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_47,Am I the only one in the dark here?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_48,When did our supplier change?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_49,Last month.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_50,They were cheaper than our old supplier.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_51,I thought Frima told you.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_52,"Well, since this is my first time hearing about it,"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_53,I'd say that's highly unlikely!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_54,"As I remember it, Frima asked us for our opinions"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_55,and we all agreed to it.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_56,Yes.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_57,...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_58,You two are clearly messing with me.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_59,No one ever asked my opinion about any of this.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_60,And now you're trying to throw me under the bus!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_61,You think you're better than me just because your earnings haven't gone down?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_62,Wait.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_63,Copy & Paste.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_64,11:09 Frima: Agreed?
m_ex_cafesweety_02_65,11:09 Sugar: I have no opinion.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_66,"11:09 Sugar: I did look up the new supplier though, and apparently their products are sweeter."
m_ex_cafesweety_02_67,"11:09 Sugar: Milk, what do you think?"
m_ex_cafesweety_02_68,"11:10 Milk: Whatever, stop bothering me."
m_ex_cafesweety_02_69,11:10 Milk: Do whatever you want.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_70,11:10 Frima: OK.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_71,Um...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_72,I don't remember any of that.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_73,No wonder this new supplier came so cheap... Their products taste awful!
m_ex_cafesweety_02_74,A sample was sent to us before we made our final decision.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_75,Mmhmm.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_76,...
m_ex_cafesweety_02_77,Fine.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_78,You got me.
m_ex_cafesweety_02_79,What else can I say?
m_ex_counters_01_1,Master
m_ex_counters_01_2,Um... Do you have running water
m_ex_counters_01_3,in your room?
m_ex_counters_01_4,Yes.
m_ex_counters_01_5,"Wow, so this is the only place where there's no water."
m_ex_counters_01_6,Can we even call this dump a dorm?
m_ex_counters_01_7,Take away the roof and it'd be no different from living on the street.
m_ex_counters_01_8,I want to take a bath.
m_ex_counters_01_9,"Me too, me too."
m_ex_counters_01_10,A nice hot bath.
m_ex_counters_01_11,"Me too, me too."
m_ex_counters_01_12,Take a bath.
m_ex_counters_01_13,Take a bath.
m_ex_counters_01_14,Take a bath!!!
m_ex_counters_01_15,Take a bath!!!!!!!!!
m_ex_counters_01_16,Takeeeeee—
m_ex_counters_01_17,A baaaathhhhhh—
m_ex_counters_01_18,Feel free to use my room as much as you like.
m_ex_counters_01_19,Wow.
m_ex_counters_01_20,Really?
m_ex_counters_01_21,No.
m_ex_counters_01_22,Yes.
m_ex_counters_01_23,Commander.
m_ex_counters_01_24,There must be a clear division
m_ex_counters_01_25,between the Commander's Room and the dorm.
m_ex_counters_01_26,"We know very well how much you care about us,"
m_ex_counters_01_27,but a lack of boundaries may result in a lap of discipline.
m_ex_counters_01_28,Lap of discipline.
m_ex_counters_01_29,Lap of discipline.
m_ex_counters_01_30,Lap of discipline.
m_ex_counters_01_31,I meant lack of discipline.
m_ex_counters_01_32,Lack of what?
m_ex_counters_01_33,"Please tell me, Rapi."
m_ex_counters_01_34,"Commander,"
m_ex_counters_01_35,please make a decision.
m_ex_counters_01_36,Feel free to use the bathroom as you see fit.
m_ex_counters_01_37,I couldn't ask for a better
m_ex_counters_01_38,Master.
m_ex_counters_01_39,You truly are wise.
m_ex_counters_01_40,And so prescient as well!
m_ex_counters_01_41,Prescient?
m_ex_counters_01_42,Prescient... p... p...
m_ex_counters_01_43,Pistol!
m_ex_counters_01_44,Firepower!!!!
m_ex_counters_01_45,Hahaha
m_ex_counters_01_46,Hahahaha
m_ex_counters_01_47,Whatever you say.
m_ex_counters_01_48,I already warned you.
m_ex_counters_01_49,How about we all take a bath together? Hehehehe
m_ex_counters_01_50,Woo-hoo!!!!
m_ex_counters_01_51,I'm too busy now. I'm not going.
m_ex_counters_01_52,No one's replied.
m_ex_counters_01_53,It seems they have already gone to the Commander's Room.
m_ex_counters_01_54,I warned you.
m_ex_counters_01_55,I hope you don't come
m_ex_counters_01_56,to regret this...
m_ex_counters_02_1,Hehe
m_ex_counters_02_2,Hahahahaha
m_ex_counters_02_3,What are you so giggly for?
m_ex_counters_02_4,Did you find an unexpected fortune?
m_ex_counters_02_5,Way better than that.
m_ex_counters_02_6,I
m_ex_counters_02_7,got
m_ex_counters_02_8,a
m_ex_counters_02_9,gift.
m_ex_counters_02_10,Gift?
m_ex_counters_02_11,Who gave it to you?
m_ex_counters_02_12,Master did.
m_ex_counters_02_13,They said that I'm a hard-worker.
m_ex_counters_02_14,Then
m_ex_counters_02_15,they
m_ex_counters_02_16,gave
m_ex_counters_02_17,me
m_ex_counters_02_18,a
m_ex_counters_02_19,gift.
m_ex_counters_02_20,Would you cut it out?
m_ex_counters_02_21,You're not the only one.
m_ex_counters_02_22,Huh?
m_ex_counters_02_23,I got a gift as well.
m_ex_counters_02_24,Commander gave it to me when they greeted me.
m_ex_counters_02_25,Really?
m_ex_counters_02_26,Yep.
m_ex_counters_02_27,What's going on here?!
m_ex_counters_02_28,I thought I was special.
m_ex_counters_02_29,"Rapi, don't tell me you got one too?"
m_ex_counters_02_30,I did.
m_ex_counters_02_31,??
m_ex_counters_02_32,What did the Commander say?
m_ex_counters_02_33,They thanked me for all my help.
m_ex_counters_02_34,Oh.
m_ex_counters_02_35,"Aha, I got it!"
m_ex_counters_02_36,My eureka moment is coming!
m_ex_counters_02_37,Congrats.
m_ex_counters_02_38,The Commander definitely wants to build a harem.
m_ex_counters_02_39,You're wrong.
m_ex_counters_02_40,Then how come you gave all three of us gifts?
m_ex_counters_02_41,A three-way isn't enough for you?
m_ex_counters_02_42,"You want to throw another person into the mix, is that it?"
m_ex_counters_02_43,This is all a big misunderstanding.
m_ex_counters_02_44,That's right.
m_ex_counters_02_45,How could Master do that kind of thing?
m_ex_counters_02_46,"Even if they made eyes at all of us,"
m_ex_counters_02_47,it wouldn't be because
m_ex_counters_02_48,they had any ill intentions!
m_ex_counters_02_49,Certainly nothing like wanting a harem...
m_ex_counters_02_50,That's right.
m_ex_counters_02_51,"You're making way too much out of this, Anis."
m_ex_counters_02_52,Um...
m_ex_counters_02_53,"I was just kidding, hehe..."
m_ex_counters_02_54,You all need to loosen up!
m_ex_counters_02_55,"Sorry, Commander."
m_ex_counters_02_56,I'm just happy I was able to explain myself.
m_ex_counters_02_57,Yeah.
m_ex_counters_02_58,You shouldn't have had to defend yourself in the first place...
m_ex_counters_02_59,... I'd better not give any gifts to anyone for a while.
m_ex_exotic_01_1,Leader! Hehe.
m_ex_exotic_01_2,"I'm on my way back, just finished talking with an official of Heavenly Ascension."
m_ex_exotic_01_3,Official? Who?
m_ex_exotic_01_4,Did you forget the kid who just got promoted recently?
m_ex_exotic_01_5,Huh??
m_ex_exotic_01_6,You call that big guy a kid?
m_ex_exotic_01_7,"Hmph, you're annoying."
m_ex_exotic_01_8,Anyone younger than me is a kid :)
m_ex_exotic_01_9,"Anyway, haha,"
m_ex_exotic_01_10,I had an in-depth conversation with him.
m_ex_exotic_01_11,"He seems to be hostile to us,"
m_ex_exotic_01_12,"probably because we're not members of Heavenly Ascension,"
m_ex_exotic_01_13,and he probably resents us bossing him around.
m_ex_exotic_01_14,"Huh, is that so?"
m_ex_exotic_01_15,Seems like he still has more to learn.
m_ex_exotic_01_16,Don't you normally take care of such matters
m_ex_exotic_01_17,all by yourself?
m_ex_exotic_01_18,"Discussing this with us in the group chat,"
m_ex_exotic_01_19,you must have another plan.
m_ex_exotic_01_20,You're a true team leader.
m_ex_exotic_01_21,My point exactly.
m_ex_exotic_01_22,Honey♡
m_ex_exotic_01_23,"So you're pretty interested in our discussion, right?"
m_ex_exotic_01_24,Absolutely.
m_ex_exotic_01_25,I wouldn't say so.
m_ex_exotic_01_26,"Well, you've at least been following along :)"
m_ex_exotic_01_27,"As I said just now, that boy from Heavenly Ascension"
m_ex_exotic_01_28,ignores us and even wants to bully us.
m_ex_exotic_01_29,"As everyone knows, we, Nikkes,"
m_ex_exotic_01_30,can't inflict violence even if we want to due to restrictions.
m_ex_exotic_01_31,"However, if you, my dear,"
m_ex_exotic_01_32,submit a report
m_ex_exotic_01_33,"saying that he tried to hurt you,"
m_ex_exotic_01_34,then it's fine for us to teach this guy a lesson.
m_ex_exotic_01_35,Is this even legal?
m_ex_exotic_01_36,Of course!
m_ex_exotic_01_37,He's an outlaw.
m_ex_exotic_01_38,Even the Central Government doesn't treat them as humans.
m_ex_exotic_01_39,"As long as we can give a good reason,"
m_ex_exotic_01_40,"the Central Government will turn a blind eye on our little ruse, haha."
m_ex_exotic_01_41,"Anyway, just use the reason I mentioned."
m_ex_exotic_01_42,I'll leave it all up to you!
m_ex_exotic_02_1,"Leader,"
m_ex_exotic_02_2,do you remember that device you asked me to make?
m_ex_exotic_02_3,AKE 10.92.
m_ex_exotic_02_4,I buried it to keep it hidden.
m_ex_exotic_02_5,"I buried it nice and deep, so no dogs would be able to dig it up."
m_ex_exotic_02_6,Well? Did I do good?
m_ex_exotic_02_7,?
m_ex_exotic_02_8,?
m_ex_exotic_02_9,?
m_ex_exotic_02_10,Huh? What's with all the question marks?
m_ex_exotic_02_11,"Actually,"
m_ex_exotic_02_12,"come to think of it, what's the Commander doing in our chat room?"
m_ex_exotic_02_13,"Hey doofus,"
m_ex_exotic_02_14,it's because you're in the wrong chat room.
m_ex_exotic_02_15,Agh!
m_ex_exotic_02_16,Jackal left the group.
m_ex_exotic_02_17,Jackal has joined the group.
m_ex_exotic_02_18,What about now??
m_ex_exotic_02_19,Is the chat history cleared??
m_ex_exotic_02_20,Seriously...?
m_ex_exotic_02_21,What is it that you buried?
m_ex_exotic_02_22,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_exotic_02_23,Nothing special ;)
m_ex_exotic_02_24,It's a little time capsule
m_ex_exotic_02_25,"containing some of the memories between us, hehe."
m_ex_exotic_02_26,Yeah!
m_ex_exotic_02_27,You take all sorts of weird junk and stuff it in a can!
m_ex_exotic_02_28,Jackal.
m_ex_exotic_02_29,Shut up.
m_ex_exotic_02_30,"Yes, ma'am."
m_ex_exotic_02_31,What did you put in it?
m_ex_exotic_02_32,Time capsule?
m_ex_exotic_02_33,{AccountData.NickName}
m_ex_exotic_02_34,Your curiosity
m_ex_exotic_02_35,is going to get you in trouble one of these days.
m_ex_exotic_02_36,Can you not see what's going on here?
m_ex_exotic_02_37,Exactly!
m_ex_exotic_02_38,Don't you know it's inappropriate to pry into a girl's private affairs? :(
m_ex_exotic_02_39,"What, haven't you heard of a time capsule before?"
m_ex_exotic_02_40,"I took some items that remind me of you, put them in a container,"
m_ex_exotic_02_41,then buried them. It's a way to commemorate our time together.
m_ex_exotic_02_42,"You're a smartie pants, so I'm sure you already know this should be kept a secret, right? ;)"
m_ex_exotic_02_43,My lips are sealed.
m_ex_exotic_02_44,"You're the best, Honey!"
m_ex_exotic_02_45,Jackal.
m_ex_exotic_02_46,Find another spot to bury the capsule.
m_ex_exotic_02_47,Make it snappy.
m_ex_exotic_02_48,I'm on it!
m_ex_exotic_02_49,As for you...
m_ex_exotic_02_50,Yes?
m_ex_exotic_02_51,"Next time Jackal goes off on a tangent,"
m_ex_exotic_02_52,just ignore her.
m_ex_exotic_02_53,"If you encourage her, she'll end up doing it more than she already does."
m_ex_exotic_02_54,And I don't think any of us want that.
m_ex_exotic_02_55,I can't just ignore her.
m_ex_exotic_02_56,"Sorry for interrupting,"
m_ex_exotic_02_57,but some friends are expecting us.
m_ex_exotic_02_58,We really ought to get going.
m_ex_exotic_02_59,All right.
m_ex_exotic_02_60,Off we go then!
m_ex_exotic_02_61,"If you have any questions, just shoot me a message."
m_ex_external_01_1,Oh my... Something terrible happened.
m_ex_external_01_2,"Everyone, stop what you're doing and check the time."
m_ex_external_01_3,On it.
m_ex_external_01_4,You didn't notice anything unusual?
m_ex_external_01_5,"Nope,"
m_ex_external_01_6,cuz
m_ex_external_01_7,there's nothing unusual.
m_ex_external_01_8,Hehe... you mortals
m_ex_external_01_9,know nothing about the danger lurking behind the shadows.
m_ex_external_01_10,So naïve!
m_ex_external_01_11,So what exactly is wrong with the time?
m_ex_external_01_12,Did I miss something?
m_ex_external_01_13,Did you ask this question cuz you really don't know?
m_ex_external_01_14,Now is the time
m_ex_external_01_15,when people feel the least guilty
m_ex_external_01_16,and act the most cruel.
m_ex_external_01_17,Maiden left the group chat.
m_ex_external_01_18,"Oh, my partner."
m_ex_external_01_19,Add her to our group chat again.
m_ex_external_01_20,"Okay, I'll do it."
m_ex_external_01_21,As long as you promise not to bully Maiden anymore.
m_ex_external_01_22,Bully?
m_ex_external_01_23,I just told you guys the truth. That's all.
m_ex_external_01_24,"I won't add her back, then."
m_ex_external_01_25,Dammit... okay.
m_ex_external_01_26,I promise.
m_ex_external_01_27,Maiden joined the group chat.
m_ex_external_01_28,What nonsense are you gonna talk about this time?
m_ex_external_01_29,Sorry
m_ex_external_01_30,for not taking your mortality into consideration.
m_ex_external_01_31,Yup.
m_ex_external_01_32,"As you said,"
m_ex_external_01_33,you're not considerate at all.
m_ex_external_01_34,Dammit...
m_ex_external_01_35,So cruel!
m_ex_external_01_36,Right now it really is the time
m_ex_external_01_37,when people easily act cruel.
m_ex_external_01_38,Maiden left the group chat.
m_ex_external_01_40,"Uh oh, she left again."
m_ex_external_01_41,I know.
m_ex_external_01_42,Just let her be.
m_ex_external_01_43,"When the time comes,"
m_ex_external_01_44,the law of causation will guide her back to us.
m_ex_external_02_1,Huh...
m_ex_external_02_2,Wah... I can't take it anymore.
m_ex_external_02_3,How am I ever going to get over this?
m_ex_external_02_4,What happened?
m_ex_external_02_5,Maiden unfollowed me on Warbler.
m_ex_external_02_6,She knows too much
m_ex_external_02_7,about my true identity.
m_ex_external_02_8,She must be eliminated.
m_ex_external_02_9,Hey! Why do I have to die?
m_ex_external_02_10,Your posts are so bizarre
m_ex_external_02_11,"and off-putting,"
m_ex_external_02_12,that no sane person would follow you.
m_ex_external_02_13,What exactly does she post?
m_ex_external_02_14,"Guardian of Balance (@Darkmage) Warbled:
The moon tonight is exceptionally blood red.
Could that be why my blood is boiling?"
m_ex_external_02_15,What on earth possessed you to write this?
m_ex_external_02_16,"For a long time, there is no reply from Guillotine."
m_ex_external_02_17,If it weren't
m_ex_external_02_18,"for those posts on Warbler,"
m_ex_external_02_19,I wouldn't be able to control myself.
m_ex_external_02_20,Why not just write them down in a diary or something?
m_ex_external_02_21,That won't do.
m_ex_external_02_22,"If I want to contain myself,"
m_ex_external_02_23,I must have witnesses.
m_ex_external_02_24,"Fine, whatever."
m_ex_external_02_25,Then what about this one?
m_ex_external_02_26,"Guardian of Balance (@Darkmage) Warbled:
Sometimes, I contemplate ending it all.
But doing this would disrupt the balance of the world.
Such is the lonely fate of a life fettered by cosmic equilibrium..."
m_ex_external_02_27,Yikes.
m_ex_external_02_28,"I dunno, I think it sounds kinda cool."
m_ex_external_02_29,What's wrong
m_ex_external_02_30,with that post?
m_ex_external_02_31,I knew you had good taste.
m_ex_external_02_32,"As for you Maiden,"
m_ex_external_02_33,what's wrong with that post?
m_ex_external_02_34,I'm tired of bickering back-and-forth with you.
m_ex_external_02_35,Just let me ask you one thing.
m_ex_external_02_36,Don't balance and equilibrium
m_ex_external_02_37,mean the same thing?
m_ex_external_02_38,And why do you keep repeating them ad nauseam?
m_ex_external_02_39,It doesn't make any sense.
m_ex_external_02_40,"Once again, Guillotine doesn't reply for a long time."
m_ex_external_02_41,"What a fool you are, Maiden!"
m_ex_external_02_42,"The more you repeat your words, the more power they wield."
m_ex_external_02_43,"As a practitioner of the kotodama,"
m_ex_external_02_44,I'd think you of all people would understand that.
m_ex_external_02_45,"Also, if we're going to talk about disturbing others,"
m_ex_external_02_46,talk about the pot calling the kettle black!
m_ex_external_02_47,Every thirty minutes my phone is flooded
m_ex_external_02_48,with ads for some ridiculous new character in that game of yours.
m_ex_external_02_49,"Despite that, I was still nice enough to like every single one of your posts."
m_ex_external_02_50,"Also, you have a certain way with words as well:"
m_ex_external_02_51,"Black Rose (@BlackRose) Warbled:
OMG, you guys!
I have incredible news!
This new version comes with a new character, and what a total beefcake!
Hurry and snatch him up while you still can!"
m_ex_external_02_52,You seem to be awfully fond...
m_ex_external_02_53,Don't you dare say it...
m_ex_external_02_54,Guulotiin!!!!
m_ex_external_02_55,of repeating yourself as well!
m_ex_external_02_56,That's it.
m_ex_external_02_57,"You better shut your mouth, before I shut it for you."
m_ex_external_02_58,Don't forget that Commander is in the chat room as well.
m_ex_external_02_59,How could you speak like that?
m_ex_external_02_60,It doesn't matter...
m_ex_external_02_61,I think I'm a little out of my depth.
m_ex_external_02_62,And what is that ellipsis supposed to mean?
m_ex_external_02_63,I don't think you're actually okay with it.
m_ex_external_02_64,I knew it!
m_ex_external_02_65,Hehe...
m_ex_external_02_66,I wouldn't go that far.
m_ex_external_02_67,Partner has been around the block a few times.
m_ex_external_02_68,Fine!
m_ex_external_02_69,I surrender.
m_ex_external_02_70,What do you want me to do?
m_ex_external_02_71,"If it means you'll quit badgering me, then I'll do it."
m_ex_external_02_72,My request is simple:
m_ex_external_02_73,Follow me again on Warbler.
m_ex_external_02_74,Right.
m_ex_external_02_75,Now.
m_ex_external_02_76,Done.
m_ex_external_02_77,Satisfied?
m_ex_external_02_78,Great.
m_ex_external_02_79,I trust we won't have to go through this again in the future?
m_ex_external_02_80,Hehe... Hahaha!
m_ex_external_02_81,... Maiden has stopped reading her messages.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_1,Everyone!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_2,I have some bad news...
m_ex_infinityrail_01_3,All of my strawberry candy fell on the floor T_T
m_ex_infinityrail_01_4,Great.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_5,Great!!!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_6,Great?!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_7,Why! Do you guys hate strawberry candy that much?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_8,Not really.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_9,"It's just that sometimes we wanna try some other flavors, hee-hee."
m_ex_infinityrail_01_10,"You're such a meanie, Soline!"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_11,I could tell from your expression that you really enjoyed the strawberry candy.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_12,"But soon as you finish them, then you complain about wanting other flavors."
m_ex_infinityrail_01_13,That's not true!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_14,And Commander's so mean as well!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_15,"You told me you enjoyed strawberry candy,"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_16,"but now, you just put them away."
m_ex_infinityrail_01_17,It's not like that.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_18,Why hasn't Brid said anything?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_19,Indeed. Why's she so quiet today?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_20,"Brid, I summon you!"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_21,Reveal yourself!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_22,I—summon—you—
m_ex_infinityrail_01_23,I summon you
m_ex_infinityrail_01_24,I'm working.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_25,Summoning success! Hahaha.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_26,"Brid, what's your opinion?"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_27,All of our strawberry candy fell on the floor.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_28,Isn't it such a waste?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_29,Diesel
m_ex_infinityrail_01_30,Huh?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_31,I don't have a sweet tooth.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_32,So I've got nothing to say about this.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_33,Oh I see. I've never seen Brid eating candy.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_34,Then Brid gets a pass!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_35,You traitor!!!!
m_ex_infinityrail_01_36,"You two,"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_37,have been mucking around all day.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_38,Have you even finished your work for today?
m_ex_infinityrail_01_39,Ah.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_40,"I reckon, you must have."
m_ex_infinityrail_01_41,"In ten minutes,"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_42,I'll go check your work logs.
m_ex_infinityrail_01_43,"Ugh, Commander. Something else came up. I gotta go!"
m_ex_infinityrail_01_44,Me too! Excuse me!
m_ex_infinityrail_02_1,Having your own theme song would be great.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_2,You think so?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_3,Sure! How cool would it be if the AZX had its own theme song?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_4,It could play every time
m_ex_infinityrail_02_5,the train departs or arrives.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_6,"Brid, Soline, what do you think?"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_7,"Sorry, just saw your message."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_8,I think it's a good idea.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_9,Me too!
m_ex_infinityrail_02_10,Have you put any thought into the lyrics?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_11,I think it could go something like this:
m_ex_infinityrail_02_12,"Di Di Du Du~ All aboard the AZX, we're here for you!"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_13,"It's a little short, but what do you think?"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_14,Great.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_15,I think it's perfect as is.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_16,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_17,I think it's wonderful.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_18,We're here for you... I love it!
m_ex_infinityrail_02_19,I'm surprised you didn't include any lyrics about strawberry candy.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_20,"I wanted to, but couldn't find anywhere to fit it in."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_21,"Anyway, that settles the lyrics."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_22,Who should be the singer?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_23,Have you got anyone in mind?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_24,What about the Commander?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_25,I bet they're a great singer.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_26,Sounds good to me!
m_ex_infinityrail_02_27,"What do you say, Commander?"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_28,"I am so there, girlfriend."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_29,Music is my life.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_30,Lol.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_31,I like the confidence!
m_ex_infinityrail_02_32,"Though the Commander might be a good singer,"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_33,I was hoping we could find a soprano.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_34,"Hmm, then what about Soline?"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_35,"Me? No way, I hate singing!"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_36,"If you're thinking of asking me next,"
m_ex_infinityrail_02_37,the answer is no.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_38,"All right then, so be it."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_39,Guess it's time to throw my own hat in the ring.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_40,I've actually got a decent set of pipes on me.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_41,No one replies.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_42,Hello?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_43,Guys? :'(
m_ex_infinityrail_02_44,"Sorry, I'm so late with my replies, I'm working right now."
m_ex_infinityrail_02_45,I'll talk to you later.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_46,Um... I've gotta finish cleaning the AZX. Bye.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_47,I... also have something I need to do.
m_ex_infinityrail_02_48,Huh? How come everyone's so busy all of a sudden?
m_ex_infinityrail_02_49,Fine... we'll go over it later.
m_ex_inherit_01_1,{AccountData.NickName}
m_ex_inherit_01_2,Have you seen Isabel?
m_ex_inherit_01_3,A Commander here is looking for her.
m_ex_inherit_01_4,We haven't heard from her for several days.
m_ex_inherit_01_5,I haven't seen her either.
m_ex_inherit_01_6,Is that so?
m_ex_inherit_01_7,Then forget about it.
m_ex_inherit_01_8,"If she shows up,"
m_ex_inherit_01_9,let me know.
m_ex_inherit_01_10,"Ah, also,"
m_ex_inherit_01_11,"if she responds here, that would be better."
m_ex_inherit_01_12,"Are you watching, Isabel?"
m_ex_inherit_01_13,It's impossible for her to answer lol
m_ex_inherit_01_14,She's probably sending dozens of messages
m_ex_inherit_01_15,to Imposter XD
m_ex_inherit_01_16,She really isn't.
m_ex_inherit_01_17,The answer is almost certain.
m_ex_inherit_01_18,Isabel must be nearby.
m_ex_inherit_01_19,"She is not sending messages to Imposter, only because she is right over there."
m_ex_inherit_01_20,Noah.
m_ex_inherit_01_21,You shouldn't have said that.
m_ex_inherit_01_22,Now the scaredy-cat probably went into hiding.
m_ex_inherit_01_23,"Ah, for real?"
m_ex_inherit_01_24,They're that scared? LMAO.
m_ex_inherit_01_25,There was a strange noise in my room.
m_ex_inherit_01_26,What kind of noise?
m_ex_inherit_01_27,Like someone's inside.
m_ex_inherit_01_28,Haha is that true?
m_ex_inherit_01_29,Go check it out.
m_ex_inherit_01_30,"No way, I'm scared."
m_ex_inherit_01_31,Okay.
m_ex_inherit_01_32,Just cut the crap and move!
m_ex_inherit_01_33,All right.
m_ex_inherit_01_34,How's it going?
m_ex_inherit_01_35,Is Isabel there?
m_ex_inherit_01_36,Ah?
m_ex_inherit_01_37,Eh?
m_ex_inherit_01_38,Hello hello?
m_ex_inherit_01_39,Why did you suddenly stop talking?
m_ex_inherit_01_40,Shut@#@% up%$Y?erws.
m_ex_inherit_01_41,What happened?
m_ex_inherit_01_42,Urghh... no idea.
m_ex_inherit_01_43,Stop talking to me.
m_ex_inherit_01_44,Huh?
m_ex_inherit_01_45,Don't talk to my honey.
m_ex_inherit_01_46,Eh?
m_ex_inherit_01_47,They're mine.
m_ex_inherit_01_48,Seems like it's not Imposter texting.
m_ex_inherit_01_49,"Is that you,"
m_ex_inherit_01_50,Isabel?
m_ex_inherit_01_51,It's rude
m_ex_inherit_01_52,to take away someone else's phone.
m_ex_inherit_01_53,Don't cause them any more trouble. Come back soon.
m_ex_inherit_01_54,No.
m_ex_inherit_01_55,"If you keep doing this, you'll get an earful from the Imposter."
m_ex_inherit_01_56,She's not answering.
m_ex_inherit_01_57,Is she doing something to Imposter?
m_ex_inherit_01_58,"Uh-oh, hahaha, she is really a weird one."
m_ex_inherit_02_1,Call and Response Game! 1!
m_ex_inherit_02_2,2!
m_ex_inherit_02_3,Don't respond.
m_ex_inherit_02_4,No one else responds.
m_ex_inherit_02_5,"Hey, what's with you guys?"
m_ex_inherit_02_6,How come the Imposter is the only one who responded?
m_ex_inherit_02_7,No one else responds either.
m_ex_inherit_02_8,"Hey, what's with you guys? How come nobody's responding?"
m_ex_inherit_02_9,I thought at least the Imposter would say something...
m_ex_inherit_02_10,Why single me out?
m_ex_inherit_02_11,What exactly is the purpose of this game?
m_ex_inherit_02_12,Call and response games don't have to mean anything!
m_ex_inherit_02_13,They're just designed to kill time.
m_ex_inherit_02_14,I'm busy.
m_ex_inherit_02_15,"Oh, ARE YOU?"
m_ex_inherit_02_16,I know for a fact you don't have any unfinished tasks at the moment.
m_ex_inherit_02_17,Tasks? My work is far too important to be associated with such a trivial word.
m_ex_inherit_02_18,"Sure, if you call hiding in the corner and peeping at the Imposter work!"
m_ex_inherit_02_19,"Noah, if you have nothing to do, why don't you help me concoct some potions?"
m_ex_inherit_02_20,"Thanks, but no thanks."
m_ex_inherit_02_21,You guys are so boring.
m_ex_inherit_02_22,I gotta go. Bye.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_1,Gym Rat
m_ex_lifetonic_01_2,Where are you?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_3,???
m_ex_lifetonic_01_4,What do you mean ???
m_ex_lifetonic_01_5,"You made an appointment to receive physical training today, remember?"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_6,I never made any appointment.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_7,Huh?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_8,How's that possible?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_9,"Well,"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_10,I might be mistaken.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_11,Sorry.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_12,But do you feel like exercising today?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_13,Why are we talking about this...
m_ex_lifetonic_01_14,Gym Rat
m_ex_lifetonic_01_15,"Rome wasn't built in a day, you know."
m_ex_lifetonic_01_16,"Each time you miss a workout,"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_17,your body shape becomes less perfect.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_18,"There she goes again,"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_19,trying to persuade other people to exercise.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_20,"Eh, Epinel?"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_21,Why are you online?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_22,?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_23,Didn't you say that
m_ex_lifetonic_01_24,you would be practicing
m_ex_lifetonic_01_25,for your public performance
m_ex_lifetonic_01_26,and that's why you couldn't exercise?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_27,Uh?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_28,Uhh?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_29,I'm practicing!
m_ex_lifetonic_01_30,Epinel?!
m_ex_lifetonic_01_31,Wait.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_32,Good luck.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_33,Bye.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_34,You traitor!
m_ex_lifetonic_01_35,"Gym Rat,"
m_ex_lifetonic_01_36,do you want to skip training as well?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_37,I don't feel like going to the gym.
m_ex_lifetonic_01_38,For real?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_39,Seriously?
m_ex_lifetonic_01_40,How could you treat me like this :(
m_ex_lifetonic_01_41,"Fine, I'll go."
m_ex_lifetonic_01_42,"See you then, hee-hee!"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_1,Phew! Another hot day!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_2,"At this rate,"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_3,"everyone will have to take nutritional supplements every morning, right?"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_4,I'm already taking them.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_5,Ew! I absolutely hate taking medicine.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_6,As expected of Coach! You're awesome!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_7,"Eh? Coach, this is not medicine."
m_ex_lifetonic_02_8,There's a biiiig difference between supplements and medicine!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_9,Why?
m_ex_lifetonic_02_10,Why do our squad members
m_ex_lifetonic_02_11,always like persuading others to do things?
m_ex_lifetonic_02_12,??
m_ex_lifetonic_02_13,I never persuade.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_14,"You're the one that's the most guilty of it, Rumani."
m_ex_lifetonic_02_15,???
m_ex_lifetonic_02_16,I don't get it.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_17,I just told you the truth.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_18,"Each time you skip a workout,"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_19,you lose something.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_20,A healthier body.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_21,A healthier mind.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_22,"You can't deny that, can you?"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_23,Eh? My thoughts exactly!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_24,Supplements make you healthy!!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_25,"You two are just two peas in a pod, you know?"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_26,I'm drained.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_27,!!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_28,"Epinel, are you exhausted?"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_29,Take some supplements!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_30,"Uh, actually, exercise can solve that problem!"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_31,Ah...
m_ex_lifetonic_02_32,I've had enough.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_33,I'm gonna mute the notifications.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_34,"Coach, do it with me!"
m_ex_lifetonic_02_35,Good idea.
m_ex_lifetonic_02_36,????
m_ex_lifetonic_02_37,Seriously?
m_ex_lifetonic_02_38,Coach!! You're going too far!!
m_ex_lifetonic_02_39,I ignore the group chat for a while.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_1,"Hey, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_2,You're starting to freak me out.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_3,Is something the matter?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_4,"Hey, be nice!"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_5,What's the matter?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_6,Something's happened!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_7,Something big!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_8,Really!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_9,Really!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_10,"She put me up to this, Old-Timer."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_11,!!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_12,"Hey Belorta,"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_13,"I can say that, right? ^^"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_14,No.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_15,!!!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_16,No?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_17,Uhh... did I screw it up? T_T
m_ex_littlecannon_01_18,...
m_ex_littlecannon_01_19,"After you said that, why would they care about what happened now?"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_20,Really?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_21,Are you really not curious at all?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_22,"No, I'm very curious."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_23,Great!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_24,That's fantastic!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_25,Hahahaha
m_ex_littlecannon_01_26,"Well, what is it?"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_27,Do you want to know?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_28,Do you reaaaalllly want to know?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_29,"If you do, then you need to repeat after us."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_30,Understand?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_31,"We will say the same thing, and then you repeat."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_32,Got it.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_33,We went up to the surface yesterday.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_34,We set off a super big...
m_ex_littlecannon_01_35,Super big!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_36,Super big?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_37,Suuuuppper beautiful...
m_ex_littlecannon_01_38,Super super beautiful...
m_ex_littlecannon_01_39,Super beautiful...
m_ex_littlecannon_01_40,Firecracker!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_41,Firecracker!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_42,Don't you do that all the time?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_43,"Sure, but the one we set off yesterday"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_44,was bigger than anything we'd made before.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_45,Much bigger!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_46,And much more beautiful!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_47,Want to see it?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_48,Want to see it?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_49,No.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_50,I want to see it.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_51,Huh?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_52,"Wait, that's not what we said..."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_53,Didn't you agree to repeat after us?!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_54,You went back on your word! How could you do that?!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_55,How could you do that?!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_56,I want to see it.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_57,You do? You want to see it?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_58,You're the best!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_59,Repeat after us!
m_ex_littlecannon_01_60,It's a deal.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_61,It's a deal.
m_ex_littlecannon_01_62,It's a deal?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_63,"Hehehe... all right, you don't have to repeat after us anymore."
m_ex_littlecannon_01_64,"So... you just want to show everyone the firecracker, is that it?"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_65,Yep! Hehehehe
m_ex_littlecannon_01_66,Isn't this game fun?
m_ex_littlecannon_01_67,"See you in a while, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_littlecannon_01_68,We'll go get the firecracker ready! XD
m_ex_littlecannon_02_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_2,Belorta put too much hot sauce in the crackers :'(
m_ex_littlecannon_02_3,It's just a harmless prank amongst friends.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_4,"Belorta, get Mica some cold water."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_5,I told her they were spicy crackers.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_6,But she didn't listen to me.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_7,"She's right, I didn't (⊙▂⊙ )"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_8,"Besides, Belorta just fetched me some"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_9,"ice water, and I'm feeling much better."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_10,My mouth still burns a little though...
m_ex_littlecannon_02_11,"Hehe, I'm gonna put twice as much hot sauce in next time!"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_12,What are you two up to?
m_ex_littlecannon_02_13,Making crackers!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_14,"They're super crispy,"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_15,and smell absolutely wonderful.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_16,"Yeah, and they're delicious!"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_17,"What's your favorite kind of cracker, Old-Timer?"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_18,Saltine crackers.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_19,Butter crackers.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_20,No kidding!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_21,We made some of those as well.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_22,You can have what's left!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_23,"Don't be shy,"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_24,there's plenty to go around.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_25,Yeah!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_26,"Hehe, hope they're tasty."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_27,I just hope there's nothing strange in them.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_28,What kind of gift would that be then?
m_ex_littlecannon_02_29,"Old-Timer, I'm afraid it's too late..."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_30,Belorta is already putting all sorts of weird toppings on the crackers.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_31,Hey!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_32,Don't be rude.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_33,This is how I show...
m_ex_littlecannon_02_34,affection♡
m_ex_littlecannon_02_35,"On second thoughts, I'm not hungry."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_36,"Aw, c'mon! We poured our heart and soul into these crackers."
m_ex_littlecannon_02_37,You're not even going to try a single one?
m_ex_littlecannon_02_38,"Yeah, we worked really hard on them!"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_39,"Just take a bite, pretty please?"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_40,:((((
m_ex_littlecannon_02_41,They're really delicious :'(
m_ex_littlecannon_02_42,Just don't do anything weird to them.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_43,"Okay okay, got it!"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_44,We'll only send you the best of the best.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_45,Hehehe...
m_ex_littlecannon_02_46,Your laughter sounds suspicious...
m_ex_littlecannon_02_47,Not at all! I'm being completely serious.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_48,Just wait until you get a load of these.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_49,You're gonna love 'em!
m_ex_littlecannon_02_50,Thank you.
m_ex_littlecannon_02_51,You're welcome ♡
m_ex_littlecannon_02_52,"Delicious crackers, coming right up!"
m_ex_littlecannon_02_53,Yeah! Coming right up!
m_ex_matis_01_1,I've got something to tell everyone.
m_ex_matis_01_2,Ooooh! What is it?
m_ex_matis_01_3,Don't interrupt me when I'm texting.
m_ex_matis_01_4,"Whoops, sorry!"
m_ex_matis_01_5,Maybe it has something to do with Cutey?
m_ex_matis_01_6,Maybe?
m_ex_matis_01_7,"Have no fear, the hero is here!!!!!!!"
m_ex_matis_01_8,Would you quit making such a racket?
m_ex_matis_01_9,Didn't I tell you not to use more than one exclamation point in your messages?
m_ex_matis_01_10,But they're how I assert dominance!
m_ex_matis_01_11,Can I at least use two?
m_ex_matis_01_12,"Fine, but no more."
m_ex_matis_01_13,Thanks!!
m_ex_matis_01_14,"Well, what did you have to share with us?!"
m_ex_matis_01_15,"If you quit interrupting me, I'll tell you!"
m_ex_matis_01_16,Okie dokie.
m_ex_matis_01_17,Congratulations are in order.
m_ex_matis_01_18,I have just completed development on
m_ex_matis_01_19,the brand new My Cutey!
m_ex_matis_01_20,Congratulations.
m_ex_matis_01_21,Awesome!!
m_ex_matis_01_22,"Since you told me to, congratulations!"
m_ex_matis_01_23,Thank you all.
m_ex_matis_01_24,This is nice. It's been a long time since this chat was so lively.
m_ex_matis_01_25,"With this rare lively atmosphere,"
m_ex_matis_01_26,I take it you'll all participate in the testing?
m_ex_matis_01_27,Hehehehe
m_ex_matis_01_28,Count me out!
m_ex_matis_01_29,You're not weaseling your way out of this.
m_ex_matis_01_30,"Hey, why not?!"
m_ex_matis_01_31,"All right, fine..."
m_ex_matis_01_32,I'm a hero on a mission.
m_ex_matis_01_33,I don't have time.
m_ex_matis_01_34,Don't try and fool me! I know your schedule is wide open.
m_ex_matis_01_35,Aw man...
m_ex_matis_01_36,I should know better than to piss off Maxwell when she's conducting the test.
m_ex_matis_01_37,"All right, that makes two."
m_ex_matis_01_38,Cutey...
m_ex_matis_01_39,"you'll be joining us too, won't you?"
m_ex_matis_01_40,What will happen if I refuse?
m_ex_matis_01_41,Refuse?
m_ex_matis_01_42,"Why, nothing!"
m_ex_matis_01_43,I can't force you to do anything.
m_ex_matis_01_44,Then I refuse.
m_ex_matis_01_45,You do?
m_ex_matis_01_46,I see.
m_ex_matis_01_47,"Well, I should get started on the testing."
m_ex_matis_01_48,I can hold it inside the Commander's Room!
m_ex_matis_01_49,What was that?
m_ex_matis_01_50,...
m_ex_matis_01_51,"You said you didn't want to participate, right?"
m_ex_matis_01_52,But I need you.
m_ex_matis_01_53,So we have no choice but to go up there.
m_ex_matis_01_54,"Maxwell,"
m_ex_matis_01_55,that's hitting below the belt...
m_ex_matis_01_56,There's another way we can get them on our side.
m_ex_matis_01_57,How?
m_ex_matis_01_58,What are you thinking?
m_ex_matis_01_59,Well?
m_ex_matis_01_60,Say it.
m_ex_matis_01_61,Speak up!
m_ex_matis_01_62,Birdie!
m_ex_matis_01_63,"Wait for me, your savior is on the way!"
m_ex_matis_01_64,I'm heading to the Commander's Room!
m_ex_matis_01_65,Hahaha! Wait for us! We're on the way!
m_ex_matis_01_66,Hahahaha!
m_ex_matis_01_67,Hahahahahahaha!
m_ex_matis_01_68,I'll join the testing.
m_ex_matis_01_69,I figured you would.
m_ex_matis_01_70,We'll wait for you in the testing room.
m_ex_matis_02_1,"Have no fear, Laplace is here!"
m_ex_matis_02_2,"Run for your lives, Drake has arrived!"
m_ex_matis_02_3,Do you two ever shut up?
m_ex_matis_02_4,I'm trying to concentrate.
m_ex_matis_02_5,But we're only texting...
m_ex_matis_02_6,That doesn't make you any less irritating!
m_ex_matis_02_7,"Well, excuuuuuse me."
m_ex_matis_02_8,"Anyway, what brings you two here?"
m_ex_matis_02_9,Don't forget that I got here first!
m_ex_matis_02_10,Laplace is the one who followed me!
m_ex_matis_02_11,How about we see a movie together?
m_ex_matis_02_12,What kind of movie?
m_ex_matis_02_13,How about a superhero movie?
m_ex_matis_02_14,I heard a great new installment just came out.
m_ex_matis_02_15,I've gotta see if the hero in the film is cooler than me or not.
m_ex_matis_02_16,Not interested.
m_ex_matis_02_17,Any movies about scientists trying to save the world?
m_ex_matis_02_18,A superhero movie?
m_ex_matis_02_19,Who's the protagonist?
m_ex_matis_02_20,Are they a villain?
m_ex_matis_02_21,Of course not! The hero is always the main character in a superhero movie.
m_ex_matis_02_22,Hahaha!
m_ex_matis_02_23,Don't worry.
m_ex_matis_02_24,There's bound to be a villain as well.
m_ex_matis_02_25,What other characters show up?
m_ex_matis_02_26,Let's see... There's a mad scientist who is obsessed with his crazy experiments
m_ex_matis_02_27,and hell-bent on destroying the world.
m_ex_matis_02_28,Then there's another villain who's a real ignoramus!
m_ex_matis_02_29,The plot has to do with the main hero saving the world from these dastardly villains!
m_ex_matis_02_30,He wants to destroy the entire world?
m_ex_matis_02_31,"No thanks, I can't stand violent movies."
m_ex_matis_02_32,"Why is it that every time a scientist shows up in a movie,"
m_ex_matis_02_33,"they're insane, want to destroy the world, or both?"
m_ex_matis_02_34,Hahaha!
m_ex_matis_02_35,"C'mon guys, I can't go see the movie on my own!"
m_ex_matis_02_36,But the characters and the story sound so predictable.
m_ex_matis_02_37,"Sorry, not interested."
m_ex_matis_02_38,"Anyway,"
m_ex_matis_02_39,"I'll be off doing experiments,"
m_ex_matis_02_40,so I'll be incommunicado.
m_ex_matis_02_41,Hey!
m_ex_matis_02_42,How about you Drake? Care to join me?
m_ex_matis_02_43,A supervillain attempting to destroy the world?
m_ex_matis_02_44,Sounds kind of intense...
m_ex_matis_02_45,I'm afraid I can't join you.
m_ex_matis_02_46,Fine...
m_ex_matis_02_47,"What about you, Birdie?"
m_ex_matis_02_48,???
m_ex_matis_02_49,"Do me this favor, will you?"
m_ex_matis_02_50,"No, thanks."
m_ex_matis_02_51,"Turned down not once, not twice... but three times..."
m_ex_matis_02_52,This is quite the blow to my dignity...
m_ex_matis_02_53,"Fine then, I'll go see the movie by myself!"
m_ex_matis_02_54,Hahaha!
m_ex_matis_02_55,Hahaha!
m_ex_matis_02_56,"Why are you laughing, Drake?"
m_ex_matis_02_57,Are you laughing at me?
m_ex_matis_02_58,"No, it's just that your laughter is infectious."
m_ex_matis_02_59,Hahaha!
m_ex_matis_02_60,"Gotcha. Well, I'm gonna head to the theater. Bye."
m_ex_matis_03_1,Everybody ready?
m_ex_matis_03_2,Of course!
m_ex_matis_03_3,All right!
m_ex_matis_03_4,Let's do this!
m_ex_matis_03_5,We're the strongest squad in Missilis!
m_ex_matis_03_6,Unbeatable electronic power!
m_ex_matis_03_7,Who are we?
m_ex_matis_03_8,Ma!
m_ex_matis_03_9,Ma!
m_ex_matis_03_10,S!
m_ex_matis_03_11,Mamas? Interesting choice.
m_ex_matis_03_12,No! What do you guys think you're doing?
m_ex_matis_03_13,"Haven't we gone through this already? Laplace is supposed to say ""Ma,"""
m_ex_matis_03_14,"Drake says ""ti,"""
m_ex_matis_03_15,"and I say ""s."""
m_ex_matis_03_16,"Sorry, I forgot."
m_ex_matis_03_17,Let's start over.
m_ex_matis_03_18,We're the strongest squad in Missilis!
m_ex_matis_03_19,Unbeatable electronic power!
m_ex_matis_03_20,Who are we?
m_ex_matis_03_21,Ti!
m_ex_matis_03_22,Ma!
m_ex_matis_03_23,S!
m_ex_matis_03_24,Timas? Very cool.
m_ex_matis_03_25,"Hey, we've gotta say it in order!"
m_ex_matis_03_26,So finicky...
m_ex_matis_03_27,How can our teamwork be so bad?
m_ex_matis_03_28,I'm gonna put you guys through special training after this.
m_ex_matis_03_29,"All right, for the last time..."
m_ex_matis_03_30,Let's do this!
m_ex_matis_03_31,We're the strongest squad in Missilis!
m_ex_matis_03_32,Unbeatable electronic power!
m_ex_matis_03_33,Who are we?
m_ex_matis_03_34,Ma!
m_ex_matis_03_35,Ma!
m_ex_matis_03_36,Ti!
m_ex_matis_03_37,S!
m_ex_matis_03_38,Hey!
m_ex_matis_03_39,Doesn't Mamatis has a nice ring to it?
m_ex_matis_03_40,"You're killin' me, Birdie."
m_ex_matis_03_41,Are you in the Commander's Room?
m_ex_matis_03_42,Stay right there. I'm coming over.
m_ex_mightytools_01_1,I find it more difficolt
m_ex_mightytools_01_2,to underrstand those guys recently.
m_ex_mightytools_01_3,Why are they difficolt to underrstand?
m_ex_mightytools_01_4,"Hey, kid! Don't you dare laugjh at me!"
m_ex_mightytools_01_5,I had a hartd time wiping it clean.
m_ex_mightytools_01_6,Why did they-
m_ex_mightytools_01_7,mark the buiilding?!
m_ex_mightytools_01_8,Sooo diraty again!
m_ex_mightytools_01_9,Who did this? Who made the building dirty again?
m_ex_mightytools_01_10,Lemme clean it up!
m_ex_mightytools_01_11,Let's clean the other buildings latwer.
m_ex_mightytools_01_12,Have you taken a look around our workshop?
m_ex_mightytools_01_13,"I haven't today, not yet!"
m_ex_mightytools_01_14,Lemme go have a look!
m_ex_mightytools_01_15,You're gonna go check it out now?
m_ex_mightytools_01_16,I'm back!
m_ex_mightytools_01_17,There's no problem!
m_ex_mightytools_01_18,No problem?
m_ex_mightytools_01_19,"I mean, is there one?"
m_ex_mightytools_01_20,Can't you see there's a puddlle of wsater in front of the door?
m_ex_mightytools_01_21,Ah!
m_ex_mightytools_01_22,"You mean, a puddle of water?"
m_ex_mightytools_01_23,I noticed that.
m_ex_mightytools_01_24,Then why did you tell me there's no problem?
m_ex_mightytools_01_25,"Hmp, Centi!"
m_ex_mightytools_01_26,Did you plamn to play a game caslled mopping the floor?
m_ex_mightytools_01_27,That place is a complete mess. It needs proper cleaning.
m_ex_mightytools_01_28,"Unlika other Nikkes,"
m_ex_mightytools_01_29,"we're members of Mighty Tools, and thus, we should devellop a good habit of keeping evertything in order."
m_ex_mightytools_01_30,I didn't make that mess!
m_ex_mightytools_01_31,It's been like that since early morning!
m_ex_mightytools_01_32,I thought you made that mess!
m_ex_mightytools_01_33,The mess was not madwe by you?
m_ex_mightytools_01_34,Hmph.
m_ex_mightytools_01_35,I don't think Centi is a koiddo who likes telling lies.
m_ex_mightytools_01_36,"Then, did you make the mess, Greenhorn?"
m_ex_mightytools_01_37,Of course not.
m_ex_mightytools_01_38,Then who did?
m_ex_mightytools_01_39,I don't belive other Nikkes did thiss to us
m_ex_mightytools_01_40,releasuing their anger by trashing our workashop.
m_ex_mightytools_01_41,No idea!
m_ex_mightytools_01_42,Lemme check it again!
m_ex_mightytools_01_43,I'm back!
m_ex_mightytools_01_44,With some clues!
m_ex_mightytools_01_45,Whaat?
m_ex_mightytools_01_46,Did you find the footrprints of the culprit?
m_ex_mightytools_01_47,Yep! I noticed there were some footprints!
m_ex_mightytools_01_48,Whose!?
m_ex_mightytools_01_49,Volt!
m_ex_mightytools_01_50,Volt? ?
m_ex_mightytools_01_51,And I also found some bone-like toys!
m_ex_mightytools_01_52,I think they belong to Volt!
m_ex_mightytools_01_53,No wonder Volt's feett have been wet untikl now!
m_ex_mightytools_01_54,"Oh, Volt, it's you!!!"
m_ex_mightytools_01_55,I'm glad no one was falsely accused.
m_ex_mightytools_01_56,Yep! What sheer luck!
m_ex_mightytools_02_1,Liter! Boss! We got a complaint!
m_ex_mightytools_02_2,Complaint?
m_ex_mightytools_02_3,What complainnt？
m_ex_mightytools_02_4,Complainnt？
m_ex_mightytools_02_5,"That's rude, Greenhorn."
m_ex_mightytools_02_6,Say it agaain.
m_ex_mightytools_02_7,I wonder what kind of
m_ex_mightytools_02_8,complaint we got.
m_ex_mightytools_02_9,But I think I can
m_ex_mightytools_02_10,guess what it's for.
m_ex_mightytools_02_11,It must be a complaint about the construction noise.
m_ex_mightytools_02_12,It's not that!
m_ex_mightytools_02_13,It's not?
m_ex_mightytools_02_14,No.
m_ex_mightytools_02_15,Then what is it?
m_ex_mightytools_02_16,Tellll meeeeee!
m_ex_mightytools_02_17,"Fine, fine!"
m_ex_mightytools_02_18,Someone was at one of our construction sites
m_ex_mightytools_02_19,and ended up discovering some skeletal remains.
m_ex_mightytools_02_20,"Once we're finished here, we've got to go help identify who they possibly belong to."
m_ex_mightytools_02_21,Bones?!
m_ex_mightytools_02_22,I didn't see that coming.
m_ex_mightytools_02_23,I'm not quite sure how to react...
m_ex_mightytools_02_24,I didn't expect things to take such a morbid turn.
m_ex_mightytools_02_25,Huh?!
m_ex_mightytools_02_26,There are pictures!
m_ex_mightytools_02_27,These bones are much bigger than I imagined.
m_ex_mightytools_02_28,They look like human bones.
m_ex_mightytools_02_29,Human bones?
m_ex_mightytools_02_30,Yeah!
m_ex_mightytools_02_31,I have no idea how they could have gotten there.
m_ex_mightytools_02_32,"If that's the case, then we have to call the police for sure."
m_ex_mightytools_02_33,Myy thoughs exactly.
m_ex_mightytools_02_34,"All right then,"
m_ex_mightytools_02_35,"Centi,"
m_ex_mightytools_02_36,call the police at once.
m_ex_mightytools_02_37,Ah! Liter!
m_ex_mightytools_02_38,Wha t ?
m_ex_mightytools_02_39,I checked the photos again.
m_ex_mightytools_02_40,I think these bones... are actually Volt's treats.
m_ex_mightytools_02_41,What? But how?
m_ex_mightytools_02_42,"Actually, that would explain why I ran out of treats so quickly."
m_ex_mightytools_02_43,Volt must have knocked them over at the construction site when we were working there.
m_ex_mightytools_02_44,"Bad boy, Volt!"
m_ex_mightytools_02_45,No more bone-shaped treats for you!
m_ex_mightytools_02_46,At least they're not human bones.
m_ex_mightytools_02_47,Exactly!
m_ex_mightytools_02_48,Thank goodness!
m_ex_mmr_01_1,@Ether
m_ex_mmr_01_2,"On the last Thursday of this month,"
m_ex_mmr_01_3,there will be a conference on our latest findings.
m_ex_mmr_01_4,"We're due to receive subsidies from the Central Government,"
m_ex_mmr_01_5,and Missilis will be granting us additional funds as well.
m_ex_mmr_01_6,Make sure you are prepared.
m_ex_mmr_01_7,OK.
m_ex_mmr_01_8,"An entire conference dedicated to the institute, very impressive."
m_ex_mmr_01_9,Hardly.
m_ex_mmr_01_10,We're simply
m_ex_mmr_01_11,reporting back to our superiors.
m_ex_mmr_01_12,Can I join?
m_ex_mmr_01_13,Sure :)
m_ex_mmr_01_14,"If you're willing to be a test subject for my human-Rapture defect research,"
m_ex_mmr_01_15,I could bring you up as a model example at the conference.
m_ex_mmr_01_16,No thanks.
m_ex_mmr_01_17,Hee-hee.
m_ex_mmr_01_18,There is still some time before the conference.
m_ex_mmr_01_19,Think about it :)
m_ex_mmr_01_20,No thanks.
m_ex_mmr_01_21,@Ether
m_ex_mmr_01_22,Syuen dropped off an unknown substance just now.
m_ex_mmr_01_23,She asked me to examine it at once.
m_ex_mmr_01_24,"However, it's not in line with my research field,"
m_ex_mmr_01_25,so I've passed it along to your division.
m_ex_mmr_01_26,OK.
m_ex_mmr_01_27,Syuen?
m_ex_mmr_01_28,Unknown substance?
m_ex_mmr_01_29,Yeah.
m_ex_mmr_01_30,She's always tossing things in here and leaving without a care in the world.
m_ex_mmr_01_31,Usually things dug up on the surface.
m_ex_mmr_01_32,Sometimes they're Rapture parts.
m_ex_mmr_01_33,Sometimes they're man-made objects from the old times.
m_ex_mmr_01_34,"Anyway, what's the deadline?"
m_ex_mmr_01_35,They said they'd give us one week.
m_ex_mmr_01_36,"That may seem like plenty of time for Syuen,"
m_ex_mmr_01_37,"but the problem is, how does this coincide with our preparations for the conference?"
m_ex_mmr_01_38,Can we do it?
m_ex_mmr_01_39,"If not, we'll make it work anyway."
m_ex_mmr_01_40,You all work really hard.
m_ex_mmr_01_41,That's how we operate.
m_ex_mmr_01_42,Our superiors don't arrange work according to our schedule.
m_ex_mmr_01_43,"Is it not the same with your boss, Andersen?"
m_ex_mmr_01_44,No comment.
m_ex_mmr_01_45,True.
m_ex_mmr_01_46,"You see, it's a universal problem."
m_ex_mmr_01_47,But our employees are all very capable.
m_ex_mmr_01_48,I'm sure we'll be able to go home by midnight :)
m_ex_mmr_01_49,@Ether
m_ex_mmr_01_50,?
m_ex_mmr_01_51,"Andersen, the Deputy Chief who the Commander mentioned just now."
m_ex_mmr_01_52,He asked for a copy of the survey materials covering M.M.R.'s new technology development status.
m_ex_mmr_01_53,"Stop, I don't want to hear it."
m_ex_mmr_01_54,The deadline is the day after tomorrow.
m_ex_mmr_01_55,I can't take this anymore.
m_ex_mmr_01_56,Make sure to have it ready when he needs it.
m_ex_mmr_01_57,Is the printing room available?
m_ex_mmr_01_58,The printing room?
m_ex_mmr_01_59,Yes.
m_ex_mmr_01_60,I'm considering writing my resignation letter and opening my own research institute :)
m_ex_mmr_01_61,Don't even think about it!
m_ex_mmr_01_62,Why not?
m_ex_mmr_01_63,"If you leave, I'll have to do all your work."
m_ex_mmr_01_64,Hahaha...
m_ex_mmr_02_1,"No. 7, commuters always have the same thing placed in their breast pockets."
m_ex_mmr_02_2,Do you know what it is?
m_ex_mmr_02_3,A scalpel?
m_ex_mmr_02_4,A gun?
m_ex_mmr_02_5,"No, but I like the way you think!"
m_ex_mmr_02_6,That's something we have on us at all times regardless.
m_ex_mmr_02_7,"Mana, any guesses?"
m_ex_mmr_02_8,Mana doesn't reply.
m_ex_mmr_02_9,Seems like you're quite busy :)
m_ex_mmr_02_10,So what's the answer?
m_ex_mmr_02_11,You really want to know?
m_ex_mmr_02_12,A resignation letter.
m_ex_mmr_02_13,@Ether
m_ex_mmr_02_14,We've been assigned to develop a new type of medicine.
m_ex_mmr_02_15,I'll need the report typed up before the night is out.
m_ex_mmr_02_16,Mana...
m_ex_mmr_02_17,Is it too late for me to turn in my resignation letter? :)
m_ex_mmr_02_18,Yup.
m_ex_mmr_02_19,Commander.
m_ex_mmr_02_20,I've made up my mind.
m_ex_mmr_02_21,"Since I'm not allowed to resign today,"
m_ex_mmr_02_22,can I just use my gun to wipe out
m_ex_mmr_02_23,anyone that gets on my nerves?
m_ex_mmr_02_24,"Or even better, I could poison them with that new medicine!"
m_ex_mmr_02_25,Just hang in there a little longer.
m_ex_mmr_02_26,Good luck with that.
m_ex_mmr_02_27,There's no reply. It seems both of them are busy with their work.
m_ex_pioneer_01_1,"I must inquire,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_2,doth everyone still live?
m_ex_pioneer_01_3,"Should thy flame remain unsnuffed, send a dot."
m_ex_pioneer_01_4,.
m_ex_pioneer_01_5,Hmm...
m_ex_pioneer_01_6,And what of the others?
m_ex_pioneer_01_7,Do they reside in areas scant of signal?
m_ex_pioneer_01_8,"Forsooth, leaving a message is my only recourse."
m_ex_pioneer_01_9,"3.3km to the right of Unlimited base,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_10,"a Nikke squad, having fallen behind, hath been found."
m_ex_pioneer_01_11,I hath lost their trail due to the avalanche.
m_ex_pioneer_01_12,"To mine eyes, it doth seem they traversed some distance"
m_ex_pioneer_01_13,ensuing our separation.
m_ex_pioneer_01_14,"Should any of thee in thy peregrinations chance upon them,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_15,do as a lodestar would and bring them to the Unlimited base.
m_ex_pioneer_01_16,There has been no reply for some time...
m_ex_pioneer_01_17,I begin to worry about that Nikke squad.
m_ex_pioneer_01_18,I'll help rescue them.
m_ex_pioneer_01_19,"No. There's no need.
I'm passing through there soon.
I'll handle it."
m_ex_pioneer_01_20,Thank you.
m_ex_pioneer_01_21,There has been no reply from Snow White for a while...
m_ex_pioneer_01_22,"Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Just now, I found the Nikke squad Scarlet mentioned."
m_ex_pioneer_01_23,Did you really?
m_ex_pioneer_01_24,"Yep.
They were taking cover several kilometers away from the location reported.
Seems like they encountered Rapture groups several times during that period."
m_ex_pioneer_01_25,How are they doing?
m_ex_pioneer_01_26,"The three of them are all seriously injured.
One of them has severe wounds on her abdomen. 
The other two suffer from serious bleeding in the head."
m_ex_pioneer_01_27,Contact Unlimited.
m_ex_pioneer_01_28,Even Seraphim can't save them.
m_ex_pioneer_01_29,"Rapunzel,
I sent you the coordinates.
When you pass through here, please take care of them."
m_ex_pioneer_01_30,Wait a moment.
m_ex_pioneer_01_31,The group chat remains quiet for some time...
m_ex_pioneer_01_32,"Share the coordinates with us, and Counters and I will be there right away."
m_ex_pioneer_01_33,"Believer,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_34,it's all right.
m_ex_pioneer_01_35,I'm already beside them.
m_ex_pioneer_01_36,How are they doing?
m_ex_pioneer_01_37,"When I arrived, they'd already..."
m_ex_pioneer_01_38,"Now, I'm gonna offer a prayer for them."
m_ex_pioneer_01_39,"If you have anything to say,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_40,just leave it here.
m_ex_pioneer_01_41,I'm terribly sorry for not getting there on time.
m_ex_pioneer_01_42,May they rest in peace.
m_ex_pioneer_01_43,I think they've received your message.
m_ex_pioneer_01_44,This must be so hard for you.
m_ex_pioneer_01_45,"But there are tens of thousands of variables on the surface,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_46,"capable of causing innumerous tragedies,"
m_ex_pioneer_01_47,which are all out of our control.
m_ex_pioneer_01_48,We're lucky enough to witness their last moments.
m_ex_pioneer_01_49,That's how I feel.
m_ex_pioneer_01_50,... I get what you're saying.
m_ex_pioneer_01_51,"... I decide to turn off the instant messenger for a while,
and offer my condolences."
m_ex_pioneer_02_1,What a dismal evening.
m_ex_pioneer_02_2,"I'm sure you're already aware of this, 
but always drink in a safe place.
The alcohol you're drinking is incredibly strong.
It'll impair your judgment.
Please bear that in mind."
m_ex_pioneer_02_3,!!
m_ex_pioneer_02_4,Such swiftness in thy reply!
m_ex_pioneer_02_5,Most unexpected indeed!
m_ex_pioneer_02_6,That really was fast. Is someone else replying to your message for you?
m_ex_pioneer_02_7,"I saw your message, so I replied. What's so surprising about that?"
m_ex_pioneer_02_8,Because you hardly ever
m_ex_pioneer_02_9,reply to messages so soon.
m_ex_pioneer_02_10,But let's leave that aside for now. Is Scarlet drunk?
m_ex_pioneer_02_11,??
m_ex_pioneer_02_12,"What, perchance, led thine to such a supposition?"
m_ex_pioneer_02_13,Dost thou have a penchant for spying on me?
m_ex_pioneer_02_14,"Also, might thou wish to partake in a drink with me?"
m_ex_pioneer_02_15,?
m_ex_pioneer_02_16,Doesn't Scarlet usually drink around this time anyway?
m_ex_pioneer_02_17,"Change ""around this time"" to ""all the time"", and you'll be in the right ballpark."
m_ex_pioneer_02_18,"Well,"
m_ex_pioneer_02_19,thy gazes all pierce through me so easily.
m_ex_pioneer_02_20,This must surely act as a testament to our acquaintanceship.
m_ex_pioneer_02_21,Tis enough to make one shimmer with joy!
m_ex_pioneer_02_22,"One more bottle of sake, then!"
m_ex_pioneer_02_23,"If you want to keep drinking, you don't have to make excuses."
m_ex_pioneer_02_24,"Hehe, my good fellow, more and more ye"
m_ex_pioneer_02_25,doth taketh a liking to the telling of truths.
m_ex_pioneer_02_26,Would thou perchance be inclined to allow me to bequeath the art of Swordsmanship upon ye?
m_ex_pioneer_02_27,"No, thanks."
m_ex_pioneer_02_28,"Aye, tis a crying shame!"
m_ex_pioneer_02_29,"How about learning some prayers, then?"
m_ex_pioneer_02_30,A candle faintly glimmers in a dark church.
m_ex_pioneer_02_31,Two people pray alone... on their knees... hehehe
m_ex_pioneer_02_32,HAHAHA.
m_ex_pioneer_02_33,I prefer praying by myself.
m_ex_pioneer_02_34,"That's right. Don't force yourself to learn anything.
What you should learn is how to better make use of Nikkes to fight against the Raptures and how to survive.
If I had to suggest one more thing you could learn... it would be how to operate anti-ship rifles."
m_ex_pioneer_02_35,?
m_ex_pioneer_02_36,That's no mean feat!
m_ex_pioneer_02_37,"When you say ""learning,"""
m_ex_pioneer_02_38,I assume you mean becoming as proficient as yourself?
m_ex_pioneer_02_39,"?
But of course.
If I were to provide instruction, I would teach everything I know."
m_ex_pioneer_02_40,"Sorry, a little intense for me."
m_ex_pioneer_02_41,"Very well.
If you are not willing to learn, I will not force you to do so."
m_ex_pioneer_02_42,Hehe.
m_ex_pioneer_02_43,Looks like all of us got turned down.
m_ex_pioneer_02_44,Fair treatment for all! Hahaha.
m_ex_pioneer_02_45,"Come, join me."
m_ex_pioneer_02_46,Drink with me.
m_ex_pioneer_02_47,"No.
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later."
m_ex_pioneer_02_48,I must go pray.
m_ex_pioneer_02_49,Blessings be upon you. Until we meet again.
m_ex_pioneer_02_50,"My good fellow, won't the drink with me?"
m_ex_pioneer_02_51,"I can't play favorites, so I must refuse."
m_ex_pioneer_02_52,Alas!
m_ex_pioneer_02_53,A truly dismal evening if there ever was one!
m_ex_protocol_01_1,Exga.
m_ex_protocol_01_2,?
m_ex_protocol_01_3,Who is exga?
m_ex_protocol_01_4,Exia.
m_ex_protocol_01_5,Typo.
m_ex_protocol_01_6,Hahaha
m_ex_protocol_01_7,I want to check something on my phone.
m_ex_protocol_01_8,But I don't know how to cjklas...
m_ex_protocol_01_9,Ha!
m_ex_protocol_01_10,Looks like another typo lol.
m_ex_protocol_01_11,You shouldn't laugh at your friend.
m_ex_protocol_01_12,OK.
m_ex_protocol_01_13,"So, what do you want to check?"
m_ex_protocol_01_14,"The photo, I, took as evidence, five years ago,,,"
m_ex_protocol_01_15,"I can't, seem to, find it,,,"
m_ex_protocol_01_16,"Ah, OK."
m_ex_protocol_01_17,"First off, you should to go to your phone's gallery."
m_ex_protocol_01_18,There should be a slider off to the side. You can use that to scroll through the photos.
m_ex_protocol_01_19,Press and hold the slider to scroll up and down quickly.
m_ex_protocol_01_20,"Use the slider to scroll to the approximate time period,"
m_ex_protocol_01_21,then use your finger to scroll through more slowly.
m_ex_protocol_01_22,You should be able to find the photo you're looking for.
m_ex_protocol_01_23,Um... but...
m_ex_protocol_01_24,"I can't, see the, slider,,,"
m_ex_protocol_01_25,"It's tiny,"
m_ex_protocol_01_26,so it's easy to miss. Haha.
m_ex_protocol_01_27,"Usually, it's translucent, and you can find it at the bottom right of the screen."
m_ex_protocol_01_28,"C'mon, focus and try harder!"
m_ex_protocol_01_29,Have you found it?
m_ex_protocol_01_30,"Not, yet,,,"
m_ex_protocol_01_31,Stop replying and just keep searching for it. Haha.
m_ex_protocol_01_32,Found it yet?
m_ex_protocol_01_33,Doesn't seem like it.
m_ex_protocol_01_34,Take a screenshot and let me see.
m_ex_protocol_01_35,"How, do you, take a screenshot?"
m_ex_protocol_01_36,"Well, it depends on what kind of phone you're using."
m_ex_protocol_01_37,Which mobile phone are you using?
m_ex_protocol_01_38,"I, don't know..."
m_ex_protocol_01_39,Oh my.
m_ex_protocol_01_40,Be patient.
m_ex_protocol_01_41,Keep at it.
m_ex_protocol_01_42,"All right, all right."
m_ex_protocol_01_43,She really is helpless.
m_ex_protocol_01_44,I've got to hold her hand
m_ex_protocol_01_45,every step of the way.
m_ex_protocol_01_46,"All right, to find out the model, go into settings."
m_ex_protocol_01_47,General -> Information
m_ex_protocol_01_48,"However, some phones don't have a General Settings menu."
m_ex_protocol_01_49,"If yours doesn't, then just look at the information."
m_ex_protocol_01_50,"Exga, just, wait, wait for me, just a sec,,,"
m_ex_protocol_01_51,"Can't, find, settings..."
m_ex_protocol_01_52,Good grief!
m_ex_protocol_01_53,"Forget this, how about, I, just go to, a phone, store"
m_ex_protocol_01_54,"and ask, them how, do it...?"
m_ex_protocol_01_55,"No, no."
m_ex_protocol_01_56,You don't have to go to any phone store.
m_ex_protocol_01_57,Just download this.
m_ex_protocol_01_58,spyware.tpk
m_ex_protocol_01_59,Just tap it and accept.
m_ex_protocol_01_60,Spyware?
m_ex_protocol_01_61,Hacking software?
m_ex_protocol_01_62,Uh huh.
m_ex_protocol_01_63,"Even if she goes to the shop, she'll only badger me with more questions."
m_ex_protocol_01_64,It's easier this way.
m_ex_protocol_01_65,Not to mention me figuring it out for her is better for my mental health...
m_ex_protocol_01_66,You got this!
m_ex_protocol_02_1,Wason
m_ex_protocol_02_2,Wason?
m_ex_protocol_02_3,Watson.
m_ex_protocol_02_4,"I've learned, how to use, a cellphone."
m_ex_protocol_02_5,exiia
m_ex_protocol_02_6,"Exia taught me. Boywas, she strict."
m_ex_protocol_02_7,Very much so.
m_ex_protocol_02_8,However...
m_ex_protocol_02_9,I'd rather not remember that day.
m_ex_protocol_02_10,Good.
m_ex_protocol_02_11,You're a big girl now!
m_ex_protocol_02_12,I'm very much indebted to her.
m_ex_protocol_02_13,I don't know if I'd go that far.
m_ex_protocol_02_14,But she's certainly made some progress.
m_ex_protocol_02_15,"Anyway, my parcel, arrived today. I've waited, for several days."
m_ex_protocol_02_16,What parcel?
m_ex_protocol_02_17,"A detective, should, keep her phone a, secret."
m_ex_protocol_02_18,"So I bought, a phone case, specifically meant for, detecctives."
m_ex_protocol_02_19,exxia
m_ex_protocol_02_20,Exia
m_ex_protocol_02_21,Still a fair amount of typos...
m_ex_protocol_02_22,I don't know why she keeps getting my name wrong.
m_ex_protocol_02_23,"I also, bought one, for, exia"
m_ex_protocol_02_24,No thanks.
m_ex_protocol_02_25,You don't have to do that.
m_ex_protocol_02_26,I don't need a new phone.
m_ex_protocol_02_27,"It's a token, of my gratitude, for, you peaching"
m_ex_protocol_02_28,you peaching
m_ex_protocol_02_29,you teacking
m_ex_protocol_02_30,You really shouldn't laugh at your own friend.
m_ex_protocol_02_31,Fiiiine.
m_ex_protocol_02_32,"But mark my words, you're gonna be seeing that phone case in a second-hand store very soon."
m_ex_protocol_02_33,"Why, can't I take off,"
m_ex_protocol_02_34,"the original, phone case?"
m_ex_protocol_02_35,"Will, the phone, break, if I keep trying?"
m_ex_protocol_02_36,Is it a hard case?
m_ex_protocol_02_37,You've gotta really put your back into it.
m_ex_protocol_02_38,"I'll try, one more, time then."
m_ex_protocol_02_39,Don't wrench it too hard.
m_ex_protocol_02_40,"Otherwise, the screen might..."
m_ex_protocol_02_41,wait
m_ex_protocol_02_42,Wait?
m_ex_protocol_02_43,Wait... a...
m_ex_protocol_02_44,Whhhhoooaa... hooww... straaanggee...
m_ex_protocol_02_45,Caaaan't... tyyyppee...
m_ex_protocol_02_46,Thescreeeeen... suddeeenly...
m_ex_protocol_02_47,Guess I didn't warn her in time.
m_ex_protocol_02_48,???
m_ex_protocol_02_49,She must have cracked her phone screen.
m_ex_protocol_02_50,How did she manage that?
m_ex_protocol_02_51,If you press the screen too hard
m_ex_protocol_02_52,"when you're removing a hard case, it'll break."
m_ex_protocol_02_53,I've seen it happen before.
m_ex_protocol_02_54,Ex... ac... t... ly...
m_ex_protocol_02_55,Ca... n't ty... pe...
m_ex_protocol_02_56,"exxa, this... What, should, I do?"
m_ex_protocol_02_57,Just buy a new one.
m_ex_protocol_02_58,"It'll cost just as much, if not more, to repair it."
m_ex_protocol_02_59,You could also visit some second-hand stores.
m_ex_protocol_02_60,I'll go tr ito ut...
m_ex_protocol_02_61,Good luck
m_ex_protocol_02_62,Good luck
m_ex_protocol_02_63,Ok... ay
m_ex_scouting_01_1,"Hello, Commander."
m_ex_scouting_01_2,Have you eaten dinner?
m_ex_scouting_01_3,Who is this?
m_ex_scouting_01_4,"Signal, present and accounted for!"
m_ex_scouting_01_5,What's with that manner of speech?
m_ex_scouting_01_6,"Commander,"
m_ex_scouting_01_7,I am not the same Signal you knew before.
m_ex_scouting_01_8,I made up my mind.
m_ex_scouting_01_9,I am also a member of the Scouts!
m_ex_scouting_01_10,"From now on, I will be more proactive and more decisivr."
m_ex_scouting_01_11,"Ah, typo."
m_ex_scouting_01_12,"Hey, why can't I recall it?"
m_ex_scouting_01_13,"Wait, gotta sound like I'm in the military..."
m_ex_scouting_01_14,For what reason can these words not be recalled?
m_ex_scouting_01_15,I don't mean nuthin...
m_ex_scouting_01_16,Er...I would like to retract my previous statement.
m_ex_scouting_01_17,Signal.
m_ex_scouting_01_18,What are you doing?
m_ex_scouting_01_19,"A major incident has occurred, Delta."
m_ex_scouting_01_20,I dare not reveal any more than that.
m_ex_scouting_01_21,I await your orders.
m_ex_scouting_01_22,You don't have to force yourself
m_ex_scouting_01_23,to sound different than you do normally.
m_ex_scouting_01_24,No!
m_ex_scouting_01_25,I want to be just like Delta!
m_ex_scouting_01_26,Strong and decisive!
m_ex_scouting_01_27,Aggressive and a mind as sharp as a tack!
m_ex_scouting_01_28,Is the show you're watching about the Central Government by any chance?
m_ex_scouting_01_29,Yes!
m_ex_scouting_01_30,Are the main characters soldiers?
m_ex_scouting_01_31,Yes...
m_ex_scouting_01_32,Is the heroine very strong and decisive?
m_ex_scouting_01_33,How did you know?!
m_ex_scouting_01_34,Have you been watching it too?
m_ex_scouting_01_35,Just as I expected.
m_ex_scouting_01_36,"The finale was yesterday, wasn't it? Did you watch it?"
m_ex_scouting_01_37,"No, I was too busy working on a mission."
m_ex_scouting_01_38,I was gonna watch it today! They're gonna be re-airing it.
m_ex_scouting_01_39,The hero dies.
m_ex_scouting_01_40,What?!
m_ex_scouting_01_41,"The heroine becomes a Nikke, but remembers her past when the hero dies."
m_ex_scouting_01_42,"Aggghhh, stop!"
m_ex_scouting_01_43,Stooop!
m_ex_scouting_01_44,No spoilers!
m_ex_scouting_01_45,WAAAAAHHHHH!
m_ex_scouting_01_46,"How could you do this, Commander?!"
m_ex_scouting_01_47,Signal.
m_ex_scouting_01_48,Calm down.
m_ex_scouting_01_49,"Uh, uh...huh?"
m_ex_scouting_01_50,Now you're sounding
m_ex_scouting_01_51,like the Signal we all know.
m_ex_scouting_01_52,That's not important right now!
m_ex_scouting_01_53,I had the show spoiled!
m_ex_scouting_01_54,This is just awful!
m_ex_scouting_01_55,That wasn't a spoiler.
m_ex_scouting_01_56,"You're a big meanie, Commander!"
m_ex_scouting_01_57,I haven't even seen that show.
m_ex_scouting_01_58,???????
m_ex_scouting_01_59,I made it all up.
m_ex_scouting_01_60,That's...
m_ex_scouting_01_61,That's fantastic!
m_ex_scouting_01_62,What happened to sounding strong and decisive?
m_ex_scouting_01_63,That doesn't matter anymore.
m_ex_scouting_01_64,I...
m_ex_scouting_01_65,I need to watch the finale right away!
m_ex_scouting_01_66,That way I won't have it spoiled for real.
m_ex_scouting_02_1,"Hello, Commander."
m_ex_scouting_02_2,I have a suggestion I'd like to make.
m_ex_scouting_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_scouting_02_4,Signal has been binge-watching so many TV shows that she hasn't been getting much sleep.
m_ex_scouting_02_5,"HHey1, wait!"
m_ex_scouting_02_6,"I was hoping you could talk some sense into her, Commander."
m_ex_scouting_02_7,Sounds like you're quite worried about her.
m_ex_scouting_02_8,I'm more concerned about the negative impact it may have on her job performance.
m_ex_scouting_02_9,"If she continues staying up into all hours of the night, her performance is sure to suffer."
m_ex_scouting_02_10,This could lead to workplace accidents that would pose a danger to both you and me.
m_ex_scouting_02_11,"Delta, wait! Listen to me!"
m_ex_scouting_02_12,"Commander, it's not like that."
m_ex_scouting_02_13,Uh... um...
m_ex_scouting_02_14,Go on then.
m_ex_scouting_02_15,"Yes, I've been watching TV shows."
m_ex_scouting_02_16,"However, even when Delta has nothing else going on, I always end up watching TV by myself."
m_ex_scouting_02_17,So I decided to watch a military documentary.
m_ex_scouting_02_18,Quite the change of pace.
m_ex_scouting_02_19,"I thought it was really interesting, so I recommended it to Delta."
m_ex_scouting_02_20,"Although to be honest, I would have kept watching it even if it was dry as dirt. I mainly wanted to see it so I would have more to talk about with Delta."
m_ex_scouting_02_21,"Ugh, this is so embarrassing..."
m_ex_scouting_02_22,I wanted to watch it on my own so that I could show off what I'd learned. I wanted to play it off like I was some kind of military expert.
m_ex_scouting_02_23,"As it turns out, I was in front of the TV so often that I just made Delta worried about me."
m_ex_scouting_02_24,"So, I'm sorry."
m_ex_scouting_02_25,Ah...
m_ex_scouting_02_26,Why didn't you just invite me to watch it with you from the beginning?
m_ex_scouting_02_27,You'd watch it with me?
m_ex_scouting_02_28,Of course. I'm sure I could glean something useful from the documentary as well.
m_ex_scouting_02_29,"So, what about the suggestion you mentioned a minute ago?"
m_ex_scouting_02_30,"I'm sorry, Commander, I wasn't fully aware of the situation."
m_ex_scouting_02_31,I take back what I said.
m_ex_scouting_02_32,Great!
m_ex_scouting_02_33,"If you like, Delta, we can watch some of the documentaries in my room later!"
m_ex_scouting_02_34,Sure thing.
m_ex_seraphim_01_1,Commander
m_ex_seraphim_01_2,did you go to the hospital today?
m_ex_seraphim_01_3,Nope.
m_ex_seraphim_01_4,??
m_ex_seraphim_01_5,Is that so?
m_ex_seraphim_01_6,"How come I saw you at the hospital, then?"
m_ex_seraphim_01_7,"Oh, that. Hee-hee."
m_ex_seraphim_01_8,Isn't it because we miss Commander too much?
m_ex_seraphim_01_9,"That's true, aha."
m_ex_seraphim_01_10,"We miss you, Commander!!"
m_ex_seraphim_01_11,Thanks for your concern.
m_ex_seraphim_01_12,Pepper.
m_ex_seraphim_01_13,"Are there times,"
m_ex_seraphim_01_14,"when you wanna tie Commander up to a bed,"
m_ex_seraphim_01_15,and just examine them all day?
m_ex_seraphim_01_16,Nope! I never thought about that kind of thing!
m_ex_seraphim_01_17,That's so wrong!
m_ex_seraphim_01_18,That's a crime!
m_ex_seraphim_01_19,It sure is!
m_ex_seraphim_01_20,"However,"
m_ex_seraphim_01_21,why do I feel
m_ex_seraphim_01_22,"that is more like therapy, though?"
m_ex_seraphim_01_23,It's all because Commander always gets wounded. Hehe.
m_ex_seraphim_01_24,"What's worse, they're always leaving the hospital ahead of schedule"
m_ex_seraphim_01_25,for the sake of completing tasks. Hehe.
m_ex_seraphim_01_26,"They never considering other people's feelings, hehe."
m_ex_seraphim_01_27,Hehehe.
m_ex_seraphim_01_28,"Even so, you can't tie me up for a medical examination."
m_ex_seraphim_01_29,That's for sure.
m_ex_seraphim_01_30,You really think I'd do that?
m_ex_seraphim_01_31,"That's right, Commander."
m_ex_seraphim_01_32,Marry is not that kind of person.
m_ex_seraphim_01_33,"That's to say, Commander."
m_ex_seraphim_01_34,"Before I really tie you up to the bed,"
m_ex_seraphim_01_35,"you should come and take a comprehensive examination, understand?"
m_ex_seraphim_01_36,Got it.
m_ex_seraphim_01_37,Huh? Are you sure?
m_ex_seraphim_01_38,"Then, lemme make an appointment for you!"
m_ex_seraphim_01_39,Wait a sec.
m_ex_seraphim_01_40,"Good idea, hee-hee."
m_ex_seraphim_01_41,As expected from our Pepper. Always quick on her feet.
m_ex_seraphim_01_42,"Tee-hee, I'll take that as a compliment."
m_ex_seraphim_01_43,Hold on a sec!
m_ex_seraphim_01_44,"See you then, Commander!"
m_ex_seraphim_01_45,See you then!
m_ex_seraphim_02_1,"Commander, do you have a minute?"
m_ex_seraphim_02_2,Sure.
m_ex_seraphim_02_3,"Great, thanks!"
m_ex_seraphim_02_4,Yippee!
m_ex_seraphim_02_5,What can I do for you?
m_ex_seraphim_02_6,We want to prepare some gifts
m_ex_seraphim_02_7,for the children who will be staying at the hospital.
m_ex_seraphim_02_8,Any ideas as to what we should buy?
m_ex_seraphim_02_9,Something that kids would get a big kick out of.
m_ex_seraphim_02_10,Homemade cookies.
m_ex_seraphim_02_11,Picture books
m_ex_seraphim_02_12,I'm afraid cookies won't do. :'(
m_ex_seraphim_02_13,The children are on a strict diet because of their condition.
m_ex_seraphim_02_14,"Hey, we could send them picture books!"
m_ex_seraphim_02_15,Good idea.
m_ex_seraphim_02_16,That's a great idea!
m_ex_seraphim_02_17,They'll be bored stiff in the hospital.
m_ex_seraphim_02_18,"If they end up liking them, we could consider other things like putting on a show."
m_ex_seraphim_02_19,That would be wonderful!
m_ex_seraphim_02_20,"If we do end up putting on a show,"
m_ex_seraphim_02_21,"would you be able to lend us a hand, Commander?"
m_ex_seraphim_02_22,??
m_ex_seraphim_02_23,The children would be over the moon
m_ex_seraphim_02_24,if you were there!
m_ex_seraphim_02_25,I think so too :D
m_ex_seraphim_02_26,"Sure, I'll help out."
m_ex_seraphim_02_27,"Yippee! Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_seraphim_02_28,"With the commander, everthing is going smoothly."
m_ex_seraphim_02_29,We'll be in touch.
m_ex_seraphim_02_30,Thanks again!
m_ex_talentum_01_1,"Could everyone do me a favor, please?"
m_ex_talentum_01_2,"Before I tell you what it is, could you promise to hear me out? >.<"
m_ex_talentum_01_3,Seriously! Just this time T_T
m_ex_talentum_01_4,This is my lifelong wish ><
m_ex_talentum_01_5,"Heh, you crack me up."
m_ex_talentum_01_6,"Stop teasing us. If you must, flirt with those consumers."
m_ex_talentum_01_7,... Hmph.
m_ex_talentum_01_8,I knew it.
m_ex_talentum_01_9,You're so ruthless.
m_ex_talentum_01_10,"Sweetie, you will hear me out, right??"
m_ex_talentum_01_11,My lifelong wish!
m_ex_talentum_01_12,Certainly.
m_ex_talentum_01_13,No harm to listen.
m_ex_talentum_01_14,"Ah, here's the thing..."
m_ex_talentum_01_15,"This time, YVONNE is selling an authentic designer bag."
m_ex_talentum_01_16,Only 30 bags will be released from 3:00 PM tomorrow.
m_ex_talentum_01_17,And online booking is required. Lots of people want this bag so it becomes a rush.
m_ex_talentum_01_18,So I need you guys to place an order for me with your accounts.
m_ex_talentum_01_19,"I've asked many people for help,"
m_ex_talentum_01_20,but they all plan to buy one just for themselves. So I can only count on you guys.
m_ex_talentum_01_21,"So, Sweetie~"
m_ex_talentum_01_22,"Ugh, how can I put this?"
m_ex_talentum_01_23,Can't you just find an online shopping agent to do this for you?
m_ex_talentum_01_24,"Why bother us, and Rookie, with this trifle?"
m_ex_talentum_01_25,Maybe she wants to save more money for something else.
m_ex_talentum_01_26,...
m_ex_talentum_01_27,Yep.
m_ex_talentum_01_28,You're right.
m_ex_talentum_01_29,Is there something wrong with my idea?
m_ex_talentum_01_30,"I have the right to splurge myself with the money I earned, right?"
m_ex_talentum_01_31,You do.
m_ex_talentum_01_32,!!
m_ex_talentum_01_33,See!
m_ex_talentum_01_34,"You all saw that, right?"
m_ex_talentum_01_35,Sweetie's on my side.
m_ex_talentum_01_36,Why are you guys so heartless? T_T
m_ex_talentum_01_37,Do you really have no clue?
m_ex_talentum_01_38,You always ask us to help you
m_ex_talentum_01_39,with such things every week.
m_ex_talentum_01_40,Ooh...
m_ex_talentum_01_41,Is that my fault?
m_ex_talentum_01_42,That's because there are new arrivals every week.
m_ex_talentum_01_43,That's the fault of those luxury brands!!!
m_ex_talentum_01_44,Okay. Fine.
m_ex_talentum_01_45,We'll do it.
m_ex_talentum_01_46,We'll place an order for you one last time.
m_ex_talentum_01_47,Aw
m_ex_talentum_01_48,But the next time you ask us to do something like this in the group chat...
m_ex_talentum_01_49,Thanks a bunch ><!!!
m_ex_talentum_01_50,I love you guys soooo much.
m_ex_talentum_01_51,I'm serious.
m_ex_talentum_01_52,Did it hurt?
m_ex_talentum_01_53,When you fell out of heaven?
m_ex_talentum_01_54,Heh.
m_ex_talentum_01_55,Ew.
m_ex_talentum_02_1,Dolla.
m_ex_talentum_02_2,"I'd say you and I are good friends, right?"
m_ex_talentum_02_3,?
m_ex_talentum_02_4,What's this all of a sudden?
m_ex_talentum_02_5,Why are you talking like that?
m_ex_talentum_02_6,Do you need money or something?
m_ex_talentum_02_7,Hey!
m_ex_talentum_02_8,"That hurts, you know :("
m_ex_talentum_02_9,We have been squadmates for a while now.
m_ex_talentum_02_10,And you've helped me on so many different occasions.
m_ex_talentum_02_11,Get to the point.
m_ex_talentum_02_12,"And before you say it, I suggest you think carefully."
m_ex_talentum_02_13,Geez!
m_ex_talentum_02_14,You don't have to be so mean about it.
m_ex_talentum_02_15,I heard that you're going to take over a tableware company.
m_ex_talentum_02_16,How about letting me take it over?
m_ex_talentum_02_17,"After all, you've got fingers in every pie, not just tableware."
m_ex_talentum_02_18,Give me one good reason why I should let you in on this.
m_ex_talentum_02_19,"Yikes,"
m_ex_talentum_02_20,"things got real tense, real quick in here."
m_ex_talentum_02_21,Wonder who's gonna come out on top?
m_ex_talentum_02_22,Stop adding fuel to the fire.
m_ex_talentum_02_23,How exciting!
m_ex_talentum_02_24,All right then. First off...
m_ex_talentum_02_25,Do you remember that thingamajig your company wanted to develop before?
m_ex_talentum_02_26,"Let me run the tableware company,"
m_ex_talentum_02_27,"and we can cooperate on every single R&D project this year, including that one."
m_ex_talentum_02_28,I'll also do everything in my power to help out
m_ex_talentum_02_29,with that new generation of biotablets you'll be launching soon.
m_ex_talentum_02_30,"Promotional events, expo booths, you name it."
m_ex_talentum_02_31,Would you put up promos in all your chain stores?
m_ex_talentum_02_32,Of course! ;)
m_ex_talentum_02_33,"What did you think I'd do, just hold the event in one store?"
m_ex_talentum_02_34,"If I hadn't asked, I'm sure you'd have done just that."
m_ex_talentum_02_35,Will Missilis' products hit the market at the same time as our tablet?
m_ex_talentum_02_36,",:-|"
m_ex_talentum_02_37,:|
m_ex_talentum_02_38,:‑J
m_ex_talentum_02_39,This is getting good!
m_ex_talentum_02_40,Ohhh!
m_ex_talentum_02_41,Hmm...
m_ex_talentum_02_42,Do we have a deal?
m_ex_talentum_02_43,Not yet.
m_ex_talentum_02_44,I have one more condition.
m_ex_talentum_02_45,Name it...
m_ex_talentum_02_46,I'll be in charge of the shipping and handling
m_ex_talentum_02_47,for all our clients in the future.
m_ex_talentum_02_48,??
m_ex_talentum_02_49,"Oh, come on!"
m_ex_talentum_02_50,"Don't push your luck, little girl."
m_ex_talentum_02_51,"Hey, wait a sec!!"
m_ex_talentum_02_52,"You're telling me that all of us invested,"
m_ex_talentum_02_53,but the supplies were actually being delivered by Yan the entire time?! :O
m_ex_talentum_02_54,I've always wanted to be in charge of shipping.
m_ex_talentum_02_55,"Ladies,"
m_ex_talentum_02_56,"let's be rational, okay?"
m_ex_talentum_02_57,"That's rich,"
m_ex_talentum_02_58,coming from someone who was trying to edge us out
m_ex_talentum_02_59,and gain a monopoly from the very beginning.
m_ex_talentum_02_60,"Calm down, everyone."
m_ex_talentum_02_61,"Shut up, you fool."
m_ex_talentum_02_62,This has nothing to do with you.
m_ex_talentum_02_63,"Don't worry Sweetie, this isn't your fight!"
m_ex_talentum_02_64,Let's discuss this somewhere else
m_ex_talentum_02_65,where we won't be disturbed.
m_ex_talentum_02_66,Okay! ☆
m_ex_talentum_02_67,Good grief.
m_ex_talentum_02_68,You're driving me crazy.
m_ex_talentum_02_69,Why don't you take turns handling shipping?
m_ex_talentum_02_70,There's no reply from anyone...
m_ex_triangle_01_1,Who bought a cup of coffee
m_ex_triangle_01_2,and put it on my desk?
m_ex_triangle_01_3,??
m_ex_triangle_01_4,"Newbie, was it you?"
m_ex_triangle_01_5,Not me.
m_ex_triangle_01_6,"Of course, it couldn't be you."
m_ex_triangle_01_7,You didn't even come to the Central Government today.
m_ex_triangle_01_8,Exactly.
m_ex_triangle_01_9,Who bought the coffee?
m_ex_triangle_01_10,Privaty?
m_ex_triangle_01_11,I told you I don't drink coffee with milk.
m_ex_triangle_01_12,"Otherwise, I'll have an upset stomach."
m_ex_triangle_01_13,Why didn't you buy me a different blend of coffee?
m_ex_triangle_01_14,"Now, I don't know what to do with this. I can't drink it!"
m_ex_triangle_01_15,???
m_ex_triangle_01_16,It's not me!
m_ex_triangle_01_17,Then who?
m_ex_triangle_01_18,How should I know?
m_ex_triangle_01_19,You always treat others nicely without letting them know.
m_ex_triangle_01_20,"And you'd get angry if they found out, right?"
m_ex_triangle_01_21,"Seriously, it's not me!!"
m_ex_triangle_01_22,I NEVER did such a thing!!!
m_ex_triangle_01_23,See?
m_ex_triangle_01_24,There she goes again.
m_ex_triangle_01_25,It's really not me this time.
m_ex_triangle_01_26,Newbie.
m_ex_triangle_01_27,Who do you think it is?
m_ex_triangle_01_28,Privaty.
m_ex_triangle_01_29,"Well, I'm not sure."
m_ex_triangle_01_30,"Commander, even you don't believe me?"
m_ex_triangle_01_31,I really didn't buy that coffee.
m_ex_triangle_01_32,"You mean, the coffee on the desk of Yulha?"
m_ex_triangle_01_33,Ah.
m_ex_triangle_01_34,I remember.
m_ex_triangle_01_35,Papillon seemed to be around Yulha's desk just now.
m_ex_triangle_01_36,Dammit.
m_ex_triangle_01_37,It must be that scheming...
m_ex_triangle_01_38,"Dammit. I thought it was Privaty,"
m_ex_triangle_01_39,so I took a sip.
m_ex_triangle_01_40,Argh!!!
m_ex_triangle_01_41,Yulha.
m_ex_triangle_01_42,Don't you have anything to say to me?
m_ex_triangle_01_43,Emm.
m_ex_triangle_01_44,Sry.
m_ex_triangle_01_45,I can't feel the sincerity of your apology at all!
m_ex_triangle_01_46,"And, Commander, don't you have anything to say to me?"
m_ex_triangle_01_47,Me? Why?
m_ex_triangle_01_48,You didn't choose to believe me just now.
m_ex_triangle_01_49,I'm so sorry.
m_ex_triangle_01_50,Aaaah
m_ex_triangle_01_51,I feel so wronged!!!
m_ex_triangle_01_52,Privaty.
m_ex_triangle_01_53,What!
m_ex_triangle_01_54,Stop complaining in the group chat.
m_ex_triangle_01_55,Finish your work for today first.
m_ex_triangle_01_56,"Aaaah, Yulha!!!"
m_ex_triangle_02_1,"Hey, guys!"
m_ex_triangle_02_2,I heard there's a new shopping mall opening up on Royal Road.
m_ex_triangle_02_3,Want to go check it out sometime?
m_ex_triangle_02_4,Did you say shopping mall?
m_ex_triangle_02_5,Uh-huh!
m_ex_triangle_02_6,"If the Commander's going, then count me in."
m_ex_triangle_02_7,I'm good.
m_ex_triangle_02_8,Stood up again?!
m_ex_triangle_02_9,"Come on, I'm inviting you to come with me. Pleeeaaase?"
m_ex_triangle_02_10,"I'm busy, you two go without me."
m_ex_triangle_02_11,Hmph.
m_ex_triangle_02_12,I just saw you finishing up all the paperwork.
m_ex_triangle_02_13,You just want to go off on your own and get drunk.
m_ex_triangle_02_14,...
m_ex_triangle_02_15,Huh?
m_ex_triangle_02_16,What's with you guys? Don't you wanna have fun?
m_ex_triangle_02_17,What's wrong with going shopping every once in a while?
m_ex_triangle_02_18,"More importantly,"
m_ex_triangle_02_19,this could be
m_ex_triangle_02_20,a team-building exercise!
m_ex_triangle_02_21,"So when you think about it, we actually HAVE to go."
m_ex_triangle_02_22,Don't you think we've been lacking a sense of unity?
m_ex_triangle_02_23,I don't buy this team-building baloney for a second.
m_ex_triangle_02_24,You just want to go shopping.
m_ex_triangle_02_25,Not at all!
m_ex_triangle_02_26,I mean... I would like to go shopping...
m_ex_triangle_02_27,but that's not all I'm after!
m_ex_triangle_02_28,Liar.
m_ex_triangle_02_29,Liar.
m_ex_triangle_02_30,"Enough. If you wanna go, go by yourself."
m_ex_triangle_02_31,... But what about all that stuff I said about team building?
m_ex_triangle_02_32,Why don't you believe me?
m_ex_triangle_02_33,It's been ages since we all last hung out.
m_ex_triangle_02_34,That's why I suggested this whole shopping idea in the first place.
m_ex_triangle_02_35,You're all putting words in my mouth.
m_ex_triangle_02_36,I see.
m_ex_triangle_02_37,"In that case, I'll go with you."
m_ex_triangle_02_38,"I don't like crowded places,"
m_ex_triangle_02_39,but I'll go as long as Yulha and the Commander come too.
m_ex_triangle_02_40,"Fine, I'll go."
m_ex_triangle_02_41,"Newbie, when can we expect you?"
m_ex_triangle_02_42,Do I have to?
m_ex_triangle_02_43,This is a team-building exercise.
m_ex_triangle_02_44,What do you think?
m_ex_triangle_02_45,"Everyone has to attend, and you're no exception."
m_ex_triangle_02_46,"If you don't want to participate, perhaps you should leave our group chat."
m_ex_triangle_02_47,Guess I don't have much of a choice...
m_ex_triangle_02_48,What time should we head out?
m_ex_triangle_02_49,Now?
m_ex_triangle_02_50,What's the hurry?
m_ex_triangle_02_51,Let me finish reading this report first.
m_ex_triangle_02_52,"When I'm done, I'll let you know."
m_ex_triangle_02_53,"I'll talk to you later, Newbie."
m_ex_triangle_02_54,"Later, Commander."
m_ex_triangle_02_55,.
m_ex_triangle_02_56,.
m_ex_triangle_02_57,.
m_ex_triangle_02_58,"See ya soon, Commander!"
m_ex_triangle_02_59,See you.
m_ex_unlimited_01_1,Queen! Rabbity!
m_ex_unlimited_01_2,What is Ice Splendamin?
m_ex_unlimited_01_3,It's frozen Splendamin.
m_ex_unlimited_01_4,It's when you take snow that falls from the sky and roll it into a ball.
m_ex_unlimited_01_5,Splendamin? I don't know what that is.
m_ex_unlimited_01_6,So it's made of snow? Awesome!
m_ex_unlimited_01_7,Does it taste good?
m_ex_unlimited_01_8,"Delicious, and very sweet."
m_ex_unlimited_01_9,Can I taste some?
m_ex_unlimited_01_10,How about I buy you some now?
m_ex_unlimited_01_11,Now?
m_ex_unlimited_01_12,Really?
m_ex_unlimited_01_13,OK!! ^^
m_ex_unlimited_01_14,"Ludmilla, would you like some?"
m_ex_unlimited_01_15,"Queen, would you like some?"
m_ex_unlimited_01_16,?
m_ex_unlimited_01_17,??
m_ex_unlimited_01_18,???
m_ex_unlimited_01_19,She didn't reply. T_T
m_ex_unlimited_01_20,Did something happen???
m_ex_unlimited_01_21,Sorry about that.
m_ex_unlimited_01_22,I don't have any gloves.
m_ex_unlimited_01_23,!!
m_ex_unlimited_01_24,Is that going to be a problem?
m_ex_unlimited_01_25,I'm not sure.
m_ex_unlimited_01_26,It's just that..
m_ex_unlimited_01_27,I'm not sure when this communication will be cut o
m_ex_unlimited_01_28,Cut o?
m_ex_unlimited_01_29,Queen?
m_ex_unlimited_01_30,Did her hands work their magic already?
m_ex_unlimited_01_31,!!
m_ex_unlimited_01_32,Seems like it!
m_ex_unlimited_01_33,The Queen's connection went night-night!
m_ex_unlimited_01_34,Let's go see Ludmilla.
m_ex_unlimited_01_35,"Okay, I'll just"
m_ex_unlimited_01_36,Whoa!
m_ex_unlimited_01_37,She's already here!
m_ex_unlimited_01_38,"Oh, really."
m_ex_unlimited_01_39,Queen says
m_ex_unlimited_01_40,she wants to eat green tea-flavored Ice Splendamin.
m_ex_unlimited_01_41,^_^
m_ex_unlimited_01_42,We can do that.
m_ex_unlimited_01_43,"Wait a minute, Queen did say something just now."
m_ex_unlimited_01_44,"Servant,"
m_ex_unlimited_01_45,I'm looking forward to you finding delicious food
m_ex_unlimited_01_46,that will satisfy me.
m_ex_unlimited_01_47,She told me to pass that message along. ^_^
m_ex_unlimited_01_48,I'll do my best.
m_ex_unlimited_01_49,"Thanks, Rabbity!"
m_ex_unlimited_02_1,Servant.
m_ex_unlimited_02_2,Are you busy now?
m_ex_unlimited_02_3,Rabbity!
m_ex_unlimited_02_4,Are you busy now?
m_ex_unlimited_02_5,Nope.
m_ex_unlimited_02_6,Perfect timing then!
m_ex_unlimited_02_7,I thought you'd be busy.
m_ex_unlimited_02_8,"Yeah, totally!"
m_ex_unlimited_02_9,How's your signal?
m_ex_unlimited_02_10,"So far, so good."
m_ex_unlimited_02_11,It's been smooth sailing up to this point
m_ex_unlimited_02_12,thanks to these gloves.
m_ex_unlimited_02_13,This is the first time that
m_ex_unlimited_02_14,"I've chatted with you for longer than a few seconds, Queen!"
m_ex_unlimited_02_15,I'm so happy! Lol.
m_ex_unlimited_02_16,Me too.
m_ex_unlimited_02_17,Anything I can do for you?
m_ex_unlimited_02_18,Ludmilla and Alice take a while to reply.
m_ex_unlimited_02_19,"Hey, Rabbity!"
m_ex_unlimited_02_20,"Queen hadn't replied, so I went to her room to see what was going on."
m_ex_unlimited_02_21,She took off her gloves to make some tea.
m_ex_unlimited_02_22,So her CombiLink... is no longer with us :/
m_ex_unlimited_02_23,Her hand can do damage even when she's making tea?
m_ex_unlimited_02_24,I'm not 100% sure myself.
m_ex_unlimited_02_25,The Queen is wondering
m_ex_unlimited_02_26,which type of tea you prefer?
m_ex_unlimited_02_27,"Black tea,"
m_ex_unlimited_02_28,or green tea?
m_ex_unlimited_02_29,Black tea.
m_ex_unlimited_02_30,Green tea.
m_ex_unlimited_02_31,"Wow, I didn't expect that :O"
m_ex_unlimited_02_32,I thought you would prefer sweet tea!
m_ex_unlimited_02_33,What makes you ask?
m_ex_unlimited_02_34,Ah!
m_ex_unlimited_02_35,Queen wants to have afternoon tea :)
m_ex_unlimited_02_36,"But unfortunately, she is out of your favorite tea :'("
m_ex_unlimited_02_37,"Next time, then!"
m_ex_unlimited_02_38,"Servant,"
m_ex_unlimited_02_39,I hope you are not too disappointed.
m_ex_unlimited_02_40,Queen wanted me to tell you that.
m_ex_unlimited_02_41,I see.
m_ex_unlimited_02_42,I hope we can have afternoon tea together
m_ex_unlimited_02_43,sooner rather than later!
m_ex_unlimited_02_44,"Me, too."
m_ex_unlimited_02_45,^_^
m_ex_unlimited_03_1,Rabbity!
m_ex_unlimited_03_2,Can you get in touch with Nanook?
m_ex_unlimited_03_3,I've been trying to reach her for days now.
m_ex_unlimited_03_4,Maybe she's sleeping?
m_ex_unlimited_03_5,Could she have been eaten by a...?!
m_ex_unlimited_03_6,"If she was hibernating, she'd have told us beforehand."
m_ex_unlimited_03_7,I wouldn't worry. Nanook is way stronger than your average polar bear.
m_ex_unlimited_03_8,Alice.
m_ex_unlimited_03_9,Have you been able to reach Neve?
m_ex_unlimited_03_10,Afraid not.
m_ex_unlimited_03_11,"Where are you right now, Ludmilla?"
m_ex_unlimited_03_12,Queen went out to find Nanook.
m_ex_unlimited_03_13,Where could Nanook be? :/
m_ex_unlimited_03_14,Need my help?
m_ex_unlimited_03_15,No need.
m_ex_unlimited_03_16,I found her.
m_ex_unlimited_03_17,!!
m_ex_unlimited_03_18,Really?
m_ex_unlimited_03_19,That's great!
m_ex_unlimited_03_20,Where was she?
m_ex_unlimited_03_21,Ludmilla didn't reply.
m_ex_unlimited_03_22,What happened?
m_ex_unlimited_03_23,:'(
m_ex_unlimited_03_24,Did her ComLink break down?
m_ex_unlimited_03_25,Heya!
m_ex_unlimited_03_26,Sorry about that.
m_ex_unlimited_03_27,"I sent a message a while back saying that I was gonna sleep,"
m_ex_unlimited_03_28,"but apparently the signal was bad, and it never got sent."
m_ex_unlimited_03_29,Good grief...
m_ex_unlimited_03_30,Where's Ludmilla?
m_ex_unlimited_03_31,She's with me.
m_ex_unlimited_03_32,"Her ComLink crashed for some reason,"
m_ex_unlimited_03_33,and now she can't get it back up.
m_ex_unlimited_03_34,"I'd like to catch a few more Z's,"
m_ex_unlimited_03_35,"but since Ludmilla can't use her ComLink,"
m_ex_unlimited_03_36,I'd better head back with her.
m_ex_unlimited_03_37,"Okay, sounds good."
m_ex_unlimited_03_38,See you soon.
m_ex_unlimited_03_39,"Woohoo, they're on the way!"
m_ex_unlimited_03_40,We should get things ready for when they get here.
m_ex_unlimited_03_41,"I appreciate you being so concerned about them, Rabbity."
m_ex_unlimited_04_1,Rabbity!
m_ex_unlimited_04_2,Burly Bear!
m_ex_unlimited_04_3,??
m_ex_unlimited_04_4,"I swear, sometimes it feels like I've turned into an animal."
m_ex_unlimited_04_5,You mean you'll become a real rabbit one day?
m_ex_unlimited_04_6,You'd be so kawaaaaiiii!
m_ex_unlimited_04_7,That'd be fantastic if you turned into a real bear.
m_ex_unlimited_04_8,So soft and cuddly...
m_ex_unlimited_04_9,What is it this time?
m_ex_unlimited_04_10,Nanook and I want to make a cake.
m_ex_unlimited_04_11,Do you have any recommendations?
m_ex_unlimited_04_12,Chocolate cake.
m_ex_unlimited_04_13,Strawberry cake.
m_ex_unlimited_04_14,"Chocolate cake, a classic. Let's go for that, then."
m_ex_unlimited_04_15,Alrighty!
m_ex_unlimited_04_16,"Strawberry cake, huh? Sounds nice and refreshing."
m_ex_unlimited_04_17,Yeah!
m_ex_unlimited_04_18,"We'll make sure to leave some for you, Rabbity."
m_ex_unlimited_04_19,What's Ludmilla up to?
m_ex_unlimited_04_20,I'm making tea.
m_ex_unlimited_04_21,It smells great.
m_ex_unlimited_04_22,"We haven't seen each other for a while, so we'll be having afternoon tea together."
m_ex_unlimited_04_23,What kind of tea would you like?
m_ex_unlimited_04_24,Something aromatic.
m_ex_unlimited_04_25,"I want something sweet, like... milk tea!"
m_ex_unlimited_04_26,"Oolong tea for me, please."
m_ex_unlimited_04_27,"I'd like fruit tea, please."
m_ex_unlimited_04_28,Hmm?
m_ex_unlimited_04_29,"Are you coming, Servant?"
m_ex_unlimited_04_30,"Are you coming, Burly Bear?"
m_ex_unlimited_04_31,"Are you coming, Rabbity?"
m_ex_unlimited_04_32,"Sorry, but I'm a bit busy at the moment."
m_ex_unlimited_04_33,That's too bad.
m_ex_unlimited_04_34,We'll have to take a rain check.
m_ex_unlimited_04_35,Sure thing.
m_ex_unlimited_04_36,"We'll have that cake ready for you in a jiffy, Queen."
m_ex_unlimited_04_37,Although Nanook does seem kinda sleepy.
m_ex_unlimited_04_38,Very good.
m_ex_unlimited_04_39,I'll start preparing the tea.
m_ex_unlimited_04_40,Have fun ladies.
m_ex_wardress_01_1,Commander
m_ex_wardress_01_2,The elevator isn't working.
m_ex_wardress_01_3,Yuni and Mihara are stuck inside.
m_ex_wardress_01_4,Will the emergency button work?
m_ex_wardress_01_5,I don't know.
m_ex_wardress_01_6,Can I press it?
m_ex_wardress_01_7,Give it a try.
m_ex_wardress_01_8,No response.
m_ex_wardress_01_9,Guess it's kaput as well.
m_ex_wardress_01_10,It's so stifling in here.
m_ex_wardress_01_11,I can't see anything.
m_ex_wardress_01_12,And there's no one else here.
m_ex_wardress_01_13,"It won't fall, will it?"
m_ex_wardress_01_14,No.
m_ex_wardress_01_15,How long are we going to be stuck in here?
m_ex_wardress_01_16,"Commander, how long do you need to fix it?"
m_ex_wardress_01_17,Give me an hour.
m_ex_wardress_01_18,One hour.
m_ex_wardress_01_19,A whole hour?
m_ex_wardress_01_20,I'll try to be as fast as I can.
m_ex_wardress_01_21,Two people
m_ex_wardress_01_22,in such a confined space...
m_ex_wardress_01_23,One hour...
m_ex_wardress_01_24,Wait a moment.
m_ex_wardress_01_25,I like it.
m_ex_wardress_01_26,It's wonderful.
m_ex_wardress_01_27,??
m_ex_wardress_01_28,You can take your time.
m_ex_wardress_01_29,Don't worry.
m_ex_wardress_01_30,There's no rush.
m_ex_wardress_01_31,Take all the time you need.
m_ex_wardress_01_32,Yes.
m_ex_wardress_01_33,What are you two up to?
m_ex_wardress_01_34,We just
m_ex_wardress_01_35,want to have a little private time.
m_ex_wardress_01_36,Mihara and I haven't had any fun together recently.
m_ex_wardress_01_37,"Yeah, we want to enjoy ourselves."
m_ex_wardress_01_38,See you later.
m_ex_wardress_01_39,Oh yeah.
m_ex_wardress_01_40,Make sure to knock
m_ex_wardress_01_41,before you open the door.
m_ex_wardress_01_42,Got it?
m_ex_wardress_01_43,I'll take your silence as a yes :D
m_ex_wardress_01_44,... Looks like I can take my time repairing the elevator.
m_ex_wardress_02_1,Commander
m_ex_wardress_02_2,I want to buy a leash.
m_ex_wardress_02_3,What about a black leather one?
m_ex_wardress_02_4,Did you say... a leash?
m_ex_wardress_02_5,Yes.
m_ex_wardress_02_6,A leash.
m_ex_wardress_02_7,"Commander,"
m_ex_wardress_02_8,what kind of blindfold do you prefer?
m_ex_wardress_02_9,Would a leather one put you off?
m_ex_wardress_02_10,"This one also looks quite nice, such lovely white fabric..."
m_ex_wardress_02_11,Can you just slow down for a second?
m_ex_wardress_02_12,"Yan told me about a new shopping mall that I'd enjoy,"
m_ex_wardress_02_13,so I went there today to have a look.
m_ex_wardress_02_14,It's like I've died and gone to heaven!
m_ex_wardress_02_15,Yuni and I are on a shopping spree.
m_ex_wardress_02_16,But why are you asking me these questions?
m_ex_wardress_02_17,"Well,"
m_ex_wardress_02_18,we've already bought more than enough for ourselves.
m_ex_wardress_02_19,So we thought we should pick out something for you.
m_ex_wardress_02_20,"Mihara and I talked it over,"
m_ex_wardress_02_21,but we still don't know what you're into.
m_ex_wardress_02_22,So we figured we'd ask you a few questions.
m_ex_wardress_02_23,"No, please. Don't."
m_ex_wardress_02_24,"Oooh oooh, Commander!"
m_ex_wardress_02_25,There's something here called a Sticky Whip.
m_ex_wardress_02_26,It clings slightly to whatever spot you use it on.
m_ex_wardress_02_27,"Apparently, it is an experience unlike any other."
m_ex_wardress_02_28,What do you think?
m_ex_wardress_02_29,Awesome.
m_ex_wardress_02_30,Meh.
m_ex_wardress_02_31,I knew you'd love it!
m_ex_wardress_02_32,"Hmm, maybe we need to turn it up a notch."
m_ex_wardress_02_33,This electric whip could do the trick.
m_ex_wardress_02_34,"Commander, when are you going to come over?"
m_ex_wardress_02_35,"We have so much to discuss, and the whip could join us..."
m_ex_wardress_02_36,I've prepared plenty of other toys as well.
m_ex_wardress_02_37,Do you have time today?
m_ex_wardress_02_38,"Sorry, I'm busy today."
m_ex_wardress_02_39,Then...
m_ex_wardress_02_40,How about tomorrow?
m_ex_wardress_02_41,I'm busy tomorrow as well.
m_ex_wardress_02_42,Seems like you've got a lot on your plate.
m_ex_wardress_02_43,I guess I'll have to try it on Mihara first.
m_ex_wardress_02_44,Don't forget to contact us when you have time.
m_ex_wardress_02_45,"If we don't reply to your messages straight away,"
m_ex_wardress_02_46,it's because we're... preoccupied.
m_ex_wardress_02_47,"Have a nice day, Commander!"
m_ex_admi_01_1,"Hi, Commander,"
m_ex_admi_01_2,I'm Admi.
m_ex_admi_01_3,I'm your partner for this mission.
m_ex_admi_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_admi_01_5,Likewise.
m_ex_admi_01_6,I'll be staying at the Courthouse.
m_ex_admi_01_7,"If you need my help,"
m_ex_admi_01_8,come and find me anytime.
m_ex_admi_01_9,Okay.
m_ex_admi_01_10,Hmm...
m_ex_admi_01_11,What's wrong?
m_ex_admi_01_12,I'm wondering if it's okay to end the conversation so soon.
m_ex_admi_01_13,.
m_ex_admi_01_14,.
m_ex_admi_01_15,.
m_ex_admi_01_16,"Tell me Admi, what are some things you enjoy?"
m_ex_admi_01_17,Me?
m_ex_admi_01_18,I...
m_ex_admi_01_19,.
m_ex_admi_01_20,.
m_ex_admi_01_21,.
m_ex_admi_01_22,like kittens.
m_ex_admi_01_23,What about you?
m_ex_admi_01_24,I like kittens too.
m_ex_admi_01_25,Really?
m_ex_admi_01_26,I didn't
m_ex_admi_01_27,expect that.
m_ex_admi_01_28,Aren't they adorable?
m_ex_admi_01_29,Whenever I see them basking in the sun
m_ex_admi_01_30,"without a care in the world,"
m_ex_admi_01_31,I can't help but feel relaxed myself.
m_ex_admi_01_32,That's why I always carry some snacks with me wherever I go.
m_ex_admi_01_33,...
m_ex_admi_01_34,.
m_ex_admi_01_35,.
m_ex_admi_01_36,.
m_ex_admi_01_37,?
m_ex_admi_01_38,Sorry for being
m_ex_admi_01_39,so talkative.
m_ex_admi_01_40,That's okay. I totally agree with everything you've said.
m_ex_admi_01_41,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_admi_01_42,It's nice meeting someone
m_ex_admi_01_43,who has the same interests as you.
m_ex_admi_01_44,"Well, I should get to work."
m_ex_admi_01_45,"Nice chatting with you, Commander."
m_ex_admi_01_46,Same here.
m_ex_admi_01_47,Catch you later.
m_ex_admi_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_admi_02_2,are you busy?
m_ex_admi_02_3,Not at the moment.
m_ex_admi_02_4,I'm about to go to bed.
m_ex_admi_02_5,...
m_ex_admi_02_6,Can I talk to you
m_ex_admi_02_7,for a minute?
m_ex_admi_02_8,Certainly.
m_ex_admi_02_9,Thank you.
m_ex_admi_02_10,Oh...
m_ex_admi_02_11,sorry for disturbing you.
m_ex_admi_02_12,Good night.
m_ex_admi_02_13,What is it?
m_ex_admi_02_14,Um...
m_ex_admi_02_15,nothing important.
m_ex_admi_02_16,Just tell me.
m_ex_admi_02_17,"Actually, I'm taking a walk in the park by myself."
m_ex_admi_02_18,"I've had a lot on my mind recently, so I wanted to have an early night."
m_ex_admi_02_19,It's just that I can't seem to fall asleep.
m_ex_admi_02_20,even though I'm not physically tired at all.
m_ex_admi_02_21,"One of the inconveniences of having a mechanical body, I suppose."
m_ex_admi_02_22,Emotional exhaustion doesn't affect me physically.
m_ex_admi_02_23,So it can be a challenge trying to fall asleep naturally.
m_ex_admi_02_24,"Oh boy, I'm starting to ramble again..."
m_ex_admi_02_25,It's okay.
m_ex_admi_02_26,Do you mind
m_ex_admi_02_27,sharing some of your own stories?
m_ex_admi_02_28,There's no one else around in the park right now.
m_ex_admi_02_29,"I have an overactive imagination,"
m_ex_admi_02_30,so it may be good to fill my mind
m_ex_admi_02_31,with someone else's stories.
m_ex_admi_02_32,Today has been rough.
m_ex_admi_02_33,I processed many documents today.
m_ex_admi_02_34,I knew it.
m_ex_admi_02_35,You always seem so
m_ex_admi_02_36,focused on your work.
m_ex_admi_02_37,"You've already had a long day, so I feel bad for disturbing you."
m_ex_admi_02_38,"But after receiving your message,"
m_ex_admi_02_39,I won't do it aga...
m_ex_admi_02_40,it's as if all my fatigue has vanished.
m_ex_admi_02_41,Huh?
m_ex_admi_02_42,But I
m_ex_admi_02_43,haven't given any words of encouragement or anything.
m_ex_admi_02_44,You've been the one listening to me the entire time.
m_ex_admi_02_45,That means you trust me.
m_ex_admi_02_46,...
m_ex_admi_02_47,"That's true,"
m_ex_admi_02_48,but I didn't expect you to feel the same way...
m_ex_admi_02_49,I just...
m_ex_admi_02_50,.
m_ex_admi_02_51,.
m_ex_admi_02_52,.
m_ex_admi_02_53,"So, can I talk to you again in the future?"
m_ex_admi_02_54,"Every once in a while, that's all."
m_ex_admi_02_55,We can talk anytime.
m_ex_admi_02_56,Thank you.
m_ex_admi_02_57,"Uh oh, Yulha is coming."
m_ex_admi_02_58,She must be worried since I'm not in the dorm.
m_ex_admi_02_59,"I'd love to chat with you more, but"
m_ex_admi_02_60,I should head back with Yulha.
m_ex_admi_02_61,"If I text you while she's talking,"
m_ex_admi_02_62,she'll give me an earful.
m_ex_admi_02_63,Thank you for your time.
m_ex_admi_02_64,Catch you later.
m_ex_admi_02_65,Okay!
m_ex_admi_02_66,That's a deal!
m_ex_admi_03_1,...
m_ex_admi_03_2,.
m_ex_admi_03_3,.
m_ex_admi_03_4,.
m_ex_admi_03_5,"Commander,"
m_ex_admi_03_6,I...
m_ex_admi_03_7,Um...
m_ex_admi_03_8,What is it?
m_ex_admi_03_9,Oh...
m_ex_admi_03_10,nothing.
m_ex_admi_03_11,It's nothing.
m_ex_admi_03_12,????
m_ex_admi_03_13,I'm... um...
m_ex_admi_03_14,on a mission with Privaty and Yulha.
m_ex_admi_03_15,"We've hit a bit of a snag,"
m_ex_admi_03_16,so we're taking a break
m_ex_admi_03_17,and talking.
m_ex_admi_03_18,"Eventually, you came up."
m_ex_admi_03_19,Me?
m_ex_admi_03_20,"Yeah,"
m_ex_admi_03_21,we're talking about some of the stuff you have done with us.
m_ex_admi_03_22,Only good things though!
m_ex_admi_03_23,I hope you don't mind.
m_ex_admi_03_24,Not at all.
m_ex_admi_03_25,As long as you're not criticizing me.
m_ex_admi_03_26,That's a relief!
m_ex_admi_03_27,!!
m_ex_admi_03_28,We would never do that!
m_ex_admi_03_29,I'm just messing with you.
m_ex_admi_03_30,Oh...
m_ex_admi_03_31,thank goodness.
m_ex_admi_03_32,"So you're talking about me, and then?"
m_ex_admi_03_33,"We're talking about you,"
m_ex_admi_03_34,and...
m_ex_admi_03_35,umm...
m_ex_admi_03_36,.
m_ex_admi_03_37,.
m_ex_admi_03_38,.
m_ex_admi_03_39,Yes?
m_ex_admi_03_40,and...
m_ex_admi_03_41,.
m_ex_admi_03_42,.
m_ex_admi_03_43,.
m_ex_admi_03_44,I miss you.
m_ex_admi_03_45,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_admi_03_46,"Eeep, sorry!"
m_ex_admi_03_47,You must be very busy.
m_ex_admi_03_48,I shouldn't be bugging you.
m_ex_admi_03_49,You're not...
m_ex_admi_03_50,Ugh!
m_ex_admi_03_51,I should
m_ex_admi_03_52,get back to work!
m_ex_admi_03_53,"Bye, Commander!"
m_ex_admi_03_54,Admi?
m_ex_admi_03_55,... Admi doesn't reply.
m_ex_admi_03_56,Seems like I need to contact her later.
m_ex_alice_01_1,"Rabbity, did you hear?"
m_ex_alice_01_2,The Queen told me to visit you!
m_ex_alice_01_3,I'm told that I was selected from all of Rabbity's...
m_ex_alice_01_4,recruits?
m_ex_alice_01_5,I won!
m_ex_alice_01_6,"Yes, I chose Alice!"
m_ex_alice_01_7,Wow!
m_ex_alice_01_8,Congrats! ^___^
m_ex_alice_01_9,"Wait, that's not right! Shouldn't I be congratulated instead?"
m_ex_alice_01_10,"Hehe, I don't know."
m_ex_alice_01_11,Let's just celebrate anyway!
m_ex_alice_01_12,Congratulations.
m_ex_alice_01_13,"I'm so happy to hear that I can stay with you,"
m_ex_alice_01_14,Rabbity!
m_ex_alice_01_15,I'm so happy!
m_ex_alice_01_16,Do you feel the same?
m_ex_alice_01_17,Of course.
m_ex_alice_01_18,Hehehe.
m_ex_alice_01_19,"I like you, Rabbity."
m_ex_alice_01_20,"I hope we can get along well,"
m_ex_alice_01_21,Rabbity! :D
m_ex_alice_01_22,Me too.
m_ex_alice_02_1,"Hey, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alice_02_2,You know that mysterious room of yours?
m_ex_alice_02_3,Mysterious room?
m_ex_alice_02_4,The one that leads you to another world!
m_ex_alice_02_5,Do you mean the Elevator?
m_ex_alice_02_6,Yes :3
m_ex_alice_02_7,I think that's the name!
m_ex_alice_02_8,"It's a magic room, right?"
m_ex_alice_02_9,Yep yep.
m_ex_alice_02_10,"Then,"
m_ex_alice_02_11,is there another magic room
m_ex_alice_02_12,that leads to your room?
m_ex_alice_02_13,No.
m_ex_alice_02_14,Why not?
m_ex_alice_02_15,The magic for that hasn't been developed yet.
m_ex_alice_02_16,My level isn't advanced enough.
m_ex_alice_02_17,It allows me to live more diligently.
m_ex_alice_02_18,Magic development?
m_ex_alice_02_19,That definitely sounds complicated!
m_ex_alice_02_20,It is.
m_ex_alice_02_21,Hmm...
m_ex_alice_02_22,What if I ask Queen for help?
m_ex_alice_02_23,"Ludmilla won't be able to answer, either."
m_ex_alice_02_24,"Rabbity, your level is too low?"
m_ex_alice_02_25,"Sadly, yes."
m_ex_alice_02_26,"Hm... Rabbity, you shouldn't be sad."
m_ex_alice_02_27,T^T
m_ex_alice_02_28,Don't cry T^T
m_ex_alice_02_29,"Rabbity, are you a lazy person?"
m_ex_alice_02_30,"Yes, nothing beats rolling around on my bed."
m_ex_alice_02_31,Hehe! Is that so?
m_ex_alice_02_32,"I like lazy Rabbity, too! ^__^"
m_ex_alice_02_33,Thanks.
m_ex_alice_02_34,I want to use the magic room
m_ex_alice_02_35,"so I can see you asap, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alice_02_36,Boohoo.
m_ex_alice_02_37,What a bummer.
m_ex_alice_02_38,"You gotta walk, then."
m_ex_alice_02_39,"Hehe, guess I've got no choice then"
m_ex_alice_02_40,since I wanna see you!
m_ex_alice_02_41,I'll walk over asap!
m_ex_alice_02_42,You can do it!
m_ex_alice_02_43,Yes! :3
m_ex_alice_03_1,(＼(＼
m_ex_alice_03_2,(･ × ･)
m_ex_alice_03_3,"O_("") ("")"
m_ex_alice_03_4,Guess who?
m_ex_alice_03_5,Alice
m_ex_alice_03_6,Me
m_ex_alice_03_7,Nuh-uh!
m_ex_alice_03_8,You've got that wrong!
m_ex_alice_03_9,"Ding, ding, ding!"
m_ex_alice_03_10,We have a winner!
m_ex_alice_03_11,The answer is Rabbity! ^__^
m_ex_alice_03_12,I missed you bunches and bunches today.
m_ex_alice_03_13,"I was gonna walk over to the Ark,"
m_ex_alice_03_14,"but the Queen said that if I left,"
m_ex_alice_03_15,all the poor sleeping princesses
m_ex_alice_03_16,may never have the chance to meet you :(
m_ex_alice_03_17,That's why I made some Rabbit emojis instead! :3
m_ex_alice_03_18,／(･ × ･)＼
m_ex_alice_03_19,"O_("") ("")"
m_ex_alice_03_20,This is a sad Rabbity with its ears down.
m_ex_alice_03_21,And this is...
m_ex_alice_03_22,(＼    / )
m_ex_alice_03_23,( o x o )
m_ex_alice_03_24,"O_("") ("")"
m_ex_alice_03_25,is a surprised Rabbity with its ears standing at attention!
m_ex_alice_03_26,Do I really make those faces?
m_ex_alice_03_27,Yep!
m_ex_alice_03_28,"The sad expression is for when your friends get hurt,"
m_ex_alice_03_29,and the surprised one is for when they're in danger.
m_ex_alice_03_30,"Ah! Come to think of it, Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_03_31,you really do care a lot about your friends!
m_ex_alice_03_32,"That includes you as well, Alice."
m_ex_alice_03_33,"Wow,"
m_ex_alice_03_34,really?
m_ex_alice_03_35,"That's great! After all,"
m_ex_alice_03_36,you're the one who's gonna take me to paradise.
m_ex_alice_03_37,It's only natural we'd be friends!
m_ex_alice_03_38,That's right.
m_ex_alice_03_39,Hehe!
m_ex_alice_03_40,"When we meet again,"
m_ex_alice_03_41,I'll use your expressions to
m_ex_alice_03_42,"create more cute emojis, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alice_03_43,Have fun!
m_ex_alice_03_44,Can't wait to see them.
m_ex_alice_03_45,Hehe! :3
m_ex_anis_01_1,Commander.
m_ex_anis_01_2,"Excuse me for suddenly asking,"
m_ex_anis_01_3,but how do you feel about us fighting together?
m_ex_anis_01_4,Not bad.
m_ex_anis_01_5,It looks like we're not really in sync.
m_ex_anis_01_6,Really?
m_ex_anis_01_7,I didn't expect that.
m_ex_anis_01_8,I thought you'd say something like we don't obey your orders
m_ex_anis_01_9,or that we have no respect
m_ex_anis_01_10,"as usual, and blah blah blah."
m_ex_anis_01_11,Is that so?
m_ex_anis_01_12,I think our coordination will get better after getting along for a while.
m_ex_anis_01_13,"After all, we either win our battles, or we die."
m_ex_anis_01_14,"Anyway,"
m_ex_anis_01_15,"yet here we are, the two of us out here together."
m_ex_anis_01_16,"Still, I am looking forward to working with you, Commander."
m_ex_anis_01_17,"Then, what do you think of me?"
m_ex_anis_01_18,What?
m_ex_anis_01_19,Ah!
m_ex_anis_01_20,"You mean, my opinion of you?"
m_ex_anis_01_21,"Well,"
m_ex_anis_01_22,I don't have much of an opinion.
m_ex_anis_01_23,It doesn't matter if our minds are in sync or if we get along or not.
m_ex_anis_01_24,"Anyway,"
m_ex_anis_01_25,what I do care about is that one of us might die soon LOL
m_ex_anis_01_26,No one will die.
m_ex_anis_01_27,I sure hope so.
m_ex_anis_01_28,There's nothing better I can hope for than to survive together.
m_ex_anis_01_29,Let's pray for our future
m_ex_anis_01_30,"and wish ourselves good luck, Commander."
m_ex_anis_01_31,Good luck!
m_ex_anis_01_32,All right!
m_ex_anis_02_1,Commander!
m_ex_anis_02_2,Comaaaanndddeeerrr!!
m_ex_anis_02_3,COM...
m_ex_anis_02_4,MAN...
m_ex_anis_02_5,What is it now?
m_ex_anis_02_6,So you finally replied!
m_ex_anis_02_7,I answered as soon as I got your message.
m_ex_anis_02_8,Hahahaha!
m_ex_anis_02_9,"It's nothing important, really."
m_ex_anis_02_10,"When I got out of the shower today,"
m_ex_anis_02_11,it came to my mind that we're all out of soda.
m_ex_anis_02_12,"Soooo, I was thinking..."
m_ex_anis_02_13,I'll have them replenished.
m_ex_anis_02_14,Woo-hoo!
m_ex_anis_02_15,That's our Commander!
m_ex_anis_02_16,You're quick!
m_ex_anis_02_17,Anything else?
m_ex_anis_02_18,What else?
m_ex_anis_02_19,Well...
m_ex_anis_02_20,I just need to tell you what we need?
m_ex_anis_02_21,"In that case, can you get us"
m_ex_anis_02_22,some fruit-flavored soda this time?
m_ex_anis_02_23,How about lemon?
m_ex_anis_02_24,How about lime?
m_ex_anis_02_25,Sounds good.
m_ex_anis_02_26,"I don't really care what flavor it is,"
m_ex_anis_02_27,get whatever you want!
m_ex_anis_02_28,Okay
m_ex_anis_02_29,"Hey, what's going on?"
m_ex_anis_02_30,Did you
m_ex_anis_02_31,"do something wrong, Commander?"
m_ex_anis_02_32,No.
m_ex_anis_02_33,Why are you being so nice all of a sudden?
m_ex_anis_02_34,I've always been nice.
m_ex_anis_02_35,"That's true, but"
m_ex_anis_02_36,Idk... you seem much nicer to me than you usually do?
m_ex_anis_02_37,Would you rather I'm not?
m_ex_anis_02_38,"No,"
m_ex_anis_02_39,I didn't say that...
m_ex_anis_02_40,Then...??
m_ex_anis_02_41,Hahahaha
m_ex_anis_02_42,"It's nothing! Anyway, thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_anis_02_43,Sure...
m_ex_anis_03_1,"Commander, where are you?"
m_ex_anis_03_2,Helllloooooo?
m_ex_anis_03_3,I'm in my room.
m_ex_anis_03_4,Huh?
m_ex_anis_03_5,I was just there and didn't see anyone in the room.
m_ex_anis_03_6,"Oh, I went outside for a moment to speak with Rapi."
m_ex_anis_03_7,Huh???
m_ex_anis_03_8,I was with Rapi this whole time.
m_ex_anis_03_9,I went to the Workshop after that.
m_ex_anis_03_10,Huh???
m_ex_anis_03_11,But I was at the Workshop this entire time!
m_ex_anis_03_12,Huh???
m_ex_anis_03_13,Wha???
m_ex_anis_03_14,What??
m_ex_anis_03_15,?????
m_ex_anis_03_16,Hahahahaha
m_ex_anis_03_17,Just messin with ya.
m_ex_anis_03_18,"I have something for you, so I went to your room earlier."
m_ex_anis_03_19,I figured I'd ask since I didn't see anyone in the room.
m_ex_anis_03_20,"Gosh, your reaction was so cute! Hahaha!!"
m_ex_anis_03_21,What if I get addicted to pulling pranks like these?
m_ex_anis_03_22,Please don't.
m_ex_anis_03_23,"All right, all right, I won't. Hehe."
m_ex_anis_03_24,"Anyhoo, I'll be dropping by your room later."
m_ex_anis_03_25,All right.
m_ex_belorta_01_1,"Hi, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_belorta_01_2,Do you like firecrackers?
m_ex_belorta_01_3,Old-Timer...
m_ex_belorta_01_4,"Well,"
m_ex_belorta_01_5,"if you don't want me to call you Old-Timer,"
m_ex_belorta_01_6,"I can also call you Commander, just like everyone else."
m_ex_belorta_01_7,You don't need to.
m_ex_belorta_01_8,I would appreciate that.
m_ex_belorta_01_9,Aha!
m_ex_belorta_01_10,I knew it!
m_ex_belorta_01_11,"You also want to be closer to me, right?"
m_ex_belorta_01_12,You do?
m_ex_belorta_01_13,Huh... Are you sure you prefer being called Commander?
m_ex_belorta_01_14,"Well, I don't like it."
m_ex_belorta_01_15,"Old-Timer sounds cuter and sweeter, doesn't it?"
m_ex_belorta_01_16,"So let's just go with Old-Timer, shall we? ♡"
m_ex_belorta_01_17,"Oh right,"
m_ex_belorta_01_18,let's save that discussion for another time.
m_ex_belorta_01_19,"Now, tell me whether you like firecrackers or not?"
m_ex_belorta_01_20,"Come on, tell me ♡"
m_ex_belorta_01_21,"Yes, I do like firecrackers."
m_ex_belorta_01_22,"Well, I'm not sure."
m_ex_belorta_01_23,I knew it!
m_ex_belorta_01_24,"Of course, you must be fond of firecrackers!"
m_ex_belorta_01_25,"Hahaha, that's awesome!"
m_ex_belorta_01_26,"I see, so you really do like firecrackers!"
m_ex_belorta_01_27,???
m_ex_belorta_01_28,"When you mention 'not sure' under normal situations,"
m_ex_belorta_01_29,wouldn't that mean that you don't dislike them?
m_ex_belorta_01_30,So that means you do like them!
m_ex_belorta_01_31,I guess you're right.
m_ex_belorta_01_32,Right? What did I tell you?
m_ex_belorta_01_33,Hahahahaha
m_ex_belorta_01_34,"Since you also enjoy firecrackers,"
m_ex_belorta_01_35,I'm starting to like you more than before!
m_ex_belorta_01_36,I'm sure we'll have loads of fun in the future!
m_ex_belorta_01_37,Right?
m_ex_belorta_01_38,I couldn't agree more.
m_ex_belorta_01_39,Excellent ♡
m_ex_belorta_01_40,Let's continue to have fun like today and
m_ex_belorta_01_41,have loads of delicious food ♡
m_ex_belorta_01_42,"All right, Old-Timer? ♡"
m_ex_belorta_01_43,Sure thing.
m_ex_belorta_02_1,"Heya, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_belorta_02_2,"Yoohoo, anybody home?"
m_ex_belorta_02_3,Just once will do.
m_ex_belorta_02_4,But you weren't responding quickly enough!
m_ex_belorta_02_5,Hehehehehehe
m_ex_belorta_02_6,Can I ask you something?
m_ex_belorta_02_7,"To be honest, I'm gonna ask you either way."
m_ex_belorta_02_8,Go ahead.
m_ex_belorta_02_9,"Are you into Splendamin doughnuts, by any chance?"
m_ex_belorta_02_10,I am.
m_ex_belorta_02_11,Excellent!
m_ex_belorta_02_12,Which flavor do you like best?
m_ex_belorta_02_13,Glazed Splendamin doughnuts?
m_ex_belorta_02_14,Chocolate Splendamin doughnuts?
m_ex_belorta_02_15,"Yes, glazed ones are the best! ♡"
m_ex_belorta_02_16,You can never go wrong with the classics!
m_ex_belorta_02_17,"Yes, chocolate ones are the best! ♡"
m_ex_belorta_02_18,So sweet and fluffy...
m_ex_belorta_02_19,Just thinking about it is making my mouth water!
m_ex_belorta_02_20,"What flavor do you like, Belorta?"
m_ex_belorta_02_21,Me?
m_ex_belorta_02_22,Hmm... I like both ♡
m_ex_belorta_02_23,I can't just pick one!
m_ex_belorta_02_24,"If I ever get tired of glazed doughnuts, I can always have chocolate ones instead."
m_ex_belorta_02_25,"Once I get tired of chocolate doughnuts, I'll just return to glazed ones!"
m_ex_belorta_02_26,You're a foodie all right.
m_ex_belorta_02_27,Darn straight!
m_ex_belorta_02_28,That's why I can never pick one :3
m_ex_belorta_02_29,"Man, I've really got a hankering for Splendamin doughnuts now..."
m_ex_belorta_02_30,I'm gonna go buy some right now.
m_ex_belorta_02_31,I won't go too crazy this time. Let's say... 10 each?
m_ex_belorta_02_32,10?
m_ex_belorta_02_33,"Hmm, maybe that's not enough."
m_ex_belorta_02_34,Let's go with 15! ^___^
m_ex_belorta_02_35,I'm off then!
m_ex_belorta_02_36,I've really got a craving. Can't wait any longer!
m_ex_belorta_02_37,See you.
m_ex_belorta_03_1,"Hey, Old-Timer :D
What are you up to?"
m_ex_belorta_03_2,I'm working.
m_ex_belorta_03_3,Oh yeah?
m_ex_belorta_03_4,How come you're so busy all the time?
m_ex_belorta_03_5,You might overwork yourself and get sick! What'll you do then? TT^TT
m_ex_belorta_03_6,What's the matter?
m_ex_belorta_03_7,"Nothing, it's just that..."
m_ex_belorta_03_8,I reaaaaalllly miss you!
m_ex_belorta_03_9,I was gonna ask
m_ex_belorta_03_10,if you wanted to hang out?
m_ex_belorta_03_11,I see.
m_ex_belorta_03_12,Hey!
m_ex_belorta_03_13,What kind of answer is that?
m_ex_belorta_03_14,"Give it to me straight, will ya! >:("
m_ex_belorta_03_15,"Sorry, now's not a good time."
m_ex_belorta_03_16,Boo... that's too bad.
m_ex_belorta_03_17,Can't you spare just a moment?
m_ex_belorta_03_18,I won't take up too much of your time.
m_ex_belorta_03_19,"I just wanted to get something to eat, that's all."
m_ex_belorta_03_20,Unless...
m_ex_belorta_03_21,You're too busy even for that?
m_ex_belorta_03_22,That's right.
m_ex_belorta_03_23,Seriously?
m_ex_belorta_03_24,I see.
m_ex_belorta_03_25,I guess it can't be helped that
m_ex_belorta_03_26,Mica and I will come help you!
m_ex_belorta_03_27,Hehehehehehehehehehe
m_ex_belorta_03_28,That oughta help take a load off your shoulders!
m_ex_belorta_03_29,Waddya say? :3
m_ex_belorta_03_30,"Actually, I think I can pencil you in."
m_ex_belorta_03_31,"I'm really sorry, but I can't."
m_ex_belorta_03_32,Really? Just like that?
m_ex_belorta_03_33,Yes.
m_ex_belorta_03_34,"It's not because you don't want us to help you, is it?"
m_ex_belorta_03_35,Of course not.
m_ex_belorta_03_36,Hehehehehehehehehehe
m_ex_belorta_03_37,"All right, then :D"
m_ex_belorta_03_38,Aw man...
m_ex_belorta_03_39,You must really have your hands full.
m_ex_belorta_03_40,"Fine, I won't bother you anymore."
m_ex_belorta_03_41,All right!
m_ex_belorta_03_42,No more kidding around!
m_ex_belorta_03_43,This is serious business!
m_ex_belorta_03_44,Go on and do what you have to do.
m_ex_belorta_03_45,I'll stop disturbing you.
m_ex_belorta_03_46,Are you sure you don't mind?
m_ex_belorta_03_47,"Yep, it's fine."
m_ex_belorta_03_48,Talking to you just now
m_ex_belorta_03_49,was fun enough for me.
m_ex_belorta_03_50,I should be able to hold out for another day.
m_ex_belorta_03_51,"However,"
m_ex_belorta_03_52,that means we'll have to hang out longer tomorrow!
m_ex_belorta_03_53,Got it?
m_ex_belorta_03_54,I promise.
m_ex_belorta_03_55,Hehehehehe
m_ex_belorta_03_56,"See you tomorrow then, Old-Timer ♡"
m_ex_brid_01_1,"Hi, Commander!"
m_ex_brid_01_2,"I'm Brid,"
m_ex_brid_01_3,a Nikke from Infinity Rail.
m_ex_brid_01_4,I'm also a conductor for Ark Express.
m_ex_brid_01_5,Looks like we're gonna be working together.
m_ex_brid_01_6,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_brid_01_7,Nice to meet you too.
m_ex_brid_01_8,Do you have any questions about me?
m_ex_brid_01_9,Questions?
m_ex_brid_01_10,"Yes, questions."
m_ex_brid_01_11,"Whenever a Nikke receives a support request,"
m_ex_brid_01_12,"she should first establish contact with the CO,"
m_ex_brid_01_13,"introduce herself,"
m_ex_brid_01_14,and elucidate them as to
m_ex_brid_01_15,how she should be commanded.
m_ex_brid_01_16,Have any other Nikkes contacted you before?
m_ex_brid_01_17,"Well, not really..."
m_ex_brid_01_18,Of course.
m_ex_brid_01_19,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_brid_01_20,So I'm the first Nikke who's ever contacted you.
m_ex_brid_01_21,That's fine. Let's just start with getting to know each other.
m_ex_brid_01_22,Then I assume you're familiar with the process.
m_ex_brid_01_23,Allow me to ask again.
m_ex_brid_01_24,Do you have any questions about me?
m_ex_brid_01_25,Are you usually in the Ark?
m_ex_brid_01_26,Yes.
m_ex_brid_01_27,Hardly surprising considering
m_ex_brid_01_28,that I'm a conductor for Ark Express.
m_ex_brid_01_29,I drive the AZX.
m_ex_brid_01_30,AZX?
m_ex_brid_01_31,!
m_ex_brid_01_32,Don't tell me you've never heard of AZX?!
m_ex_brid_01_33,I've heard of it.
m_ex_brid_01_34,Never heard of it.
m_ex_brid_01_35,Of course.
m_ex_brid_01_36,What are they teaching you at those Military Academy?
m_ex_brid_01_37,This should be common knowledge...
m_ex_brid_01_38,I was joking.
m_ex_brid_01_39,!!
m_ex_brid_01_40,My apologies.
m_ex_brid_01_41,I got ahead of myself.
m_ex_brid_01_42,"Of course, you would have heard of it."
m_ex_brid_01_43,Allow me to introduce it in further detail.
m_ex_brid_01_44,AZX stands for Ark Zero Express.
m_ex_brid_01_45,"After AFX, the first train in the Ark, was attacked by terrorists,"
m_ex_brid_01_46,"a new name was formulated, and thus Zero came to be."
m_ex_brid_01_47,It offers safer and more expedient transportation for its passengers.
m_ex_brid_01_48,What a cool name!
m_ex_brid_01_49,"Very cool, indeed."
m_ex_brid_01_50,My thoughts exactly.
m_ex_brid_01_51,That's it.
m_ex_brid_01_52,Any other questions?
m_ex_brid_01_53,What do you do on your days off?
m_ex_brid_01_54,What's your type?
m_ex_brid_01_55,"Actually,"
m_ex_brid_01_56,I don't have days off.
m_ex_brid_01_57,"For me, I'm either working,"
m_ex_brid_01_58,or on standby waiting for the call.
m_ex_brid_01_59,"Occasionally, I'll take a moment to decompress,"
m_ex_brid_01_60,"so perhaps you could consider that my ""day off."""
m_ex_brid_01_61,My type?
m_ex_brid_01_62,Yeah.
m_ex_brid_01_63,AZX.
m_ex_brid_01_64,???
m_ex_brid_01_65,"That's my ""type."""
m_ex_brid_01_66,Nothing else.
m_ex_brid_01_67,I see.
m_ex_brid_01_68,"Considering you're starting to ask me personal questions,"
m_ex_brid_01_69,I assume you don't have any questions related to working with me.
m_ex_brid_01_70,"If you don't mind,"
m_ex_brid_01_71,I should get back to work.
m_ex_brid_01_72,"By the way,"
m_ex_brid_01_73,I'm often quite busy.
m_ex_brid_01_74,Please keep that in mind.
m_ex_brid_01_75,Sure.
m_ex_brid_01_76,Great.
m_ex_brid_01_77,"See you next time, Commander."
m_ex_brid_02_1,Commander!
m_ex_brid_02_2,did you ride AZX today?
m_ex_brid_02_3,??
m_ex_brid_02_4,Guess not.
m_ex_brid_02_5,Sorry.
m_ex_brid_02_6,"If you had, I was gonna ask you something."
m_ex_brid_02_7,I thought I saw you at Royal Road Station.
m_ex_brid_02_8,"Anyway, forget I said anything."
m_ex_brid_02_9,What do you want to ask me?
m_ex_brid_02_10,"Actually,"
m_ex_brid_02_11,we received a report today
m_ex_brid_02_12,about a strange individual
m_ex_brid_02_13,spreading vicious rumors about a murder
m_ex_brid_02_14,that has taken place on the train.
m_ex_brid_02_15,All we have for a description is that they were holding some kind of telescope.
m_ex_brid_02_16,Oh my.
m_ex_brid_02_17,"By the time I arrived on site,"
m_ex_brid_02_18,the mysterious passenger was nowhere to be found.
m_ex_brid_02_19,I can't determine whether the report has any truth to it.
m_ex_brid_02_20,That's why I thought I could ask you whether you had noticed anyone unusual.
m_ex_brid_02_21,Aren't there surveillance cameras on the train?
m_ex_brid_02_22,Of course.
m_ex_brid_02_23,"Unfortunately, thanks to a screw-up by one of our employees,"
m_ex_brid_02_24,all the cameras were down during the time the mystery passenger showed up.
m_ex_brid_02_25,I see.
m_ex_brid_02_26,There's nothing we can do but
m_ex_brid_02_27,fix our surveillance cameras
m_ex_brid_02_28,and wait for this person to show up again.
m_ex_brid_02_29,What do they look like?
m_ex_brid_02_30,"I'm not entirely sure,"
m_ex_brid_02_31,"but I heard it was a female. Apparently, she was"
m_ex_brid_02_32,wearing a beret and a plaid shirt.
m_ex_brid_02_33,!!
m_ex_brid_02_34,??
m_ex_brid_02_35,Did she talk as if she were a detective?
m_ex_brid_02_36,"Not sure about that,"
m_ex_brid_02_37,but I was told she spoke in a rather peculiar manner.
m_ex_brid_02_38,Is she someone you know?
m_ex_brid_02_39,Potentially.
m_ex_brid_02_40,Does she strike you as the kind of person
m_ex_brid_02_41,who would launch a terrorist attack?
m_ex_brid_02_42,Definitely not.
m_ex_brid_02_43,That's good to hear.
m_ex_brid_02_44,Are you positive?
m_ex_brid_02_45,There was another terrorist attack against the AFX.
m_ex_brid_02_46,So everyone's on edge.
m_ex_brid_02_47,I'm 100% certain that she is not a terrorist.
m_ex_brid_02_48,Hmmm...
m_ex_brid_02_49,She's just a self-professed detective who's always hot on one case or another.
m_ex_brid_02_50,I see.
m_ex_brid_02_51,I suppose those are all my questions for now.
m_ex_brid_02_52,"If you say you trust her,"
m_ex_brid_02_53,I'll take your word for it.
m_ex_brid_02_54,"However, to prevent such things from happening again,"
m_ex_brid_02_55,I'll have the surveillance cameras fixed and security tightened.
m_ex_brid_02_56,Good idea.
m_ex_brid_02_57,"Also, please tell your friend that"
m_ex_brid_02_58,if she goes around
m_ex_brid_02_59,creating a public disturbance
m_ex_brid_02_60,"by spreading rumors again,"
m_ex_brid_02_61,she won't be so lucky next time.
m_ex_brid_02_62,I'll do that.
m_ex_brid_02_63,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_brid_02_64,Talk to you soon.
m_ex_brid_02_65,Sorry for disrupting your work.
m_ex_brid_02_66,Don't worry.
m_ex_brid_02_67,I need to remind Novel to take it easy.
m_ex_brid_03_1,"Commander, I was hoping you could help me with something."
m_ex_brid_03_2,What is it?
m_ex_brid_03_3,How can I work more efficiently?
m_ex_brid_03_4,More so than you are right now?
m_ex_brid_03_5,Precisely.
m_ex_brid_03_6,I want to work more efficiently than I do at the present.
m_ex_brid_03_7,You can't.
m_ex_brid_03_8,Why not?
m_ex_brid_03_9,You'll just end up wearing yourself down.
m_ex_brid_03_10,"No, I won't."
m_ex_brid_03_11,"If I work more efficiently,"
m_ex_brid_03_12,I'll spend less time working.
m_ex_brid_03_13,"Ergo, I'll have more time to rest."
m_ex_brid_03_14,You're lying.
m_ex_brid_03_15,...
m_ex_brid_03_16,"Yes,"
m_ex_brid_03_17,I was lying.
m_ex_brid_03_18,Sorry.
m_ex_brid_03_19,"However,"
m_ex_brid_03_20,greater efficiency does mean I could get more work done.
m_ex_brid_03_21,"Who knows, if I keep working like this"
m_ex_brid_03_22,I may just reach the point where there isn't any room for improvement one day.
m_ex_brid_03_23,"You don't actually think that's possible, do you?"
m_ex_brid_03_24,...
m_ex_brid_03_25,"Sorry,"
m_ex_brid_03_26,you got me again.
m_ex_brid_03_27,You're right.
m_ex_brid_03_28,There is no end when it comes to self-improvement.
m_ex_brid_03_29,"Rather, it's like a train on an endless loop."
m_ex_brid_03_30,"In that case, you should pump the brakes."
m_ex_brid_03_31,Just keep things as they are.
m_ex_brid_03_32,How can I slow down?
m_ex_brid_03_33,"The moment I take a break,"
m_ex_brid_03_34,work will start to pile up.
m_ex_brid_03_35,All this talk of taking it easy... That's crazy talk!
m_ex_brid_03_36,Slowing down is not an option.
m_ex_brid_03_37,"Regardless, thank you for your concern."
m_ex_brid_03_38,How about you don't change anything and just keep on truckin'?
m_ex_brid_03_39,"Keep things as they are, you say?"
m_ex_brid_03_40,I suppose you're right.
m_ex_brid_03_41,"If the track I'm on has no end,"
m_ex_brid_03_42,I need to be careful not to overexert myself.
m_ex_brid_03_43,Perhaps that's the best course of action.
m_ex_brid_03_44,Thank you for the advice.
m_ex_brid_03_45,My mind's a bit scrambled from all this work lately.
m_ex_brid_03_46,"I'll just ""keep on truckin,"" as you say."
m_ex_brid_03_47,Good luck.
m_ex_brid_03_48,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_brid_03_49,You too.
m_ex_centi_01_1,"Hi, I'm Centi."
m_ex_centi_01_2,Are you the new Boss?
m_ex_centi_01_3,Nice to meet you!
m_ex_centi_01_4,You too.
m_ex_centi_01_5,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_centi_01_6,Are you handy with tools?
m_ex_centi_01_7,Sure am.
m_ex_centi_01_8,Not at all.
m_ex_centi_01_9,Oh yeah?
m_ex_centi_01_10,"Actually, it doesn't really matter whether you're good with tools or not."
m_ex_centi_01_11,If you ever need someone to craft something
m_ex_centi_01_12,"or make repairs, feel free to contact me!"
m_ex_centi_01_13,I'll solve your problem
m_ex_centi_01_14,right in a jiffy!
m_ex_centi_01_15,You seem very reliable.
m_ex_centi_01_16,Thanks!
m_ex_centi_01_17,Can you repair someone's heart?
m_ex_centi_01_18,You mean a human heart?
m_ex_centi_01_19,Um... it may be faster if you see a doctor for that.
m_ex_centi_01_20,"But if you want, I could give it a few whacks with some of my tools!"
m_ex_centi_01_21,...
m_ex_centi_01_22,I wonder if there are any blue prints or schematics
m_ex_centi_01_23,of the human heart?
m_ex_centi_01_24,Those would be a big help.
m_ex_centi_01_25,I was joking.
m_ex_centi_01_26,"Oh, you were?"
m_ex_centi_01_27,Thank goodness!
m_ex_centi_01_28,I was wondering how the heck I'd repair a human heart!
m_ex_centi_01_29,Hahaha.
m_ex_centi_01_30,I gotta get back to work.
m_ex_centi_01_31,Call me if you ever need anything!
m_ex_centi_01_32,Will do.
m_ex_centi_02_1,Boss!
m_ex_centi_02_2,I have a question!
m_ex_centi_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_centi_02_4,"When it comes to an opulent yet minimalist building,"
m_ex_centi_02_5,should it lean more towards the opulent side
m_ex_centi_02_6,or the minimalist side?
m_ex_centi_02_7,"It should be beautifully minimalist, but not too ostentatious."
m_ex_centi_02_8,I have no idea.
m_ex_centi_02_9,Hmm...
m_ex_centi_02_10,You're not answering my question!
m_ex_centi_02_11,You have no idea either?
m_ex_centi_02_12,This is a fine kettle of fish!
m_ex_centi_02_13,Did you receive an order?
m_ex_centi_02_14,Yeah.
m_ex_centi_02_15,A construction order.
m_ex_centi_02_16,"The client wants an ""opulent yet minimalist"" building"
m_ex_centi_02_17,that will wow visitors the instant they set eyes on it.
m_ex_centi_02_18,"However, Liter says"
m_ex_centi_02_19,those demands are absolute nonsense!
m_ex_centi_02_20,"So, did you accept the order?"
m_ex_centi_02_21,I don't know.
m_ex_centi_02_22,Liter hasn't made up her mind.
m_ex_centi_02_23,I don't think it's a good idea to take this order.
m_ex_centi_02_24,I think you should take it. At least you'll gain some experience.
m_ex_centi_02_25,You think so?
m_ex_centi_02_26,I don't feel right about it either.
m_ex_centi_02_27,Is that so?
m_ex_centi_02_28,I'm not so sure...
m_ex_centi_02_29,!!
m_ex_centi_02_30,Boss! I just overheard Liter
m_ex_centi_02_31,turning down the order.
m_ex_centi_02_32,Looks like you dodged a bullet.
m_ex_centi_02_33,Exactly!
m_ex_centi_02_34,That's a relief!
m_ex_centi_02_35,This one would have been impossible.
m_ex_centi_02_36,Ugh!
m_ex_centi_02_37,Liter and I are heading off on a business trip.
m_ex_centi_02_38,Catch you later!
m_ex_centi_02_39,Have a safe trip.
m_ex_centi_02_40,"Thanks, bye!"
m_ex_centi_03_1,Boss!
m_ex_centi_03_2,I'm in the hospital!
m_ex_centi_03_3,Are you injured?!
m_ex_centi_03_4,Not exactly.
m_ex_centi_03_5,"I accidently bopped my hand with a hammer, that's all."
m_ex_centi_03_6,Sounds like an injury to me.
m_ex_centi_03_7,!!
m_ex_centi_03_8,Really?
m_ex_centi_03_9,Are you all right?
m_ex_centi_03_10,"I think I'm fine,"
m_ex_centi_03_11,but Liter insisted I go to the hospital.
m_ex_centi_03_12,So here I am.
m_ex_centi_03_13,What did the doctor say?
m_ex_centi_03_14,Mary said she'd never seen
m_ex_centi_03_15,such a tough cookie!
m_ex_centi_03_16,I suppose that means you're lucky.
m_ex_centi_03_17,Of course!
m_ex_centi_03_18,"Actually, I feel more humiliated than anything"
m_ex_centi_03_19,for making such a stupid mistake.
m_ex_centi_03_20,I wish I could dig a hole and bury myself in it.
m_ex_centi_03_21,Everyone makes mistakes.
m_ex_centi_03_22,Yeah?
m_ex_centi_03_23,"Luckily, you're not seriously injured."
m_ex_centi_03_24,Thank you for your concern!
m_ex_centi_03_25,All done at the hospital?
m_ex_centi_03_26,"Yep, I'm good to go!"
m_ex_centi_03_27,Time to get back to work.
m_ex_centi_03_28,Why not take a break?
m_ex_centi_03_29,No way! Liter will be up to her elbows in work otherwise.
m_ex_centi_03_30,I've gotta get back and help her out asap!
m_ex_centi_03_31,Back on the clock!
m_ex_centi_03_32,Take care.
m_ex_centi_03_33,Will do!
m_ex_centi_03_34,"Thank you, Boss!"
m_ex_crow_01_1,You sent a call signal to the Outer Rim?
m_ex_crow_01_2,Have you lost your mind?
m_ex_crow_01_3,Who knows what kind of riff raff will come calling?
m_ex_crow_01_4,Talent isn't determined by background.
m_ex_crow_01_5,I sent the call signal for you.
m_ex_crow_01_6,You really think that?
m_ex_crow_01_7,You're quite the idealist
m_ex_crow_01_8,"or loony, depending on how you look at it."
m_ex_crow_01_9,What?
m_ex_crow_01_10,What's wrong with you?
m_ex_crow_01_11,Have you got a screw loose or something?
m_ex_crow_01_12,Nope.
m_ex_crow_01_13,You sure?
m_ex_crow_01_14,"Bored and can't wait to get back into the fray, is that it?"
m_ex_crow_01_15,"I may be part of this little justice squad you've got going,"
m_ex_crow_01_16,"but I'm what people would consider a bad apple, so"
m_ex_crow_01_17,let me give you a word of advice.
m_ex_crow_01_18,It's all right putting outlaws like me
m_ex_crow_01_19,"to work,"
m_ex_crow_01_20,but it's best to keep your distance.
m_ex_crow_01_21,Why?
m_ex_crow_01_22,It'll be bad news for you.
m_ex_crow_01_23,There's a saying around these parts that goes something like this;
m_ex_crow_01_24,"If you work around filth, you're going to get dirty."
m_ex_crow_01_25,"Any ideology,"
m_ex_crow_01_26,"particularly those that are radical or violent in nature,"
m_ex_crow_01_27,can easily infect others.
m_ex_crow_01_28,Nikkes in the Outer Rim are the worst of all
m_ex_crow_01_29,since they're outcasts without any tether to society.
m_ex_crow_01_30,"They seek to kill their masters by any means necessary,"
m_ex_crow_01_31,even being brainwashed.
m_ex_crow_01_32,"When you let someone like that join your squad,"
m_ex_crow_01_33,"the devil's on your doorstep,"
m_ex_crow_01_34,and you're inviting him in.
m_ex_crow_01_35,I don't think you're like that.
m_ex_crow_01_36,I don't paint all outlaws with the same brush.
m_ex_crow_01_37,Haha.
m_ex_crow_01_38,What makes you so sure?
m_ex_crow_01_39,"If you are as bad as you say, you wouldn't be warning me as you did just now."
m_ex_crow_01_40,...
m_ex_crow_01_41,Fair enough.
m_ex_crow_01_42,"I could give you about ten refutes,"
m_ex_crow_01_43,but we'll set that aside for now.
m_ex_crow_01_44,What makes you so sure you can trust them?
m_ex_crow_01_45,A group is not a singular entity. It's composed of individuals.
m_ex_crow_01_46,...
m_ex_crow_01_47,I didn't expect such level-headedness from you.
m_ex_crow_01_48,"Seems reasonable enough,"
m_ex_crow_01_49,but you'll change your tune
m_ex_crow_01_50,if it comes back to bite you one day.
m_ex_crow_01_51,"Anyway, we're teammates now."
m_ex_crow_01_52,It's no use arguing about it with you.
m_ex_crow_01_53,"Hopefully, we can work well together."
m_ex_crow_01_54,"I'm sure you'll come to regret it, though."
m_ex_crow_01_55,"Anyway, I won't bore you anymore."
m_ex_crow_01_56,Try not to judge me too harshly.
m_ex_crow_01_57,Crow read my message but hasn't replied.
m_ex_crow_01_58,Guess she won't be taking it easy on me.
m_ex_crow_02_1,I wonder...
m_ex_crow_02_2,what will happen if a human is killed by a Nikke here.
m_ex_crow_02_3,?!
m_ex_crow_02_4,Is this some kind of warning?
m_ex_crow_02_5,Haha.
m_ex_crow_02_6,No need to be scared.
m_ex_crow_02_7,?
m_ex_crow_02_8,What makes you say that?
m_ex_crow_02_9,"Well, there's only one human at this Outpost, and you're talking to 'em."
m_ex_crow_02_10,True...
m_ex_crow_02_11,"It makes sense for you to think like that,"
m_ex_crow_02_12,but you don't have to worry.
m_ex_crow_02_13,No need to jump to conclusions.
m_ex_crow_02_14,"Anyway, what'd happen to the Nikke IF something like this were to occur?"
m_ex_crow_02_15,She'd be declared an Irregular and scrapped.
m_ex_crow_02_16,Enikk would have her put on trial.
m_ex_crow_02_17,So it's no different than if it happened in the Ark.
m_ex_crow_02_18,What a letdown.
m_ex_crow_02_19,The courtrooms in each Outpost
m_ex_crow_02_20,operate independently of the Ark.
m_ex_crow_02_21,I thought things would be more interesting here.
m_ex_crow_02_22,"Once death is involved, whether something is interesting or not should be the last thing on one's mind."
m_ex_crow_02_23,Sorry to disappoint you.
m_ex_crow_02_24,"Yeah yeah,"
m_ex_crow_02_25,I'll just agree to disagree for now.
m_ex_crow_02_26,Apology accepted.
m_ex_crow_02_27,"Hopefully, I can get a"
m_ex_crow_02_28,more pleasing answer next time.
m_ex_crow_02_29,What about a Nikke killing another Nikke?
m_ex_crow_02_30,Would that go down as it does in the Ark?
m_ex_crow_02_31,It's largely a judgment call from the Commander.
m_ex_crow_02_32,Oh.
m_ex_crow_02_33,So you finally acknowledged the power you hold over us.
m_ex_crow_02_34,"After all, crimes involving human victims and crimes merely involving one's property"
m_ex_crow_02_35,can hardly be measured by the same standard.
m_ex_crow_02_36,"Well, at least I finally heard something of interest."
m_ex_crow_02_37,I can make good use of it.
m_ex_crow_02_38,Use?
m_ex_crow_02_39,Just talking to myself.
m_ex_crow_02_40,Thanks.
m_ex_crow_02_41,You're the only Commander who
m_ex_crow_02_42,has ever taken my questions seriously.
m_ex_crow_02_43,I think we'll get along just fine.
m_ex_crow_02_44,"What do you mean by ""use""?"
m_ex_crow_02_45,"Despite their differences, black and white"
m_ex_crow_02_46,are the most closely interlinked colors.
m_ex_crow_02_47,"Hence, it's only natural that we'd share some similarities."
m_ex_crow_02_48,Catch you later.
m_ex_crow_02_49,Answer my question.
m_ex_crow_02_50,Crow hasn't replied since then...
m_ex_crow_03_1,Did you hear about the terrorist attack against the TV station several days ago?
m_ex_crow_03_2,The TV station isn't too pleased.
m_ex_crow_03_3,They've been covering it practically 24/7.
m_ex_crow_03_4,I haven't been watching the news.
m_ex_crow_03_5,Really?
m_ex_crow_03_6,That's great!
m_ex_crow_03_7,"Since the media hasn't sunk their claws into you,"
m_ex_crow_03_8,you may be able to give me an honest answer.
m_ex_crow_03_9,What do you wanna know?
m_ex_crow_03_10,Do you think the perpetrator
m_ex_crow_03_11,behind this attack
m_ex_crow_03_12,comes from the Outer Rim?
m_ex_crow_03_13,I hesitate to answer.
m_ex_crow_03_14,Well?
m_ex_crow_03_15,Cat got your tongue?
m_ex_crow_03_16,I'm just asking.
m_ex_crow_03_17,Don't be so nervous.
m_ex_crow_03_18,Think of it as a Rorschach test.
m_ex_crow_03_19,I guess so.
m_ex_crow_03_20,I don't think so.
m_ex_crow_03_21,Really?
m_ex_crow_03_22,You think so too?
m_ex_crow_03_23,I didn't expect that.
m_ex_crow_03_24,I thought you'd say
m_ex_crow_03_25,the opposite.
m_ex_crow_03_26,You really are familiar with the Outer Rim. How impressive!
m_ex_crow_03_27,Did I guess correctly?
m_ex_crow_03_28,Who knows?
m_ex_crow_03_29,Is he not from the Outer Rim?
m_ex_crow_03_30,That's right.
m_ex_crow_03_31,I figured that's what you'd say.
m_ex_crow_03_32,Did I guess correctly?
m_ex_crow_03_33,Who knows?
m_ex_crow_03_34,Is he not from the Outer Rim?
m_ex_crow_03_35,No idea.
m_ex_crow_03_36,???
m_ex_crow_03_37,I heard that he was born and grew up at Royal Road.
m_ex_crow_03_38,"At 18, he was sent to the Outer Rim,"
m_ex_crow_03_39,where he spent the next 18 years of his life.
m_ex_crow_03_40,It's the same amount of time he spent at Royal Road.
m_ex_crow_03_41,Which begs the question:
m_ex_crow_03_42,which was it that led him astray?
m_ex_crow_03_43,"Royal Road, where he grew up,"
m_ex_crow_03_44,"or the Outer Rim, where he spent his adulthood?"
m_ex_crow_03_45,What do you think?
m_ex_crow_03_46,Royal Road.
m_ex_crow_03_47,Outer Rim.
m_ex_crow_03_48,Neither.
m_ex_crow_03_49,How come?
m_ex_crow_03_50,It's where he grew up.
m_ex_crow_03_51,"Even if he spent most of his adult life in the Outer Rim,"
m_ex_crow_03_52,he was born at Royal Road.
m_ex_crow_03_53,"Therefore, that's where it all went wrong?"
m_ex_crow_03_54,I wish you could say that to these damned TV stations.
m_ex_crow_03_55,They're always going on about how the Outer Rim corrupted him.
m_ex_crow_03_56,"It's like you said,"
m_ex_crow_03_57,your birthplace has the greatest effect on you.
m_ex_crow_03_58,"Although his time in the Outer Rim, to be fair, may have"
m_ex_crow_03_59,"given birth to his criminal ways,"
m_ex_crow_03_60,at least that's what the news says.
m_ex_crow_03_61,So you think it was the Outer Rim as well?
m_ex_crow_03_62,You're no different from those talking heads
m_ex_crow_03_63,"on the news, spewing their vitriol."
m_ex_crow_03_64,"According to them,"
m_ex_crow_03_65,"although he was born at Royal Road,"
m_ex_crow_03_66,his time at the Outer Rim turned him into what he is today.
m_ex_crow_03_67,So you could say it was the Outer Rim that did him in.
m_ex_crow_03_68,Huh?
m_ex_crow_03_69,Neither?
m_ex_crow_03_70,"Of course, he was born at Royal Road"
m_ex_crow_03_71,"and might have been ""reborn"" as a terrorist"
m_ex_crow_03_72,in the Outer Rim.
m_ex_crow_03_73,"However,"
m_ex_crow_03_74,one can't place the blame on any one place.
m_ex_crow_03_75,At least not on one any more than the other.
m_ex_crow_03_76,"Actually, I'm not too bothered to get to the bottom of this."
m_ex_crow_03_77,I'm just curious about your thoughts on this matter.
m_ex_crow_03_78,"Anyway, I got what I wanted out of this."
m_ex_crow_03_79,It was interesting chatting with you.
m_ex_crow_03_80,We'll talk later.
m_ex_delta_01_1,You called for me?
m_ex_delta_01_2,Yep.
m_ex_delta_01_3,"No matter what task you assign to me,"
m_ex_delta_01_4,I will complete them as quickly and precisely as I can.
m_ex_delta_01_5,"Oh, I just wanted to say hi."
m_ex_delta_01_6,Say hi?
m_ex_delta_01_7,... Delta suddenly doesn't know what to reply.
m_ex_delta_01_8,"Hi, Scout!"
m_ex_delta_01_9,"Sorry,"
m_ex_delta_01_10,please allow me to start over.
m_ex_delta_01_11,"Hello,"
m_ex_delta_01_12,"I'm Delta from the Scouts,"
m_ex_delta_01_13,manufactured by Elysion. I'm designed
m_ex_delta_01_14,to provoke our enemies and defend allies by setting up the Decoy Hologram.
m_ex_delta_01_15,You can loosen up. No need to be so serious.
m_ex_delta_01_16,"Besides, when attacked, I can use my special"
m_ex_delta_01_17,"Ah,"
m_ex_delta_01_18,I see.
m_ex_delta_01_19,I apologize if I failed to say hi properly.
m_ex_delta_01_20,May I first consult my teammate about it?
m_ex_delta_01_21,Sure.
m_ex_delta_01_22,It looks like Delta is really going to ask her squadmates for advice...
m_ex_delta_01_23,I'm back.
m_ex_delta_01_24,"Commander, may I know if you like training or not?"
m_ex_delta_01_25,Why are you asking me this?
m_ex_delta_01_26,"According to my squadmate,"
m_ex_delta_01_27,the best way to break the ice during the first meeting
m_ex_delta_01_28,is to share your interests.
m_ex_delta_01_29,"As a soldier, I've always been interested in training, and it's also part of my daily routine."
m_ex_delta_01_30,Training is part of a soldier's duty. It's not an interest.
m_ex_delta_01_31,I'm interested in guerrilla training.
m_ex_delta_01_32,Is that so?
m_ex_delta_01_33,I didn't expect that.
m_ex_delta_01_34,My squadmate's suggestion doesn't seem to work for me.
m_ex_delta_01_35,Please allow me to get back to her first.
m_ex_delta_01_36,Hold on a minute.
m_ex_delta_01_37,"Sure,"
m_ex_delta_01_38,I'll be awaiting your reply.
m_ex_delta_01_39,"Actually, I enjoy guerrilla training too. Well, kinda."
m_ex_delta_01_40,"Oh, is that so?"
m_ex_delta_01_41,You do seem like the type who prefers a mix of tough training routines.
m_ex_delta_01_42,May I say that I'm suddenly overwhelmed with respect for you?
m_ex_delta_01_43,I'd like to train with you next time at the Elysion Tower
m_ex_delta_01_44,if that's okay.
m_ex_delta_01_45,??
m_ex_delta_01_46,Don't fret.
m_ex_delta_01_47,"Since both of us are professionals,"
m_ex_delta_01_48,I'd definitely select the hardest level.
m_ex_delta_01_49,... It's probably too late to stop Delta now.
m_ex_delta_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_delta_02_2,do you have a moment?
m_ex_delta_02_3,What's wrong?
m_ex_delta_02_4,I have an urgent matter to discuss with you.
m_ex_delta_02_5,Tell me.
m_ex_delta_02_6,"While I was scouting the base a while ago,"
m_ex_delta_02_7,I received a strange message from the Radio Tower.
m_ex_delta_02_8,I couldn't make it out very clearly since the signal wasn't that great.
m_ex_delta_02_9,"However, from what I could tell,"
m_ex_delta_02_10,someone on this base
m_ex_delta_02_11,is in a relationship with several Nikkes.
m_ex_delta_02_12,Whoever sent out this broadcast
m_ex_delta_02_13,said they would hunt this guy down to the ends of the earth if need be
m_ex_delta_02_14,and put them through such hell that they'd wish they were dead.
m_ex_delta_02_15,End of report.
m_ex_delta_02_16,...
m_ex_delta_02_17,It's not me.
m_ex_delta_02_18,Sorry?
m_ex_delta_02_19,"Oh, don't worry."
m_ex_delta_02_20,You're not on my list of suspects.
m_ex_delta_02_21,"However, you're currently"
m_ex_delta_02_22,the only human on this base.
m_ex_delta_02_23,I thought it best to bring this to your attention
m_ex_delta_02_24,and see if you could surmise who is behind the message.
m_ex_delta_02_25,^__^|||
m_ex_delta_02_26,Can you describe the voice of the person who sent the message?
m_ex_delta_02_27,"It was a shrill female voice, so"
m_ex_delta_02_28,the speaker is estimated to be in her late 20's or early 30's.
m_ex_delta_02_29,That doesn't fit the profile of anyone in the base.
m_ex_delta_02_30,"If that's the case,"
m_ex_delta_02_31,who could have sent that message?
m_ex_delta_02_32,Perhaps there's a ghost in the Radio Tower
m_ex_delta_02_33,Maybe Ingrid stopped by
m_ex_delta_02_34,Cut it out!
m_ex_delta_02_35,Who'd want to be on a night watch
m_ex_delta_02_36,after hearing a creepy ghost story?
m_ex_delta_02_37,Are you afraid of ghosts?
m_ex_delta_02_38,"Not necessarily, but it's just that"
m_ex_delta_02_39,"I know firearms have absolutely no effect on ghosts,"
m_ex_delta_02_40,"so they'd be difficult to deal with, that's all."
m_ex_delta_02_41,Come again?
m_ex_delta_02_42,"No matter how fiery the boss' personality is,"
m_ex_delta_02_43,she would never interfere in other's romantic endeavors.
m_ex_delta_02_44,"Wait a sec,"
m_ex_delta_02_45,I just received an emergency call from Signal.
m_ex_delta_02_46,One moment.
m_ex_delta_02_47,... Delta seems to be talking with Signal.
m_ex_delta_02_48,Eureka! So that's what it is!
m_ex_delta_02_49,Care to elaborate?
m_ex_delta_02_50,"While waiting at the Radio Tower today,"
m_ex_delta_02_51,Signal watched the TV show Love and Gunshots.
m_ex_delta_02_52,She was so caught up in it that she accidentally switched on her radio.
m_ex_delta_02_53,She only just realized what happened and called me to explain.
m_ex_delta_02_54,The female voice I heard on the radio was the actress in the TV show.
m_ex_delta_02_55,She was furious upon discovering her husband having an affair
m_ex_delta_02_56,and was giving him a piece of her mind.
m_ex_delta_02_57,End of report.
m_ex_delta_02_58,Delta
m_ex_delta_02_59,Yes!
m_ex_delta_02_60,Make sure this doesn't happen again.
m_ex_delta_02_61,"Yes, sir!"
m_ex_delta_02_62,"In the future, check in with the radio first before bringing such things to my attention."
m_ex_delta_02_63,Absolutely! I'm terribly sorry!
m_ex_delta_02_64,I apologize for any inconvenience caused!
m_ex_delta_02_65,I'll report back to duty at once!
m_ex_delta_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_delta_03_2,I found an old box while I was cleaning out the warehouse in the Watchtower.
m_ex_delta_03_3,I opened it and there seem to be all sorts of items inside.
m_ex_delta_03_4,Do you know anything about this?
m_ex_delta_03_5,Can't say I do.
m_ex_delta_03_6,I see.
m_ex_delta_03_7,Then I will discard this box.
m_ex_delta_03_8,What exactly is inside?
m_ex_delta_03_9,Please wait a moment.
m_ex_delta_03_10,Delta becomes unresponsive for a while.
m_ex_delta_03_11,Sorry to keep you waiting.
m_ex_delta_03_12,I will report my findings:
m_ex_delta_03_13,"Combat Rations ×10
Combat Knife ×1
Men's Thermal Underwear Set ×4
Socks ×4
Type A Tent ×1

Details are as above"
m_ex_delta_03_14,Seems like it belonged to a soldier.
m_ex_delta_03_15,Seems like it belonged to a Commander.
m_ex_delta_03_16,"Yes, there is a high probability of that."
m_ex_delta_03_17,Is there any form of identification?
m_ex_delta_03_18,"No, there isn't."
m_ex_delta_03_19,"Wait,"
m_ex_delta_03_20,though there is something at the bottom of the box.
m_ex_delta_03_21,One moment.
m_ex_delta_03_22,Delta becomes unresponsive for a while.
m_ex_delta_03_23,Sorry to keep you waiting again.
m_ex_delta_03_24,I've never seen anything like this before.
m_ex_delta_03_25,It has a flat square shape.
m_ex_delta_03_26,It protrudes into a roundish shape in the middle
m_ex_delta_03_27,and has triangles dotting along the edge.
m_ex_delta_03_28,Wait a minute...
m_ex_delta_03_29,I'll open it.
m_ex_delta_03_30,Those are vitamins.
m_ex_delta_03_31,What was that?
m_ex_delta_03_32,I said those are vitamins.
m_ex_delta_03_33,"Oh,"
m_ex_delta_03_34,I see.
m_ex_delta_03_35,"Now that I think about it,"
m_ex_delta_03_36,I seem to recall hearing about how humans used to take vitamins in the past.
m_ex_delta_03_37,Would you like me to give it to you?
m_ex_delta_03_38,Yes please
m_ex_delta_03_39,Very well.
m_ex_delta_03_40,I'll bring it over at once.
m_ex_delta_03_41,Right now?
m_ex_delta_03_42,"Yes, I am nearby."
m_ex_delta_03_43,I'll be there momentarily.
m_ex_delta_03_44,Delta becomes unresponsive for a while.
m_ex_delta_03_45,Sorry for taking so long.
m_ex_delta_03_46,I've already delivered it.
m_ex_delta_03_47,??
m_ex_delta_03_48,"I met Rapi on my way here, so I handed it to her."
m_ex_delta_03_49,"I told her you would be using it,"
m_ex_delta_03_50,so she should bring it to you soon enough.
m_ex_delta_03_51,Um...
m_ex_delta_03_52,??
m_ex_delta_03_53,Is something wrong?
m_ex_delta_03_54,Did Rapi say anything?
m_ex_delta_03_55,Not really.
m_ex_delta_03_56,"However,"
m_ex_delta_03_57,she did have this thousand-yard stare.
m_ex_delta_03_58,"I've never seen her like that before,"
m_ex_delta_03_59,not even on the battlefield.
m_ex_delta_03_60,I see
m_ex_delta_03_61,"Well then, I'll resume my rounds."
m_ex_delta_03_62,Have a good day!
m_ex_delta_03_63,You too.
m_ex_diesel_01_1,"Wow, Commander!"
m_ex_diesel_01_2,I heard that
m_ex_diesel_01_3,we're going to be on a mission together this time! Hehehe!
m_ex_diesel_01_4,I'm so happy!
m_ex_diesel_01_5,I can't believe I can be with you everyday!
m_ex_diesel_01_6,I'm happy too.
m_ex_diesel_01_7,I am
m_ex_diesel_01_8,"very, very happy!"
m_ex_diesel_01_9,"So, I went downtown today"
m_ex_diesel_01_10,to buy some new strawberry candy.
m_ex_diesel_01_11,New strawberry candy?
m_ex_diesel_01_12,That's right!
m_ex_diesel_01_13,Isn't it nice to find interest
m_ex_diesel_01_14,in something new?
m_ex_diesel_01_15,"So I think, for this exciting new journey"
m_ex_diesel_01_16,"that is about to begin,"
m_ex_diesel_01_17,I want to share my new strawberry candy with everyone.
m_ex_diesel_01_18,Do you have to?
m_ex_diesel_01_19,What do you mean do I have to?
m_ex_diesel_01_20,"These little new things, when added together,"
m_ex_diesel_01_21,turn into excitement.
m_ex_diesel_01_22,This kind of excitement will make you feel better!
m_ex_diesel_01_23,"So for me, the new strawberry candy"
m_ex_diesel_01_24,are like these messages
m_ex_diesel_01_25,that I'm sending you right now.
m_ex_diesel_01_26,I'm super excited!
m_ex_diesel_01_27,I see.
m_ex_diesel_01_28,"In that case,"
m_ex_diesel_01_29,I can help you buy some strawberry candies if you need them?
m_ex_diesel_01_30,"If I turn you down, will you listen and not buy any for me?"
m_ex_diesel_01_31,Well... I'm not so sure about that.
m_ex_diesel_01_32,"If you really don't like the things I give you,"
m_ex_diesel_01_33,I might become upset and just not buy them for you.
m_ex_diesel_01_34,"But I'm sure you won't say anything like that to me,"
m_ex_diesel_01_35,right?
m_ex_diesel_01_36,Yes.
m_ex_diesel_01_37,No.
m_ex_diesel_01_38,"Hehehe! Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_diesel_01_39,I was kind of worried there.
m_ex_diesel_01_40,I'm not sure what I'd do if you said no.
m_ex_diesel_01_41,Now I can buy you strawberry candy with ease.
m_ex_diesel_01_42,It can't be! You're really mean to me today!
m_ex_diesel_01_43,There's nothing I can do.
m_ex_diesel_01_44,I'll have to use the strawberry candy to cure you of your
m_ex_diesel_01_45,mean attitude!
m_ex_diesel_01_46,"So, you'll still buy me strawberry candy?"
m_ex_diesel_01_47,"Yes, you got that right!"
m_ex_diesel_01_48,I'll meet you later with my new strawberry candy!
m_ex_diesel_01_49,Take care.
m_ex_diesel_02_1,Hey!
m_ex_diesel_02_2,Are you busy?
m_ex_diesel_02_3,"No, I'm not."
m_ex_diesel_02_4,"Nice, hehehe!"
m_ex_diesel_02_5,Can I confide in you for a second?
m_ex_diesel_02_6,"It's nothing serious, but..."
m_ex_diesel_02_7,Tell me.
m_ex_diesel_02_8,I heard Tetra will be holding
m_ex_diesel_02_9,idol auditions soon.
m_ex_diesel_02_10,Have you heard about this?
m_ex_diesel_02_11,Not yet.
m_ex_diesel_02_12,"Well, it's what they call"
m_ex_diesel_02_13,a 'blind audition'.
m_ex_diesel_02_14,The judges make their selection purely based on your skill.
m_ex_diesel_02_15,I was considering throwing my hat in the ring.
m_ex_diesel_02_16,"The only thing is, I'm not sure whether to focus on dancing or singing."
m_ex_diesel_02_17,Singing
m_ex_diesel_02_18,Dancing
m_ex_diesel_02_19,So you think singing is a better choice?
m_ex_diesel_02_20,I've actually written a song
m_ex_diesel_02_21,but I want to dance as well...
m_ex_diesel_02_22,"Ugh, I can't decide!"
m_ex_diesel_02_23,"Since singing is the most fundamental skill for any idols,"
m_ex_diesel_02_24,don't you think that it would be better to show off some dance skills?
m_ex_diesel_02_25,"Ugh, I can't decide!"
m_ex_diesel_02_26,"To be honest, I've actually written a song."
m_ex_diesel_02_27,Your own song?
m_ex_diesel_02_28,"Yep, I call this peppy little ditty,"
m_ex_diesel_02_29,The Journey Together (with AZX).
m_ex_diesel_02_30,Why don't you choreograph a dance to the song?
m_ex_diesel_02_31,!!
m_ex_diesel_02_32,Why didn't I think of that?!
m_ex_diesel_02_33,That's a perfect solution!
m_ex_diesel_02_34,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_diesel_02_35,I'll show you the dance the next time we meet.
m_ex_diesel_02_36,Can't wait to see it.
m_ex_diesel_02_37,I have to wait until the right time to show you the dance.
m_ex_diesel_02_38,"Otherwise, it won't be any good!"
m_ex_diesel_02_39,Hehe!
m_ex_diesel_02_40,"You'll just have to wait till then, Commander!"
m_ex_diesel_02_41,"All right, it's decided then."
m_ex_diesel_02_42,I should hurry and start practicing.
m_ex_diesel_02_43,I'll be in touch when I pass the audition!
m_ex_diesel_03_1,Commander!
m_ex_diesel_03_2,Give me an 'A'!
m_ex_diesel_03_3,... A??
m_ex_diesel_03_4,A!
m_ex_diesel_03_5,Give me a 'Z'!
m_ex_diesel_03_6,??
m_ex_diesel_03_7,"Oh, come on!"
m_ex_diesel_03_8,C'mon you've gotta be on the ball!
m_ex_diesel_03_9,What do you want me to say?
m_ex_diesel_03_10,"Come, tell me what comes to your mind when you hear AZ?"
m_ex_diesel_03_11,AZ??
m_ex_diesel_03_12,Hm... Why don't I give you another hint?
m_ex_diesel_03_13,"Somewhere Brid, Soline, and I are together!"
m_ex_diesel_03_14,"Now, I've given away everything!"
m_ex_diesel_03_15,"You know now, right?"
m_ex_diesel_03_16,"Yea, I think I do."
m_ex_diesel_03_17,Good!
m_ex_diesel_03_18,"I'll start over, so repeat after me!"
m_ex_diesel_03_19,Okay?
m_ex_diesel_03_20,All right!
m_ex_diesel_03_21,Then let's start with A again!
m_ex_diesel_03_22,A!
m_ex_diesel_03_23,Give me a 'Z'!
m_ex_diesel_03_24,X!
m_ex_diesel_03_25,X?
m_ex_diesel_03_26,And...?
m_ex_diesel_03_27,Feels like I need to say something
m_ex_diesel_03_28,Straw!
m_ex_diesel_03_29,Die!
m_ex_diesel_03_30,Berry!
m_ex_diesel_03_31,Can?
m_ex_diesel_03_32,Dy!
m_ex_diesel_03_33,Are?
m_ex_diesel_03_34,The best~!
m_ex_diesel_03_35,"You are so witty, Commander!"
m_ex_diesel_03_36,You're the best!
m_ex_diesel_03_37,Sel?
m_ex_diesel_03_38,likes!
m_ex_diesel_03_39,Hm...
m_ex_diesel_03_40,Hm?
m_ex_diesel_03_41,Hmm...
m_ex_diesel_03_42,Hmm...?
m_ex_diesel_03_43,Com~!
m_ex_diesel_03_44,Man?
m_ex_diesel_03_45,Der!
m_ex_diesel_03_46,Me?
m_ex_diesel_03_47,"Yes, I like you!"
m_ex_diesel_03_48,Woohoo!
m_ex_diesel_03_49,I didn't know you were going to say something unexpected!
m_ex_diesel_03_50,I was worried that it'll end really quickly!
m_ex_diesel_03_51,"You're pretty good at these things, Commander."
m_ex_diesel_03_52,Are you satisfied with my response?
m_ex_diesel_03_53,Yes!!
m_ex_diesel_03_54,Hehehehehe.
m_ex_diesel_03_55,Let's do this again next time!
m_ex_diesel_03_56,Please?
m_ex_diesel_03_57,Sure.
m_ex_dolla_01_1,"Hello, Client."
m_ex_dolla_01_2,"I figured since we're business partners,"
m_ex_dolla_01_3,I should give you a courtesy call and check in on you.
m_ex_dolla_01_4,"Why do you call me ""Client""?"
m_ex_dolla_01_5,Since we're business partners?
m_ex_dolla_01_6,A lot goes into your little excursions
m_ex_dolla_01_7,up on the surface.
m_ex_dolla_01_8,"I figure heavily into all that,"
m_ex_dolla_01_9,so it's only natural we'd work together like this.
m_ex_dolla_01_10,"So, you're an entrepreneur?"
m_ex_dolla_01_11,"So, you're a retailer of some sorts?"
m_ex_dolla_01_12,Bingo.
m_ex_dolla_01_13,You're not as dumb as you look. ^___^
m_ex_dolla_01_14,"Well,"
m_ex_dolla_01_15,selling goods is merely one aspect of what I do.
m_ex_dolla_01_16,I prefer the term entrepreneur.
m_ex_dolla_01_17,"Outside of the dealings I have with you,"
m_ex_dolla_01_18,"I also run New Wave,"
m_ex_dolla_01_19,"a renowned electronics company,"
m_ex_dolla_01_20,as well as several other IT branches.
m_ex_dolla_01_21,That about covers it.
m_ex_dolla_01_22,Care to know anything else?
m_ex_dolla_01_23,"I have a meeting in three minutes,"
m_ex_dolla_01_24,so I can spare time for one more question.
m_ex_dolla_01_25,You seem to have a handle on everything.
m_ex_dolla_01_26,How do you juggle your business and combat?
m_ex_dolla_01_27,??
m_ex_dolla_01_28,"That's not even a question,"
m_ex_dolla_01_29,and you shouldn't say that to a Nikke lol
m_ex_dolla_01_30,But I can tell that
m_ex_dolla_01_31,"you give credit where credit is due,"
m_ex_dolla_01_32,regardless of whether someone is a human or a Nikke.
m_ex_dolla_01_33,I respect that.
m_ex_dolla_01_34,;)
m_ex_dolla_01_35,It's easy.
m_ex_dolla_01_36,Time management is a basic skill all entrepreneurs must posses.
m_ex_dolla_01_37,"I always show up for a mission,"
m_ex_dolla_01_38,no excuses.
m_ex_dolla_01_39,So you don't have to worry about that ^___^
m_ex_dolla_01_40,"Well, that's all the time I have."
m_ex_dolla_01_41,Feel free to message me whenever you need supplies.
m_ex_dolla_01_42,Wait a sec.
m_ex_dolla_01_43,What?
m_ex_dolla_01_44,It's nice to be working with someone so trustworthy.
m_ex_dolla_01_45,Looking forward to doing business with you.
m_ex_dolla_01_46,...
m_ex_dolla_01_47,Hahaha!
m_ex_dolla_01_48,That's all you had to say?
m_ex_dolla_01_49,"Well, aren't you"
m_ex_dolla_01_50,just the cutest thing?
m_ex_dolla_01_51,"Normally, I make it a point to keep my personal and private life separate,"
m_ex_dolla_01_52,"but in your case, I think I can make an exception."
m_ex_dolla_01_53,There's a cafe in the same building as my company. Drop by when you're free.
m_ex_dolla_01_54,"You can order whatever you like,"
m_ex_dolla_01_55,and it'll be on the house ^___^
m_ex_dolla_01_56,Thanks.
m_ex_dolla_01_57,I will.
m_ex_dolla_01_58,Dolla hasn't read the message.
m_ex_dolla_01_59,It seems that her meeting has begun.
m_ex_dolla_02_1,Client.
m_ex_dolla_02_2,I need to conduct a survey
m_ex_dolla_02_3,on the tastes of young customers.
m_ex_dolla_02_4,Can you lend me a hand?
m_ex_dolla_02_5,This is all a bit sudden...
m_ex_dolla_02_6,Is the survey related to your products?
m_ex_dolla_02_7,"Yeah, sorry about that!"
m_ex_dolla_02_8,"You know more than anyone that my time is valuable,"
m_ex_dolla_02_9,so I'll get right to it.
m_ex_dolla_02_10,Here's the skinny.
m_ex_dolla_02_11,"There you are,"
m_ex_dolla_02_12,right like always.
m_ex_dolla_02_13,Let me fill in the blanks.
m_ex_dolla_02_14,"Our new project has to do with next-generation tablets,"
m_ex_dolla_02_15,so the target customers are young people.
m_ex_dolla_02_16,That's why I messaged you! ^___^
m_ex_dolla_02_17,"Just be sure to answer all questions honestly, okay?"
m_ex_dolla_02_18,Will do.
m_ex_dolla_02_19,Great! :)
m_ex_dolla_02_20,Here's the first question.
m_ex_dolla_02_21,Do you prefer top or bottom?
m_ex_dolla_02_22,Top.
m_ex_dolla_02_23,Bottom.
m_ex_dolla_02_24,What kind of question is that?
m_ex_dolla_02_25,I knew it.
m_ex_dolla_02_26,Most people choose top.
m_ex_dolla_02_27,"All right, next question. ^___^"
m_ex_dolla_02_28,Oh.
m_ex_dolla_02_29,That's an unexpected choice.
m_ex_dolla_02_30,"All right, next question."
m_ex_dolla_02_31,The position of the speaker!
m_ex_dolla_02_32,Should it be on the top or bottom of the tablet?
m_ex_dolla_02_33,What's the problem?
m_ex_dolla_02_34,Nothing.
m_ex_dolla_02_35,"Anyway, what do you think?"
m_ex_dolla_02_36,Top or bottom?
m_ex_dolla_02_37,"Partly hidden,"
m_ex_dolla_02_38,or completely visible.
m_ex_dolla_02_39,Which one do you prefer?
m_ex_dolla_02_40,Hidden.
m_ex_dolla_02_41,Visible.
m_ex_dolla_02_42,What is with these questions?!
m_ex_dolla_02_43,Very true.
m_ex_dolla_02_44,"After all, giving people a little tease"
m_ex_dolla_02_45,is better than just letting it all hang out.
m_ex_dolla_02_46,"Okay, final question."
m_ex_dolla_02_47,Hey now!
m_ex_dolla_02_48,I didn't expect
m_ex_dolla_02_49,"such an unfiltered answer, hehe!"
m_ex_dolla_02_50,Not that there's anything wrong with that :)
m_ex_dolla_02_51,Now I know what gets you going.
m_ex_dolla_02_52,"Okay, final question."
m_ex_dolla_02_53,What is it now?
m_ex_dolla_02_54,I'm just asking about the bezels on the tablet.
m_ex_dolla_02_55,"Should the touchscreen have bezels, or free of it?"
m_ex_dolla_02_56,I want to know which one you like.
m_ex_dolla_02_57,What's wrong with that?
m_ex_dolla_02_58,Nothing.
m_ex_dolla_02_59,"All right then,"
m_ex_dolla_02_60,what's your answer?
m_ex_dolla_02_61,Sexy black or gorgeous white?
m_ex_dolla_02_62,Pick one.
m_ex_dolla_02_63,Sexy black
m_ex_dolla_02_64,Gorgeous white.
m_ex_dolla_02_65,This is the worst one yet!
m_ex_dolla_02_66,"Hehe,"
m_ex_dolla_02_67,"a classic,"
m_ex_dolla_02_68,and classy to boot.
m_ex_dolla_02_69,Ohoho!
m_ex_dolla_02_70,Your answers are nothing like what I expected...
m_ex_dolla_02_71,But I already knew that
m_ex_dolla_02_72,just by observing your everyday behavior.
m_ex_dolla_02_73,???
m_ex_dolla_02_74,I'm asking about the back of the tablet.
m_ex_dolla_02_75,Should we go for a lacy pattern
m_ex_dolla_02_76,or a too-cool-for-school leather backing?
m_ex_dolla_02_77,What's weird about that?
m_ex_dolla_02_78,It's a basic question about product design!
m_ex_dolla_02_79,"Sorry, I misunderstood..."
m_ex_dolla_02_80,"Anyway,"
m_ex_dolla_02_81,what's your honest opinion?
m_ex_dolla_02_82,Lace or leather?
m_ex_dolla_02_83,Great.
m_ex_dolla_02_84,I've collected enough information.
m_ex_dolla_02_85,"Thanks for your help, hehe."
m_ex_dolla_02_86,We'll take all this into consideration
m_ex_dolla_02_87,when we design our next product.
m_ex_dolla_02_88,I'm sure it'll be helpful in other ways as well :)
m_ex_dolla_02_89,What other ways?
m_ex_dolla_02_90,"Sorry,"
m_ex_dolla_02_91,I've got a call coming in.
m_ex_dolla_02_92,Gotta go.
m_ex_dolla_02_93,"Hey, wait a minute!"
m_ex_dolla_02_94,Hahahahaha
m_ex_dolla_02_95,"Sorry, this call can't wait!"
m_ex_dolla_02_96,"Catch you on the flip side,"
m_ex_dolla_02_97,you adorable
m_ex_dolla_02_98,"little love bug, you!"
m_ex_dolla_03_1,"hEyi,"
m_ex_dolla_03_2,Client!
m_ex_dolla_03_3,Could you hekp me?
m_ex_dolla_03_4,"Sorry, typo."
m_ex_dolla_03_5,It's an emergenxy.
m_ex_dolla_03_6,What happened?
m_ex_dolla_03_7,AKK 28.53
m_ex_dolla_03_8,Help me csll the cops.
m_ex_dolla_03_9,Should they head to these coordinates?
m_ex_dolla_03_10,Is someone chasing you?
m_ex_dolla_03_11,Yeh
m_ex_dolla_03_12,Hurru up
m_ex_dolla_03_13,I call A.C.P.U. and tell them to go to that location.
m_ex_dolla_03_14,I just called them.
m_ex_dolla_03_15,There's no reply...
m_ex_dolla_03_16,"30 minutes later, still nothing."
m_ex_dolla_03_17,Oh!
m_ex_dolla_03_18,Thanks a bunch ^___^
m_ex_dolla_03_19,Everything's A-Okay now.
m_ex_dolla_03_20,What is going on here?
m_ex_dolla_03_21,"Oh, nothing, hehe."
m_ex_dolla_03_22,"Some traders were giving us a hard time, that's all."
m_ex_dolla_03_23,They wanted us to sell them goods that were already assigned to another contract.
m_ex_dolla_03_24,They even had some outlaw thugs
m_ex_dolla_03_25,try and put the screws to us.
m_ex_dolla_03_26,Sounds bad.
m_ex_dolla_03_27,What was it that they wanted?
m_ex_dolla_03_28,You can say that again.
m_ex_dolla_03_29,This whole debacle was a Grade A pain in my butt.
m_ex_dolla_03_30,"Sorry,"
m_ex_dolla_03_31,trade secret.
m_ex_dolla_03_32,"Anyway, I had no choice but to break the contract."
m_ex_dolla_03_33,(Inappropriate language detected. Unable to send SMS.)
m_ex_dolla_03_34,"Whoops, sorry 'bout that! Haha!"
m_ex_dolla_03_35,"I told them I'd sell them the goods, then sent them those coordinates."
m_ex_dolla_03_36,"Unfortunately, all they'll find there is a big ol' drug stash."
m_ex_dolla_03_37,I used my phone when they weren't looking
m_ex_dolla_03_38,to ask for your help.
m_ex_dolla_03_39,That explains all the typos.
m_ex_dolla_03_40,How did you know about those coordinates?
m_ex_dolla_03_41,Hehehe
m_ex_dolla_03_42,"You type with one hand without looking at the screen,"
m_ex_dolla_03_43,and see what you end up with!
m_ex_dolla_03_44,"It's always good to be well-informed in this business, hehe."
m_ex_dolla_03_45,"Besides, knowing about them isn't a crime."
m_ex_dolla_03_46,"And that, as they say, is that."
m_ex_dolla_03_47,"Thanks to you, it's a happy ending."
m_ex_dolla_03_48,Is there anything you want?
m_ex_dolla_03_49,"Name it, and it's yours."
m_ex_dolla_03_50,No thanks. I'm just glad you're safe.
m_ex_dolla_03_51,?
m_ex_dolla_03_52,Really?
m_ex_dolla_03_53,You may never get another opportunity like this!
m_ex_dolla_03_54,Yep.
m_ex_dolla_03_55,Oh.
m_ex_dolla_03_56,"if you ask me,"
m_ex_dolla_03_57,you're a total sucker! Hahahaha!
m_ex_dolla_03_58,You're no shark when it comes to this kind of thing.
m_ex_dolla_03_59,Isn't that what you like about me?
m_ex_dolla_03_60,Nonsense.
m_ex_dolla_03_61,I appreciate it.
m_ex_dolla_03_62,That kind of simplicity and honesty
m_ex_dolla_03_63,is hard to come by in the Ark.
m_ex_dolla_03_64,Just don't go changing on me ^____^
m_ex_dolla_03_65,Let others
m_ex_dolla_03_66,"do all the dirty work, myself included."
m_ex_dolla_03_67,I wouldn't ask that of you.
m_ex_dolla_03_68,"Haha, if you say so."
m_ex_dolla_03_69,"Anyway, duty calls."
m_ex_dolla_03_70,Gotta go.
m_ex_dolla_03_71,Thanks again for your help.
m_ex_dolla_03_72,It's been a pleasure. See ya :)
m_ex_drake_01_1,"Is that you, Moron?"
m_ex_drake_01_2,The one who called me out here.
m_ex_drake_01_3,"Just so you know, I don't work with just anyone,"
m_ex_drake_01_4,but only those I approve.
m_ex_drake_01_5,But it's actually pretty easy to gain my approval.
m_ex_drake_01_6,All you have to do is answer my questions.
m_ex_drake_01_7,Understood?
m_ex_drake_01_8,Got it.
m_ex_drake_01_9,Okay. Here comes the first question.
m_ex_drake_01_10,I just answered the first one.
m_ex_drake_01_11,What do you mean?
m_ex_drake_01_12,You asked me 'Understood?' and I said 'Got it.'
m_ex_drake_01_13,"Oh,"
m_ex_drake_01_14,right.
m_ex_drake_01_15,You've gained my approval.
m_ex_drake_01_16,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_drake_01_17,Okay.
m_ex_drake_01_18,"Since I'm working with you,"
m_ex_drake_01_19,everything is going to be better from now on.
m_ex_drake_01_20,You can start being happy now.
m_ex_drake_01_21,LOL
m_ex_drake_01_22,??
m_ex_drake_01_23,What?
m_ex_drake_01_24,"Are you laughing at me, Moron?"
m_ex_drake_01_25,"You told me to be happy, so I laughed."
m_ex_drake_01_26,I thought you were
m_ex_drake_01_27,laughing at me.
m_ex_drake_01_28,"C'mon, be happier!"
m_ex_drake_01_29,LOLOL
m_ex_drake_01_30,More!!
m_ex_drake_01_31,LOLOLOLOL
m_ex_drake_01_32,Phew!
m_ex_drake_01_33,Well done.
m_ex_drake_01_34,I'm looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_drake_02_1,I was walking down the street a couple of days ago
m_ex_drake_02_2,when a kid said that I was nice.
m_ex_drake_02_3,Nice?!
m_ex_drake_02_4,I practically had steam coming out of my ears!
m_ex_drake_02_5,Did you give him a good whack?
m_ex_drake_02_6,You dolt!
m_ex_drake_02_7,Nikkes should never strike a human!
m_ex_drake_02_8,"Come to think of it, no one should hit a human!"
m_ex_drake_02_9,So what did you do?
m_ex_drake_02_10,I gave him some candy.
m_ex_drake_02_11,That kid's teeth will eventually rot from all the candy he eats.
m_ex_drake_02_12,He'll have no choice but to go to the dentist!
m_ex_drake_02_13,Mwahahahaha!
m_ex_drake_02_14,I see.
m_ex_drake_02_15,People are starting to forget
m_ex_drake_02_16,that I am the ultimate villain.
m_ex_drake_02_17,"How can we remind them? Quick, give me some suggestions!"
m_ex_drake_02_18,Let's steal people's things.
m_ex_drake_02_19,Let's cause a ruckus at a store.
m_ex_drake_02_20,There is no answer from Drake.
m_ex_drake_02_21,Sorry for the late reply
m_ex_drake_02_22,but it doesn't look like it's worth replying to.
m_ex_drake_02_23,What happened?
m_ex_drake_02_24,I was passing by when I saw
m_ex_drake_02_25,that same kid from before.
m_ex_drake_02_26,He brought a friend and told him I was like a Guardian Angel!
m_ex_drake_02_27,Can you actually believe that?
m_ex_drake_02_28,"So, did you give them a wallop?"
m_ex_drake_02_29,You donkey-brain! Is that all you can think of?
m_ex_drake_02_30,You should never hit a child!!
m_ex_drake_02_31,I just gave them both some sweets.
m_ex_drake_02_32,"By tomorrow, they'll both be in the dentist's chair."
m_ex_drake_02_33,"Soon enough,"
m_ex_drake_02_34,everyone will think of me as the ultimate villain once more!
m_ex_drake_02_35,That's right.
m_ex_drake_02_36,Mwahahahaha!
m_ex_drake_02_37,I've still got it.
m_ex_drake_02_38,"You should be taking notes, dingbat."
m_ex_drake_02_39,Got it.
m_ex_drake_02_40,"All right, I'm off to harass more people."
m_ex_drake_03_1,Muahahaha!!
m_ex_drake_03_2,??
m_ex_drake_03_3,Mwahahahaha!
m_ex_drake_03_4,You utter fools! Such idiocy!
m_ex_drake_03_5,I shall be victorious!
m_ex_drake_03_6,Mwahahahahahahahaha!
m_ex_drake_03_7,What's going on?
m_ex_drake_03_8,"Oh, right."
m_ex_drake_03_9,I wanted to tell you about something crazy that happened today.
m_ex_drake_03_10,I just saw my profile on Maxwell's blabla.
m_ex_drake_03_11,Were you snooping on her?
m_ex_drake_03_12,What? No! I just happened to turn my head and...
m_ex_drake_03_13,That's not important right now!
m_ex_drake_03_14,Do you know what Maxwell has me saved as on blabla?
m_ex_drake_03_15,"It was shocking, let me tell you."
m_ex_drake_03_16,Maxwell has me saved as...
m_ex_drake_03_17,Drake!
m_ex_drake_03_18,Huh?
m_ex_drake_03_19,That's right!
m_ex_drake_03_20,"Me, the ultimate villain,"
m_ex_drake_03_21,and she had me as plain ol' 'Drake.'
m_ex_drake_03_22,"You didn't save me as the same thing, did you?"
m_ex_drake_03_23,Feels like I should say no for now.
m_ex_drake_03_24,No.
m_ex_drake_03_25,Are you sure?
m_ex_drake_03_26,What did you save me as then?
m_ex_drake_03_27,Ultimate Villain
m_ex_drake_03_28,Super Ultra Mega Dastardly Villainess Drake
m_ex_drake_03_29,Ultimate Villain will do just fine.
m_ex_drake_03_30,That's more like it!
m_ex_drake_03_31,Muahahaha!!
m_ex_drake_03_32,"Well done, keep it up!"
m_ex_drake_03_33,Okay.
m_ex_drake_03_34,I shouldn't use blabla in front of Drake for a while...
m_ex_emma_01_1,Commander!
m_ex_emma_01_2,Are you sleeping?
m_ex_emma_01_3,No.
m_ex_emma_01_4,Then where are you?
m_ex_emma_01_5,I'm currently in the Commander's Room.
m_ex_emma_01_6,Oh.
m_ex_emma_01_7,It's so late.
m_ex_emma_01_8,You are really hardworking T^T
m_ex_emma_01_9,But umm...
m_ex_emma_01_10,By any chance...
m_ex_emma_01_11,"I know this is sudden, but..."
m_ex_emma_01_12,can you do me a favor?
m_ex_emma_01_13,Of course.
m_ex_emma_01_14,Thanks!!
m_ex_emma_01_15,"Actually, earlier this morning,"
m_ex_emma_01_16,I think... I left something very important
m_ex_emma_01_17,in the Commander's Room ^__^|||
m_ex_emma_01_18,I'm wondering if you can get it for me?
m_ex_emma_01_19,What does it look like?
m_ex_emma_01_20,Hmm...
m_ex_emma_01_21,"I don't remember it exactly,"
m_ex_emma_01_22,but it's probably
m_ex_emma_01_23,a shopping bag with pink stripes?
m_ex_emma_01_24,Just a sec.
m_ex_emma_01_25,Ok!
m_ex_emma_01_26,Did you find it?
m_ex_emma_01_27,Commander?
m_ex_emma_01_28,Did you open the shopping bag by any chance?
m_ex_emma_01_29,Please tell me you didn't T^T
m_ex_emma_01_30,What should I do?
m_ex_emma_01_31,"Actually, that is..."
m_ex_emma_01_32,"my favorite brand, that's why I bought it."
m_ex_emma_01_33,It's not like I usually prefer
m_ex_emma_01_34,"bold designs, you know?"
m_ex_emma_01_35,"That's why,"
m_ex_emma_01_36,please don't be mistaken! ^^;
m_ex_emma_01_37,Rapi just passed by.
m_ex_emma_01_38,Ah.
m_ex_emma_01_39,Ah!!
m_ex_emma_01_40,Hmm...
m_ex_emma_01_41,I've got it.
m_ex_emma_01_42,Is there... any way to delete her memory?
m_ex_emma_01_43,No.
m_ex_emma_01_44,T^T
m_ex_emma_01_45,I suppose I have no other options.
m_ex_emma_01_46,That secret...
m_ex_emma_01_47,"Keep it to yourself, okay? T^T"
m_ex_emma_01_48,I will carry it to my grave.
m_ex_emma_01_49,... Guess I should hide the shopping bag somewhere secret.
m_ex_emma_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_02_2,are you busy right now?
m_ex_emma_02_3,I'm not.
m_ex_emma_02_4,"In that case,"
m_ex_emma_02_5,have you eaten?
m_ex_emma_02_6,"Not yet, but I could go for some food."
m_ex_emma_02_7,That's perfect!
m_ex_emma_02_8,Want to try out some food I just whipped up?
m_ex_emma_02_9,I'm afraid I'm no longer confident
m_ex_emma_02_10,in my cooking recently.
m_ex_emma_02_11,"That's why I need someone to give me some feedback, but"
m_ex_emma_02_12,I can't find Eunhwa and Vesti anywhere :(
m_ex_emma_02_13,"Now that I think about it, I'm not that hungry."
m_ex_emma_02_14,"Oh, really? :("
m_ex_emma_02_15,Then...
m_ex_emma_02_16,you can have it later!
m_ex_emma_02_17,Just be sure to tell me how it tastes!
m_ex_emma_02_18,Umm... what exactly is it?
m_ex_emma_02_19,It's fried-chicken-flavored chocolate!
m_ex_emma_02_20,"Sweet and salty always go together, don't you agree?"
m_ex_emma_02_21,It can satisfy both your appetite and sweet tooth all in one go.
m_ex_emma_02_22,It's like killing two birds with one stone!
m_ex_emma_02_23,"To be honest, I'm not really sold on that..."
m_ex_emma_02_24,Oh no! Do you not like sweets?
m_ex_emma_02_25,But I've really put my heart into this :(
m_ex_emma_02_26,or will mackerel bread be better?
m_ex_emma_02_27,That's the next dish I was going to prepare.
m_ex_emma_02_28,"If you want,"
m_ex_emma_02_29,I can make some mackerel bread and...
m_ex_emma_02_30,"Actually, I'm not feeling too well..."
m_ex_emma_02_31,Oh my.
m_ex_emma_02_32,Are you okay?
m_ex_emma_02_33,Do you need to go to the hospital? :(
m_ex_emma_02_34,I think so.
m_ex_emma_02_35,Then I will make some porridge and bring it over!
m_ex_emma_02_36,I just so happen to have some raw mackerel Splendamin.
m_ex_emma_02_37,I'll grind that up and toss it into the mix
m_ex_emma_02_38,so it'll be easier to digest.
m_ex_emma_02_39,Oh...
m_ex_emma_02_40,"You know what, Commander?"
m_ex_emma_02_41,I think I've regained my confidence in the kitchen again!
m_ex_emma_02_42,"Just as I thought,"
m_ex_emma_02_43,cooking is always best when you're making dishes for someone else!
m_ex_emma_02_44,Just thinking about my cooking helping soothe your upset stomach
m_ex_emma_02_45,motivates me like never before!
m_ex_emma_02_46,Hurry and get yourself to the hospital!
m_ex_emma_02_47,I'll whip that porridge up and be there in a jiffy.
m_ex_emma_02_48,"At this rate, you'll be better in no time! :3"
m_ex_emma_02_49,... I should avoid Emma for a while.
m_ex_emma_03_1,"Hey, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_03_2,How are you feeling today?
m_ex_emma_03_3,Seems like you've been pulling quite a few all-nighters lately.
m_ex_emma_03_4,I'm just making sure you're not stretching yourself too thin.
m_ex_emma_03_5,Everything is fine.
m_ex_emma_03_6,"I'm just a little tired, to be honest."
m_ex_emma_03_7,Are you sure?
m_ex_emma_03_8,"I know you're just saying that, so I don't worry about you."
m_ex_emma_03_9,But you don't have to do that for me.
m_ex_emma_03_10,"I'm just a little tired, to be honest."
m_ex_emma_03_11,I can only imagine!
m_ex_emma_03_12,I'm sure resting your head in my lap
m_ex_emma_03_13,will do you a world of good.
m_ex_emma_03_14,What do you say?
m_ex_emma_03_15,"Sorry, but I feel like I'm being pulled in so many directions."
m_ex_emma_03_16,I haven't heard anything negative
m_ex_emma_03_17,about your performance lately.
m_ex_emma_03_18,So what's got you in such a tizzy?
m_ex_emma_03_19,I'm worried that I won't be able to perform my job properly.
m_ex_emma_03_20,There are so many things I haven't accomplished yet.
m_ex_emma_03_21,I see...
m_ex_emma_03_22,"You're the center of attention right now,"
m_ex_emma_03_23,so it's completely understandable if the pressure got to you.
m_ex_emma_03_24,I see...
m_ex_emma_03_25,You always want to do so much for us.
m_ex_emma_03_26,I can see why you'd feel anxious about reaching your goal.
m_ex_emma_03_27,How about this?
m_ex_emma_03_28,Think about the big picture!
m_ex_emma_03_29,What do you mean?
m_ex_emma_03_30,"Before I tell you,"
m_ex_emma_03_31,let me ask you something.
m_ex_emma_03_32,How has the last year been?
m_ex_emma_03_33,It was eventful.
m_ex_emma_03_34,It was all a blur.
m_ex_emma_03_35,Exactly!
m_ex_emma_03_36,You've always been running around like a headless chicken
m_ex_emma_03_37,ever since you were commissioned.
m_ex_emma_03_38,"What's more, one of your comrades was injured."
m_ex_emma_03_39,You must have been through things too painful to recollect
m_ex_emma_03_40,but I'm sure there must be lots of happy memories as well!
m_ex_emma_03_41,You're right.
m_ex_emma_03_42,Precisely!
m_ex_emma_03_43,"All of that made up your year, both the good and the bad."
m_ex_emma_03_44,Think about it.
m_ex_emma_03_45,If you take it easy for just one day
m_ex_emma_03_46,"and just kick back for once,"
m_ex_emma_03_47,it won't affect what you've achieved over the course of a year.
m_ex_emma_03_48,"If you look at the bigger picture, it won't make a difference at all!"
m_ex_emma_03_49,"On the other hand, if you run yourself ragged,"
m_ex_emma_03_50,you may end up doing irreparable damage to your mind and body.
m_ex_emma_03_51,I only wish to take care of you
m_ex_emma_03_52,like the way you've taken care of us.
m_ex_emma_03_53,"All right, I'll take better care of myself."
m_ex_emma_03_54,"Brilliant, hehe!"
m_ex_emma_03_55,I'll drop by your room later to make sure
m_ex_emma_03_56,you're not burning the midnight oil again!
m_ex_emma_03_57,"If I catch you working overtime, you'll be in big trouble!  >:("
m_ex_emma_03_58,Thank you for always taking care of me.
m_ex_emma_03_59,It's nothing! Hehe.
m_ex_emma_03_60,"You're always so good to us,"
m_ex_emma_03_61,so I'm just returning the favor.
m_ex_emma_03_62,Have a good day! ^___^
m_ex_epinel_01_1,Hey there.
m_ex_epinel_01_2,Is this Coach?
m_ex_epinel_01_3,That's right.
m_ex_epinel_01_4,"I was just thinking that since we're teamed up now,"
m_ex_epinel_01_5,I may need to speak to you.
m_ex_epinel_01_6,I'm looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_epinel_01_7,Likewise.
m_ex_epinel_01_8,Well...
m_ex_epinel_01_9,What else should I say?
m_ex_epinel_01_10,I'm a Nikke in sports entertainment
m_ex_epinel_01_11,and mostly skate using a skateboard.
m_ex_epinel_01_12,It really depends on the weather. Sometimes I'll skate on a snowboard or a surfboard.
m_ex_epinel_01_13,So you're a pro skater.
m_ex_epinel_01_14,You're such a sporting all-rounder.
m_ex_epinel_01_15,If you say so.
m_ex_epinel_01_16,I'm the kind of Nikke who's made that way.
m_ex_epinel_01_17,"Anyway, looking forward to working with you."
m_ex_epinel_01_18,"Oh right, one more thing."
m_ex_epinel_01_19,"If there are any letters from kids or something else sent to the dorm,"
m_ex_epinel_01_20,just send it to my room.
m_ex_epinel_01_21,They are probably from my fans.
m_ex_epinel_01_22,Your fans?
m_ex_epinel_01_23,Yes.
m_ex_epinel_01_24,"After all, my sport is for younger people."
m_ex_epinel_01_25,My fans are mostly kids or teens.
m_ex_epinel_01_26,"Actually, there have been like 20 letters sent to the dorm."
m_ex_epinel_01_27,Really?
m_ex_epinel_01_28,They're so quick.
m_ex_epinel_01_29,Thanks for telling me.
m_ex_epinel_01_30,I'll go get them now.
m_ex_epinel_01_31,I put all the letters together so that Epinel can take them easily.
m_ex_epinel_02_1,Coach
m_ex_epinel_02_2,I'll be participating in a skateboarding competition tomorrow.
m_ex_epinel_02_3,Do you want to come?
m_ex_epinel_02_4,"Sorry, but I have plans."
m_ex_epinel_02_5,I've got something important to take care of tomorrow.
m_ex_epinel_02_6,Okay...
m_ex_epinel_02_7,I figured as much.
m_ex_epinel_02_8,I guess
m_ex_epinel_02_9,I'll just have to take a rain check.
m_ex_epinel_02_10,"Besides, there will be more competitions in the future."
m_ex_epinel_02_11,Wait
m_ex_epinel_02_12,Yeah?
m_ex_epinel_02_13,Send me a video when you're done.
m_ex_epinel_02_14,Sure.
m_ex_epinel_02_15,If you search for my name on Tetra Net
m_ex_epinel_02_16,"after the competition ends,"
m_ex_epinel_02_17,you should be able to find videos my fans shot.
m_ex_epinel_02_18,But why?
m_ex_epinel_02_19,Because I'm a fan of yours.
m_ex_epinel_02_20,Wouldn't want to miss your spectacular moment!
m_ex_epinel_02_21,Huh?
m_ex_epinel_02_22,Since when?
m_ex_epinel_02_23,Ever since I saw you skateboard for the first time.
m_ex_epinel_02_24,Ever since you first hit the scene.
m_ex_epinel_02_25,??
m_ex_epinel_02_26,No way...
m_ex_epinel_02_27,You certainly never showed it! Haha
m_ex_epinel_02_28,"Well, if that's how you feel,"
m_ex_epinel_02_29,be sure to come to see me live next time.
m_ex_epinel_02_30,What are you on about? Haha
m_ex_epinel_02_31,"I'm gonna have a spectacular lifetime, not just a moment!"
m_ex_epinel_02_32,"Anyway, be sure to come to see me live next time."
m_ex_epinel_02_33,"Although fans capture some awesome footage nowadays,"
m_ex_epinel_02_34,it still can't compare to watching it live.
m_ex_epinel_02_35,Also...
m_ex_epinel_02_36,"if you come to watch,"
m_ex_epinel_02_37,I feel like I'll be able to pull off even cooler tricks.
m_ex_epinel_02_38,I'll make sure to be there next time.
m_ex_epinel_02_39,All right!
m_ex_epinel_02_40,It's a deal then.
m_ex_epinel_02_41,"I've got this new trick that makes the crowd go wild,"
m_ex_epinel_02_42,so I'm dying to show it to you live.
m_ex_epinel_02_43,Can't wait to see it.
m_ex_epinel_02_44,"All right,"
m_ex_epinel_02_45,I'm off to practice then.
m_ex_epinel_02_46,Don't work too hard.
m_ex_epinel_02_47,Sure thing.
m_ex_epinel_02_48,"... When the tasks are done tomorrow, let's search for Epinel on Tetra Net."
m_ex_epinel_03_1,"Coach,"
m_ex_epinel_03_2,have you heard of the show Ark Rangers?
m_ex_epinel_03_3,Sure.
m_ex_epinel_03_4,So...
m_ex_epinel_03_5,what do you think of it?
m_ex_epinel_03_6,I like it
m_ex_epinel_03_7,I don't really like it
m_ex_epinel_03_8,Cool!
m_ex_epinel_03_9,"Actually, I wanted to ask you something."
m_ex_epinel_03_10,Oh really?
m_ex_epinel_03_11,That's a shame.
m_ex_epinel_03_12,I have something I'd like to ask you.
m_ex_epinel_03_13,What is it?
m_ex_epinel_03_14,A lot of fans have been pointing out lately
m_ex_epinel_03_15,that I look like one of the characters from Ark Rangers.
m_ex_epinel_03_16,They're saying I should
m_ex_epinel_03_17,come up with some tricks
m_ex_epinel_03_18,that have something to do with this character.
m_ex_epinel_03_19,I contacted you because
m_ex_epinel_03_20,I was wondering if you knew the character.
m_ex_epinel_03_21,What's the character's name?
m_ex_epinel_03_22,Bl...
m_ex_epinel_03_23,Hmm...
m_ex_epinel_03_24,Black? Blue? I think?
m_ex_epinel_03_25,Is it a popular character?
m_ex_epinel_03_26,Yeah.
m_ex_epinel_03_27,That would be Black.
m_ex_epinel_03_28,"Wow, you really are familiar with the show!"
m_ex_epinel_03_29,But what about Blue...?
m_ex_epinel_03_30,All right.
m_ex_epinel_03_31,I see what you're saying.
m_ex_epinel_03_32,What is the skill called?
m_ex_epinel_03_33,What was it again? Rider...
m_ex_epinel_03_34,Rider Ark Flash?
m_ex_epinel_03_35,That's it
m_ex_epinel_03_36,or something along that line.
m_ex_epinel_03_37,"Woah,"
m_ex_epinel_03_38,you're practically a superfan!
m_ex_epinel_03_39,I wouldn't go that far.
m_ex_epinel_03_40,"I don't know,"
m_ex_epinel_03_41,you seem to know an awful lot about the show.
m_ex_epinel_03_42,"So, what do you think?"
m_ex_epinel_03_43,Do you think it'd be something I can incorporate into a trick?
m_ex_epinel_03_44,You can't go wrong with Ark Ranger.
m_ex_epinel_03_45,Black is always the way to go.
m_ex_epinel_03_46,!!
m_ex_epinel_03_47,So you feel the same as they do...
m_ex_epinel_03_48,Hmm...
m_ex_epinel_03_49,All right.
m_ex_epinel_03_50,It's worth a try.
m_ex_epinel_03_51,Guess it's time I catch up on some Ark Rangers.
m_ex_epinel_03_52,Have fun!
m_ex_epinel_03_53,I will!
m_ex_ether_01_1,"Hi, No.7!"
m_ex_ether_01_2,"From now on, I will go to the surface with you,"
m_ex_ether_01_3,if you'd let me.
m_ex_ether_01_4,We'll go on assignments
m_ex_ether_01_5,"and do all kinds of random stuff together, right?"
m_ex_ether_01_6,That's all.
m_ex_ether_01_7,Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
m_ex_ether_01_8,Well... That's because
m_ex_ether_01_9,the people up there are bored or something.
m_ex_ether_01_10,I'm asked to send
m_ex_ether_01_11,my Commander
m_ex_ether_01_12,a message saying that I'll be with you.
m_ex_ether_01_13,They say it's a kind of new procedure or something.
m_ex_ether_01_14,Ugh... Just thinking about that
m_ex_ether_01_15,makes me wanna quit my job.
m_ex_ether_01_16,"If it's really that upsetting, you don't have to follow it."
m_ex_ether_01_17,"Nope, that's impossible."
m_ex_ether_01_18,"Since I'm working in the office,"
m_ex_ether_01_19,shouldn't I be following the rules?
m_ex_ether_01_20,There are consequences to not following procedures.
m_ex_ether_01_21,"So it's better for me to send you a message, isn't it? :)"
m_ex_ether_01_22,I appreciate it.
m_ex_ether_01_23,It's no big deal.
m_ex_ether_01_24,"Besides, I wouldn't call it troublesome"
m_ex_ether_01_25,"since I get to be in touch with you, No. 7."
m_ex_ether_01_26,"I mean, it depends."
m_ex_ether_01_27,It wouldn't be bad if I saw a funny guinea pig :3
m_ex_ether_01_28,So should I be thanking you?
m_ex_ether_01_29,"Well, I don't think so?"
m_ex_ether_01_30,"Ah, I'm sleepy."
m_ex_ether_01_31,Hmm...
m_ex_ether_01_32,"I'm feeling sleepier after typing the word ""sleepy."""
m_ex_ether_01_33,I have to go.
m_ex_ether_01_34,It's going to be more of a problem if I get sleepy.
m_ex_ether_01_35,No more replies starting now ;)
m_ex_ether_01_36,That quick?
m_ex_ether_01_37,"Yep, that's it. Don't reply to me again!"
m_ex_ether_01_38,I'm so tired already. I don't want to type anymore.
m_ex_ether_01_39,Bye!
m_ex_ether_02_1,"No. 7, what are you doing?"
m_ex_ether_02_2,Are you busy?
m_ex_ether_02_3,What's up?
m_ex_ether_02_4,"Nothing much, really."
m_ex_ether_02_5,I'm bored is all.
m_ex_ether_02_6,Something's not right...
m_ex_ether_02_7,"Hey, c'mon!"
m_ex_ether_02_8,I reach out to you because I'm bored
m_ex_ether_02_9,and you start attacking me right off the bat!
m_ex_ether_02_10,I'm hurt!
m_ex_ether_02_11,Does M.M.R. even have the time to be bored?
m_ex_ether_02_12,!!
m_ex_ether_02_13,My oh my!
m_ex_ether_02_14,You're really on your game today!
m_ex_ether_02_15,"You haven't been taking brain boosters on the sly, have you?"
m_ex_ether_02_16,It doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.
m_ex_ether_02_17,"All right, fair enough."
m_ex_ether_02_18,I didn't realize you were so perceptive.
m_ex_ether_02_19,My apologies.
m_ex_ether_02_20,"Since you're so smart already,"
m_ex_ether_02_21,my medicine will make you even smarter.
m_ex_ether_02_22,Medicine?
m_ex_ether_02_23,"It actually isn't medicine per se,"
m_ex_ether_02_24,but it's more like supplements.
m_ex_ether_02_25,Does that sound any better?
m_ex_ether_02_26,I won't take it even if it's a supplement.
m_ex_ether_02_27,Why not? Just try one?
m_ex_ether_02_28,It'll help improve your memory.
m_ex_ether_02_29,I ran a bunch of tests.
m_ex_ether_02_30,"Out of everyone I could choose,"
m_ex_ether_02_31,you're the lucky recipient for this wonder drug... um... supplement!
m_ex_ether_02_32,Are there any side effects?
m_ex_ether_02_33,Side effects?
m_ex_ether_02_34,Of course...
m_ex_ether_02_35,there are :)
m_ex_ether_02_36,I won't take it.
m_ex_ether_02_37,All you'll get is a little nosebleed
m_ex_ether_02_38,and feel a bit light-headed twice a day.
m_ex_ether_02_39,"In exchange, it'll allow you to stay awake for longer periods."
m_ex_ether_02_40,"Not a bad trade-off, wouldn't you say?"
m_ex_ether_02_41,That's not becoming smarter.
m_ex_ether_02_42,"If you can stay awake longer,"
m_ex_ether_02_43,you can invest that time into acquiring more knowledge.
m_ex_ether_02_44,"Ergo, you'll become smarter!"
m_ex_ether_02_45,I still won't take it
m_ex_ether_02_46,Sigh... too bad.
m_ex_ether_02_47,I thought someone like you with long-term goals
m_ex_ether_02_48,would find the notion
m_ex_ether_02_49,of staying up longer enticing.
m_ex_ether_02_50,I figured the whole 'making you smarter' thing wasn't so important.
m_ex_ether_02_51,"I must admit, I didn't see this coming."
m_ex_ether_02_52,"If you ended up getting a nosebleed,"
m_ex_ether_02_53,I was going to take you into my cozy little lab
m_ex_ether_02_54,under the pretext of you contracting a strange disease up on the surface.
m_ex_ether_02_55,!!
m_ex_ether_02_56,"Much to my dismay, you're a crafty little one today! :)"
m_ex_ether_02_57,"Oh well,"
m_ex_ether_02_58,I'll just have to try again next time :3
m_ex_ether_02_59,Please don't.
m_ex_ether_02_60,We'll see :)
m_ex_ether_03_1,No. 7!
m_ex_ether_03_2,"No. 7!! No. 7, No. 7, No. 7!"
m_ex_ether_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_ether_03_4,"Wow, you're actually here."
m_ex_ether_03_5,What are you doing right now?
m_ex_ether_03_6,Just texting.
m_ex_ether_03_7,Oh yeah?
m_ex_ether_03_8,With whom?
m_ex_ether_03_9,You.
m_ex_ether_03_10,Just some dangerous researcher.
m_ex_ether_03_11,I see :)
m_ex_ether_03_12,If you're texting...
m_ex_ether_03_13,You don't say...
m_ex_ether_03_14,"I'm not sure whom you're referring to,"
m_ex_ether_03_15,but if you're texting...
m_ex_ether_03_16,"that means you must have free time on your hands, right?"
m_ex_ether_03_17,"Actually, not really."
m_ex_ether_03_18,"Somehow,"
m_ex_ether_03_19,I don't believe you.
m_ex_ether_03_20,"You're not becoming a shut-in by any chance, are you?"
m_ex_ether_03_21,A shut-in?
m_ex_ether_03_22,"Yeah, a big ol' lazybones"
m_ex_ether_03_23,who doesn't want to go out and meet people! :P
m_ex_ether_03_24,"Yes, I am"
m_ex_ether_03_25,"No, I'm not"
m_ex_ether_03_26,Oh dear...
m_ex_ether_03_27,What should I do?
m_ex_ether_03_28,I'm rather lazy myself.
m_ex_ether_03_29,Perhaps even more so than you.
m_ex_ether_03_30,So let me tell you how annoying that is!
m_ex_ether_03_31,Phew...
m_ex_ether_03_32,That's a relief!
m_ex_ether_03_33,I'm feeling rather lazy myself right now.
m_ex_ether_03_34,So this works out nicely.
m_ex_ether_03_35,Buy me some stockings.
m_ex_ether_03_36,"I have to attend a seminar with my superiors soon,"
m_ex_ether_03_37,and I ripped my stockings again.
m_ex_ether_03_38,"If I go dressed like this,"
m_ex_ether_03_39,I'll never hear the end of it.
m_ex_ether_03_40,Isn't there anywhere nearby that sells stockings?
m_ex_ether_03_41,Nope.
m_ex_ether_03_42,"Actually, there's apparently a vending machine next to the lab that sells them"
m_ex_ether_03_43,but I'm too lazy to go :)
m_ex_ether_03_44,Can you do it for me?
m_ex_ether_03_45,No
m_ex_ether_03_46,Why nooooot?
m_ex_ether_03_47,"If you want, I'll pay you."
m_ex_ether_03_48,!!
m_ex_ether_03_49,Consider it payment for services rendered.
m_ex_ether_03_50,Just buy them and bring them to me.
m_ex_ether_03_51,How about it?
m_ex_ether_03_52,You'd really rather spend money than get them yourself?
m_ex_ether_03_53,You betcha.
m_ex_ether_03_54,Also...
m_ex_ether_03_55,"if I have you do it,"
m_ex_ether_03_56,I'll get to see your face!
m_ex_ether_03_57,"Who knows, maybe you'll"
m_ex_ether_03_58,cozy up next to my lab table.
m_ex_ether_03_59,I won't go.
m_ex_ether_03_60,"Aw, c'mon! Pretty please? :)"
m_ex_ether_03_61,You can earn some quick cash.
m_ex_ether_03_62,I still won't go.
m_ex_ether_03_63,"Hmph, you're no fun today."
m_ex_ether_03_64,Oh well :)
m_ex_ether_03_65,I'm too lazy to spend time
m_ex_ether_03_66,trying to convince Commander Sourpuss to get stockings.
m_ex_ether_03_67,I'll have to convince Mana to bring them to me.
m_ex_ether_03_68,Until next time.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_1,I've received instructions from upper-class leaders to meet you.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_2,I'm the leader of the Absolute.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_3,My name is Eunhwa.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_4,Nice to meet you. I hope we can get along with each other.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_5,Save your words.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_6,"Once again, I'm only here because of my superiors' order."
m_ex_eunhwa_01_7,It's not because I respect a weakling like you.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_8,A weakling?
m_ex_eunhwa_01_9,You know what I mean.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_10,"99% of the Commanders,"
m_ex_eunhwa_01_11,"who graduated from the military academy, are stupid."
m_ex_eunhwa_01_12,It's just some simple probability calculations.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_13,Then I am a part of the 1%.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_14,Go ahead and brag about yourself.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_15,"If you want me to respect you as a Commander,"
m_ex_eunhwa_01_16,you have to prove yourself with your ability and earn it.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_17,"Until then, don't talk to me under any circumstances."
m_ex_eunhwa_01_18,It's just a waste of time.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_19,I can prove myself.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_20,I will make you acknowledge me sooner or later.
m_ex_eunhwa_01_21,The message has not been read...
m_ex_eunhwa_02_1,"Tell me,"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_2,what is your favorite food?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_3,What is that?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_4,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_02_5,Don't make me ask twice.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_6,Speak.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_7,Any food that's made with care.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_8,I like food with meat in it
m_ex_eunhwa_02_9,Anything?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_10,Meat?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_11,Your answer is too vague.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_12,I should have known.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_13,"Ask a moron a question, and you'll get a moronic answer."
m_ex_eunhwa_02_14,"If I don't give her more information, I feel she's going to keep needling me."
m_ex_eunhwa_02_15,Braised Nutrium
m_ex_eunhwa_02_16,Medium rare Nutrium steak
m_ex_eunhwa_02_17,Good
m_ex_eunhwa_02_18,That's more like it.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_19,Why do you ask?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_20,Are you planning on cooking for me?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_21,I got a request.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_22,"Otherwise, I wouldn't even be contacting you in the first place =.="
m_ex_eunhwa_02_23,What do you mean by request?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_24,"Emma has been pestering me for days now,"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_25,so I finally caved.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_26,?!@!!#
m_ex_eunhwa_02_27,Keep your ramblings to yourself.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_28,I'm only asking on Emma's behalf.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_29,"So not a word of this to her,"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_30,or else.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_31,Wait!
m_ex_eunhwa_02_32,?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_33,Emma already knows what type of food I like.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_34,What?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_35,She asked me personally a couple of days ago.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_36,...
m_ex_eunhwa_02_37,Why on earth did she have me do this then?
m_ex_eunhwa_02_38,To improve our relationship
m_ex_eunhwa_02_39,She's making a nice team-building exercise out of it.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_40,???
m_ex_eunhwa_02_41,Sigh...
m_ex_eunhwa_02_42,"Emma may have a screw loose,"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_43,but you're even worse for stringing me along like that.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_44,You better keep a tight leash on Emma from here on out.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_45,I don't want to waste more of my time
m_ex_eunhwa_02_46,messaging knuckleheads like you on blabla.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_47,"Well, don't you have anything to say?"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_48,I'll do that.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_49,"If you understood,"
m_ex_eunhwa_02_50,you'd keep your mouth shut.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_51,You spoke first...
m_ex_eunhwa_02_52,...
m_ex_eunhwa_02_53,Shut up!
m_ex_eunhwa_02_54,There are no further messages from Eunhwa.
m_ex_eunhwa_02_55,I'll have to thank Emma later.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_1,"Tell me, small fry"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_2,what on earth is going on here at the Outpost?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_3,???
m_ex_eunhwa_03_4,Why do these pathetic Nikkes
m_ex_eunhwa_03_5,lack so much discipline?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_6,"A stiff wind could blow them over,"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_7,"yet rather than training, they stand and joke amongst themselves"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_8,or cause a ruckus by lighting off fireworks.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_9,Seems like you met the Carronades.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_10,They're not the only problem.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_11,This entire place is practically festering with indolence.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_12,The Outpost has always been that way.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_13,What is that?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_14,Always?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_15,"Yes, the Outpost may be a lightning rod"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_16,"for slugs like yourselves,"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_17,but isn't it still a military base?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_18,Being on edge 24/7 isn't necessarily a good thing.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_19,Tsk
m_ex_eunhwa_03_20,"Here I was, wondering"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_21,how come the Nikkes here are about as useful as a can opener.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_22,Turns out their so-called Commander is the laziest of them all.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_23,"Pull yourself together,"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_24,weakling.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_25,Do you even realize what it means
m_ex_eunhwa_03_26,to have the surface right in your backyard?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_27,"You'll never know when and how you may be under attack,"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_28,yet here you are spewing nonsense about how
m_ex_eunhwa_03_29,it's unnecessary to stay on your toes.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_30,This is a dereliction of duty!
m_ex_eunhwa_03_31,It's so pathetic that I can't watch.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_32,Are you worried about us?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_33,(Inappropriate language detected. Unable to send SMS.)
m_ex_eunhwa_03_34,"Weakling,"
m_ex_eunhwa_03_35,just when I thought you couldn't barf out any more nonsensical drivel.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_36,Your idiocy never ceases to amaze me.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_37,I'll be more alert so that we're prepared for any surprise attacks.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_38,...
m_ex_eunhwa_03_39,(Inappropriate language detected. Unable to send SMS.)
m_ex_eunhwa_03_40,I shouldn't have expected anything from you.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_41,And you call yourself a commander...
m_ex_eunhwa_03_42,Bah!
m_ex_eunhwa_03_43,Do whatever you want!
m_ex_eunhwa_03_44,Thank you for caring.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_45,What are you going on about?
m_ex_eunhwa_03_46,Shut up
m_ex_eunhwa_03_47,Don't talk to me.
m_ex_eunhwa_03_48,There are no further messages from Eunhwa.
m_ex_exia_01_1,Hey.
m_ex_exia_01_2,"By any chance,"
m_ex_exia_01_3,do you play Dragon Fantasy?
m_ex_exia_01_4,Yes.
m_ex_exia_01_5,Oh.
m_ex_exia_01_6,What's your progress?
m_ex_exia_01_7,Do you know the part where Rino dies?
m_ex_exia_01_8,Stop spoiling the game!
m_ex_exia_01_9,Ah.
m_ex_exia_01_10,Sorry.
m_ex_exia_01_11,"I was too excited, and"
m_ex_exia_01_12,it's been a while since I saw a noob in DF.
m_ex_exia_01_13,??
m_ex_exia_01_14,"I mean, DF is quite an old game,"
m_ex_exia_01_15,and there are no noobs here.
m_ex_exia_01_16,"Even worse is the situation of new players being attracted by the launch of FQ online,"
m_ex_exia_01_17,so no one remained :/
m_ex_exia_01_18,"But recently,"
m_ex_exia_01_19,"I heard that there's a noob in DF,"
m_ex_exia_01_20,that's why I contacted you.
m_ex_exia_01_21,Aha.
m_ex_exia_01_22,I can't say it's to make up for spoiling the game for you...
m_ex_exia_01_23,but do you want me to carry you?
m_ex_exia_01_24,I can bring you to the maximum level in just 3 days.
m_ex_exia_01_25,YES.
m_ex_exia_01_26,Nice.
m_ex_exia_01_27,Let me know your ID.
m_ex_exia_01_28,Boiled Egg
m_ex_exia_01_29,Firepower Energizer
m_ex_exia_01_30,"Okay, I have added you."
m_ex_exia_01_31,Can you log in now?
m_ex_exia_01_32,Sure.
m_ex_exia_01_33,Then let's start.
m_ex_exia_01_34,"Just sit back and relax,"
m_ex_exia_01_35,I will take you to the end.
m_ex_exia_02_1,Noob!
m_ex_exia_02_2,"Noob, noob!"
m_ex_exia_02_3,Something's wrong...
m_ex_exia_02_4,What happened?
m_ex_exia_02_5,"I need to meet someone soon,"
m_ex_exia_02_6,but something came up at work
m_ex_exia_02_7,and I don't think I can leave.
m_ex_exia_02_8,Can you go instead?
m_ex_exia_02_9,Who do you need to meet?
m_ex_exia_02_10,It's this kid in the Ark
m_ex_exia_02_11,"who goes by the nickname ""Cockadoodledoo""."
m_ex_exia_02_12,We're supposed to meet in 30 minutes.
m_ex_exia_02_13,What do I need to do when I meet him?
m_ex_exia_02_14,I'm pretty sure he's just a kid
m_ex_exia_02_15,so just give him a good scare!
m_ex_exia_02_16,???
m_ex_exia_02_17,It's nothing.
m_ex_exia_02_18,"We're gaming buddies,"
m_ex_exia_02_19,"but during an important raid,"
m_ex_exia_02_20,I was the first to get killed!
m_ex_exia_02_21,That wouldn't have happened if he'd had my back!
m_ex_exia_02_22,"I was pretty peeved, so we were getting into it in the chat,"
m_ex_exia_02_23,and eventually decided to duke it out face-to-face.
m_ex_exia_02_24,Grrr...
m_ex_exia_02_25,I still can't believe it.
m_ex_exia_02_26,They should have covered me so the deal could go down!
m_ex_exia_02_27,Am I crazy for thinking this?
m_ex_exia_02_28,You should have closed all your deals before you died.
m_ex_exia_02_29,Where was your healer?
m_ex_exia_02_30,Sigh...
m_ex_exia_02_31,"You've got a point,"
m_ex_exia_02_32,"I was on a roll, so maybe I was acting recklessly."
m_ex_exia_02_33,"Actually, I've got no beef with this kid."
m_ex_exia_02_34,It's solo raids for me from now on.
m_ex_exia_02_35,Hey!
m_ex_exia_02_36,You're right!
m_ex_exia_02_37,The healer was right beside me twiddling his thumbs.
m_ex_exia_02_38,I shouldn't be fighting this kid
m_ex_exia_02_39,What was that healer's nickname again?
m_ex_exia_02_40,Anyway...
m_ex_exia_02_41,I think we can call off the duel for now.
m_ex_exia_02_42,"Way to use your noggin,"
m_ex_exia_02_43,noob!
m_ex_exia_03_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_exia_03_2,can you help with me an experiment?
m_ex_exia_03_3,What kind of experiment?
m_ex_exia_03_4,"Oh, nothing too crazy."
m_ex_exia_03_5,I'm just testing to see
m_ex_exia_03_6,how far a device can be controlled remotely
m_ex_exia_03_7,just by clicking a link
m_ex_exia_03_8,and downloading a small file.
m_ex_exia_03_9,"So basically, you're making a hacking tool."
m_ex_exia_03_10,"Sure, I'm game."
m_ex_exia_03_11,No!
m_ex_exia_03_12,It's nothing like that!
m_ex_exia_03_13,This is just
m_ex_exia_03_14,a kindly gesture for Nikkes
m_ex_exia_03_15,who don't know their way around cell phones.
m_ex_exia_03_16,"Y'know, like Novel and Ludmilla."
m_ex_exia_03_17,Excellent.
m_ex_exia_03_18,"I figured you'd cooperate,"
m_ex_exia_03_19,no questions asked.
m_ex_exia_03_20,What do you mean?
m_ex_exia_03_21,It's a compliment!
m_ex_exia_03_22,genioustest.com/hacker-cracker-tpk/download?from=details
m_ex_exia_03_23,Just click on this link.
m_ex_exia_03_24,I clicked on the link.
m_ex_exia_03_25,Downloading the file Hacker-Cracker.
m_ex_exia_03_26,33%... 67%... 100%.
m_ex_exia_03_27,Download complete.
m_ex_exia_03_28,Good
m_ex_exia_03_29,"Now, let me just test a couple of things."
m_ex_exia_03_30,Ok
m_ex_exia_03_31,Can you give me a short self-introduction?
m_ex_exia_03_32,Noob Noob Noobnoobnoob Nooobbb
m_ex_exia_03_33,?!
m_ex_exia_03_34,Something's not right!
m_ex_exia_03_35,It's typing on its own!
m_ex_exia_03_36,"I am a competent Commander. Starting today, I'm going to give all Nikkes 1 piece of Nutrium per day."
m_ex_exia_03_37,...?!
m_ex_exia_03_38,"I looked in the mirror this morning, and found that I'm so darn sexy that it ought to be a crime."
m_ex_exia_03_39,This isn't right!
m_ex_exia_03_40,The cellphone freezes.
m_ex_exia_03_41,"I like all Nikes, but Exia is at the top of the list ♡"
m_ex_exia_03_42,Okiedokie
m_ex_exia_03_43,That should do it.
m_ex_exia_03_44,Hard to refute anything you said there!
m_ex_exia_03_45,I'm touched by how open you were
m_ex_exia_03_46,so I took some screenshots.
m_ex_exia_03_47,Why are you doing thi...
m_ex_exia_03_48,You've finally regained control.
m_ex_exia_03_49,This is too good! It'd be a crime not to share it with others.
m_ex_exia_03_50,Thanks for your cooperation!
m_ex_exia_03_51,What exactly was that experiment for?
m_ex_exia_03_52,There is no reply from Exia.
m_ex_folkwang_01_1,"Yeouch! Hot, hot, hot!"
m_ex_folkwang_01_2,My phone is overheating.
m_ex_folkwang_01_3,"Sorry, it was so hot that I forgot to say hello! :P"
m_ex_folkwang_01_4,Hi there.
m_ex_folkwang_01_5,Hi.
m_ex_folkwang_01_6,I'm Folkwang from Nepenthe.
m_ex_folkwang_01_7,Do you suffer from excessive perspiration by any chance?
m_ex_folkwang_01_8,No more than any other person.
m_ex_folkwang_01_9,"Aw man, I envy you!"
m_ex_folkwang_01_10,"I've been loading up on Ice Splendamin and supplements,"
m_ex_folkwang_01_11,but that hasn't changed a thing.
m_ex_folkwang_01_12,"Tell me, what does not sweating feel like?"
m_ex_folkwang_01_13,It sounds like it'd feel so... clean.
m_ex_folkwang_01_14,"The more I think about it, the more I envy you, and that only turns on the spigot more."
m_ex_folkwang_01_15,What do you usually do when you're sweating a lot?
m_ex_folkwang_01_16,"If you have any tips, I'd love to hear them."
m_ex_folkwang_01_17,I just take off my clothes all day long.
m_ex_folkwang_01_18,I'd soak myself in some cool water all day long.
m_ex_folkwang_01_19,"Woah... sorry, but that just made me sweat even more."
m_ex_folkwang_01_20,Just thinking about cool water on my skin... makes me sweat even more.
m_ex_folkwang_01_21,"It's a good idea, but not very feasible to do all day every day."
m_ex_folkwang_01_22,"If you happen to think of any ideas in the future, please let me know."
m_ex_folkwang_01_23,Sure.
m_ex_folkwang_01_24,"Ugh, it's time!"
m_ex_folkwang_01_25,Nutritional supplements are on sale! I gotta go!
m_ex_folkwang_01_26,A sale?
m_ex_folkwang_01_27,"Yeah, there's this great supplement that improves your constitution,"
m_ex_folkwang_01_28,and it's sold at half price today!
m_ex_folkwang_01_29,It's always sold out every time I try to buy it :(
m_ex_folkwang_01_30,So I really need to buy some today!
m_ex_folkwang_01_31,Want me to buy some for you too?
m_ex_folkwang_01_32,"Thanks, but no thanks."
m_ex_folkwang_01_33,"Okay. After all, I may not even be able to buy enough for myself..."
m_ex_folkwang_01_34,"If I can snag some, I'll let you know how it turns out after I take them."
m_ex_folkwang_01_35,"Oh man, the sale's gonna start any minute now! Gotta go."
m_ex_folkwang_01_36,It was nice talking with you!
m_ex_folkwang_02_1,;;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_2,;;;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_3,??
m_ex_folkwang_02_4,;;;;;;;;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_5,What's with all the semicolons?
m_ex_folkwang_02_6,Huh? What the heck is going on?
m_ex_folkwang_02_7,I'm not sending those;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_8,They make it look like my phone's sweating too!
m_ex_folkwang_02_9,I see.
m_ex_folkwang_02_10,"Coach, are you busy?"
m_ex_folkwang_02_11,No.
m_ex_folkwang_02_12,Could you help me pick out a swimsuit?
m_ex_folkwang_02_13,Swimsuit?
m_ex_folkwang_02_14,"Yeah. The past few days have been real scorchers,"
m_ex_folkwang_02_15,so I want to dunk myself in the pool on days when we have no training sessions.
m_ex_folkwang_02_16,But I'm not sure what kind of swimsuit I should buy;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_17,Rash guard.
m_ex_folkwang_02_18,Bikini.
m_ex_folkwang_02_19,A rash guard?
m_ex_folkwang_02_20,"I feel like I'd still be burning up wearing that, even in cold water;;;"
m_ex_folkwang_02_21,"I was leaning towards a bikini too,"
m_ex_folkwang_02_22,but I heard two-pieces are forbidden;;;
m_ex_folkwang_02_23,I'll play it safe and go with a one piece.
m_ex_folkwang_02_24,Are you still taking those supplements?
m_ex_folkwang_02_25,As if you had to ask!
m_ex_folkwang_02_26,They're a must!
m_ex_folkwang_02_27,"They introduced a new one, and I've got it as well."
m_ex_folkwang_02_28,What kind?
m_ex_folkwang_02_29,"Apparently, they're able to reduce your body temperature"
m_ex_folkwang_02_30,if you take some before swimming.
m_ex_folkwang_02_31,"Since I just want to try them out, I went with ten boxes."
m_ex_folkwang_02_32,Ten boxes?
m_ex_folkwang_02_33,That's only enough for one month.
m_ex_folkwang_02_34,"If they end up working, I'll send you some!"
m_ex_folkwang_02_35,No thanks.
m_ex_folkwang_02_36,Aw c'mon! Give it a shot!
m_ex_folkwang_02_37,Nope.
m_ex_folkwang_02_38,"Gosh, it's really sweltering today;;;"
m_ex_folkwang_02_39,I can't take it anymore! I've gotta go take a dip.
m_ex_folkwang_02_40,"I'll catch you later, Coach."
m_ex_folkwang_03_1,Coach.
m_ex_folkwang_03_2,Coach :'(
m_ex_folkwang_03_3,What's the matter?
m_ex_folkwang_03_4,How's your afsn?
m_ex_folkwang_03_5,So sweaty... even my phone is slippery...
m_ex_folkwang_03_6,???
m_ex_folkwang_03_7,My fan broke down.
m_ex_folkwang_03_8,I feel like I'm dying.
m_ex_folkwang_03_9,I can't stop sweating T^T
m_ex_folkwang_03_10,Have it fixed at the Workshop.
m_ex_folkwang_03_11,"That's the first place I went to,"
m_ex_folkwang_03_12,but they're all out on a business trip. So no one can fix it.
m_ex_folkwang_03_13,"Pleasea, can you hlwp me? T^T"
m_ex_folkwang_03_14,I'll ask the supermarket to deliver a new fan to you right away.
m_ex_folkwang_03_15,"Right, the supermarket!"
m_ex_folkwang_03_16,I didn't think about that. I knew I could count on you!
m_ex_folkwang_03_17,You just saved the day.
m_ex_folkwang_03_18,When can I expect the new fan?
m_ex_folkwang_03_19,"I feel like I'm gonna melt, and I'm not exaggerating!"
m_ex_folkwang_03_20,I just ordered it.
m_ex_folkwang_03_21,Already?!
m_ex_folkwang_03_22,I'm sure you'll get it before you pass out.
m_ex_folkwang_03_23,Great!
m_ex_folkwang_03_24,I'm gonna have some ice cream
m_ex_folkwang_03_25,so I can hold out longer!
m_ex_folkwang_03_26,"Thanks, Coach!"
m_ex_frima_01_1,Hey!
m_ex_frima_01_2,Hey?
m_ex_frima_01_3,Hey.
m_ex_frima_01_4,Yes.
m_ex_frima_01_5,Hey.
m_ex_frima_01_6,Interesting.
m_ex_frima_01_7,Are you calling me 'hey'?
m_ex_frima_01_8,Yes.
m_ex_frima_01_9,Message.
m_ex_frima_01_10,Too.
m_ex_frima_01_11,Annoying.
m_ex_frima_01_12,Then you don't have to message.
m_ex_frima_01_13,Oh
m_ex_frima_01_14,Right.
m_ex_frima_01_15,Hey.

m_ex_frima_02_9,You want coffee with cream for delivery?
m_ex_frima_02_10,You want me to deliver coffee with cream to someone else?
m_ex_frima_02_11,No
m_ex_frima_02_12,Me
m_ex_frima_02_13,Are you the one who wants coffee with cream?
m_ex_frima_02_14,Yes
m_ex_frima_02_15,Where are you right now?
m_ex_frima_02_16,Cafe
m_ex_frima_02_17,On sofa
m_ex_frima_02_18,???
m_ex_frima_02_19,??
m_ex_frima_02_20,"If you're at the cafe, then can't you just brew it yourself?"
m_ex_frima_02_21,Already
m_ex_frima_02_22,Lying down
m_ex_frima_02_23,Vending machine
m_ex_frima_02_24,Too far
m_ex_frima_02_25,Ask Sugar or Milk
m_ex_frima_02_26,Sugar out
m_ex_frima_02_27,Milk out
m_ex_frima_02_28,Vending machine
m_ex_frima_02_29,Too far
m_ex_frima_02_30,How much is the delivery fee?
m_ex_frima_02_31,??????
m_ex_frima_02_32,???
m_ex_frima_02_33,... No reply from Frima
m_ex_frima_02_34,Frima?
m_ex_frima_02_35,Yes?

m_ex_frima_02_37,Brewed
m_ex_frima_02_38,Myself
m_ex_frima_02_39,Delivery fee

m_ex_frima_02_44,Bye
m_ex_frima_02_45,Bye
m_ex_frima_03_1,Dream
m_ex_frima_03_2,Need to buy
m_ex_frima_03_3,Lottery
m_ex_frima_03_4,Did you have a good dream?
m_ex_frima_03_5,Yes
m_ex_frima_03_6,The surface
m_ex_frima_03_7,Raptures
m_ex_frima_03_8,all gone
m_ex_frima_03_9,Missions
m_ex_frima_03_10,no need
m_ex_frima_03_11,Is that really what's important?
m_ex_frima_03_12,Reclaiming the surface... sounds like a nice dream.
m_ex_frima_03_13,Yes
m_ex_frima_03_14,Of course
m_ex_frima_03_15,Yes
m_ex_frima_03_16,Go
m_ex_frima_03_17,Are you telling me to go purchase a lottery ticket?
m_ex_frima_03_18,Yes
m_ex_frima_03_19,If win
m_ex_frima_03_20,10% for you.
m_ex_frima_03_21,"Don't worry, this one's on me."
m_ex_frima_03_22,You better bump that up to 25%.
m_ex_frima_03_23,You
m_ex_frima_03_24,angel?
m_ex_frima_03_25,Love
m_ex_frima_03_26,Too much
m_ex_frima_03_27,Greedy
m_ex_frima_03_28,How about 15%?
m_ex_frima_03_29,Deal
m_ex_frima_03_30,Now go
m_ex_frima_03_31,I purchased a lottery ticket online...
m_ex_frima_03_32,Numbers?
m_ex_frima_03_33,16 22 34 40
m_ex_frima_03_34,3 18 31 9 22
m_ex_frima_03_35,No
m_ex_frima_03_36,No good.
m_ex_frima_03_37,What is that?
m_ex_frima_03_38,Numbers
m_ex_frima_03_39,different
m_ex_frima_03_40,from
m_ex_frima_03_41,dream
m_ex_frima_03_42,Why didn't you tell me earlier?
m_ex_frima_03_43,Need to
m_ex_frima_03_44,write
m_ex_frima_03_45,10 numbers
m_ex_frima_03_46,Too many
m_ex_frima_03_47,...
m_ex_frima_03_48,Oh well.
m_ex_frima_03_49,Going to sleep
m_ex_frima_03_50,Goodnight.
m_ex_frima_03_51,The lottery ticket ended up being a dud.
m_ex_guillotine_01_1,"I'm asking thee,"
m_ex_guillotine_01_2,are thou my Commander?
m_ex_guillotine_01_3,??
m_ex_guillotine_01_4,I have the Dark Lord sealed in my right eye.
m_ex_guillotine_01_5,Guillotine De Mephisto
m_ex_guillotine_01_6,I'm here to answer your call.
m_ex_guillotine_01_7,"From this moment onwards, my spear will be with you."
m_ex_guillotine_01_8,Your destiy will be with me.
m_ex_guillotine_01_9,destiy->destiny
m_ex_guillotine_01_10,Typo.
m_ex_guillotine_01_11,It's fine.
m_ex_guillotine_01_12,I can't believe that you misspelled such an important word.
m_ex_guillotine_01_13,Hehehe...
m_ex_guillotine_01_14,Foolish mortal.
m_ex_guillotine_01_15,You know nothing about all of these.
m_ex_guillotine_01_16,Oh...
m_ex_guillotine_01_17,This Commander is meaner than I thought.
m_ex_guillotine_01_18,But...
m_ex_guillotine_01_19,If a typo is corrected within 3 seconds
m_ex_guillotine_01_20,the power inside the text won't disappear.
m_ex_guillotine_01_21,It seems like you have no clue about it.
m_ex_guillotine_01_22,Hehehe...
m_ex_guillotine_01_23,"Anyway,"
m_ex_guillotine_01_24,"From now on, I, Guillotine De Mephisto,"
m_ex_guillotine_01_25,and the One-Winged Dark Lord
m_ex_guillotine_01_26,"sealed in my right eye, will be with you."
m_ex_guillotine_01_27,"You will be invincible across all battlefields,"
m_ex_guillotine_01_28,and enjoy the eternal victory.
m_ex_guillotine_01_29,Hahaha!
m_ex_guillotine_01_30,Hahahahaha!
m_ex_guillotine_01_31,... It seems like I have summoned something that cannot bear with ordinary magic resistance ...
m_ex_guillotine_02_1,Have you heard?
m_ex_guillotine_02_2,Things are falling apart.
m_ex_guillotine_02_3,Yeah?
m_ex_guillotine_02_4,Apocalypse is gone.
m_ex_guillotine_02_5,The organization must have snuck
m_ex_guillotine_02_6,into my room and stolen it.
m_ex_guillotine_02_7,"If its contents are leaked,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_8,"then you, I, and the entire Outpost"
m_ex_guillotine_02_9,will be doomed.
m_ex_guillotine_02_10,We'll suffer through the end of days
m_ex_guillotine_02_11,before we can achieve our dream of reclaiming the surface.
m_ex_guillotine_02_12,What exactly is Apocalypse anyway?
m_ex_guillotine_02_13,That's a good question.
m_ex_guillotine_02_14,It's a great tome in which a prophecy is written.
m_ex_guillotine_02_15,This prophecy speaks of the end of times
m_ex_guillotine_02_16,and the coming of a divine savior.
m_ex_guillotine_02_17,"In the greatest detail,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_18,it describes the secret of my birth
m_ex_guillotine_02_19,"and how I, Guillotine de Mephisto,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_20,sealed away the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_guillotine_02_21,"Once the world is rendered asunder, Ragnarok shall arise."
m_ex_guillotine_02_22,I think I get the gist.
m_ex_guillotine_02_23,"I see, it's a book about ""World Building""."
m_ex_guillotine_02_24,It even speaks of my ultimate purpose.
m_ex_guillotine_02_25,"Alas,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_26,I should have known
m_ex_guillotine_02_27,you would be quick to understand.
m_ex_guillotine_02_28,Hehehe
m_ex_guillotine_02_29,It even speaks of my ultimate purpose.
m_ex_guillotine_02_30,???
m_ex_guillotine_02_31,I'm afraid I do not understand what you are saying.
m_ex_guillotine_02_32,"The Apocalypse and ""World Building"" are fundamentally different."
m_ex_guillotine_02_33,Comparing the two is unthinkable.
m_ex_guillotine_02_34,So what can I do to help?
m_ex_guillotine_02_35,It's simple.
m_ex_guillotine_02_36,Inform all the Nikkes in the dorm
m_ex_guillotine_02_37,that whoever stole Apocalypse
m_ex_guillotine_02_38,is to return to its rightful owner at once.
m_ex_guillotine_02_39,Didn't you say the organization stole it?
m_ex_guillotine_02_40,I understand.
m_ex_guillotine_02_41,Let me rephrase.
m_ex_guillotine_02_42,Those who stole it were the lackeys of the organization
m_ex_guillotine_02_43,and they were cleverly hidden
m_ex_guillotine_02_44,among all the Nikkes.
m_ex_guillotine_02_45,"Before that, I think you should start the broadcast."
m_ex_guillotine_02_46,We are faced with the end.
m_ex_guillotine_02_47,There is no time for small talk.
m_ex_guillotine_02_48,Good.
m_ex_guillotine_02_49,Then start the broadcast.
m_ex_guillotine_02_50,I will wait in my dorm so
m_ex_guillotine_02_51,come to my room as soon as
m_ex_guillotine_02_52,you get the Apocalypse.
m_ex_guillotine_02_53,One more thing to remember is that
m_ex_guillotine_02_54,you should never open the Apocalypse.
m_ex_guillotine_02_55,The danger level of the Apocalypse is as high as 9 out of 10.
m_ex_guillotine_02_56,Okay.
m_ex_guillotine_02_57,I turn on the microphone and broadcast a lost and found announcement across the entire dormitory.
m_ex_guillotine_02_58,?
m_ex_guillotine_02_59,Wait.
m_ex_guillotine_02_60,You... Why did you do that?
m_ex_guillotine_02_61,Why did you describe Apocalypse as my own novel?
m_ex_guillotine_02_62,"If I didn't, I don't think they would have understood."
m_ex_guillotine_02_63,Because I didn't think it was fundamentally different.
m_ex_guillotine_02_64,???
m_ex_guillotine_02_65,What foolishness.
m_ex_guillotine_02_66,What do you mean?
m_ex_guillotine_02_67,Have your eyes been blurred to see the fundamental?
m_ex_guillotine_02_68,This object is way more dangerous than a novel.
m_ex_guillotine_02_69,asdfjklasd
m_ex_guillotine_02_70,"If you describe the Apocalypse as a mere novel,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_71,"the Nikkes, who have it, will be tempted"
m_ex_guillotine_02_72,to see the forbidden contents inside.
m_ex_guillotine_02_73,What will you do about this situation?
m_ex_guillotine_02_74,I'm sorry.
m_ex_guillotine_02_75,Sigh...
m_ex_guillotine_02_76,Such a foolish mortal.
m_ex_guillotine_02_77,But the lost property has just been reported.
m_ex_guillotine_02_78,What?
m_ex_guillotine_02_79,Emma said she found it in your new bag.
m_ex_guillotine_02_80,...
m_ex_guillotine_02_81,She also said the contents were interesting and she was curious about the next part.
m_ex_guillotine_02_82,Oh no.
m_ex_guillotine_02_83,This is...
m_ex_guillotine_02_84,irreversible.
m_ex_guillotine_02_85,Then there is only one thing I can do.
m_ex_guillotine_02_86,I'll turn the timeline back and make things all right.
m_ex_guillotine_02_87,"Then, Partner."
m_ex_guillotine_02_88,"No, you, who was once my Partner,"
m_ex_guillotine_02_89,hope we can meet on the right timeline next time.
m_ex_guillotine_02_90,Then so long
m_ex_guillotine_02_91,El
m_ex_guillotine_02_92,Telama
m_ex_guillotine_02_93,Solus
m_ex_guillotine_02_94,"... After that, Guillotine locks herself in the room and doesn't come out for a while."
m_ex_guillotine_03_1,Sigh...
m_ex_guillotine_03_2,Partner.
m_ex_guillotine_03_3,What's the matter?
m_ex_guillotine_03_4,Are you close by?
m_ex_guillotine_03_5,I believe someone has put a curse on me.
m_ex_guillotine_03_6,A curse?
m_ex_guillotine_03_7,"Yes, a curse."
m_ex_guillotine_03_8,I can feel the energy being drained from my body.
m_ex_guillotine_03_9,My stomach is rattling
m_ex_guillotine_03_10,and beginning to emit strange sounds as well.
m_ex_guillotine_03_11,You don't say...
m_ex_guillotine_03_12,This foul curse is slowly sapping away my magic.
m_ex_guillotine_03_13,Are you able to help me?
m_ex_guillotine_03_14,Where are you now?
m_ex_guillotine_03_15,My presence must not be revealed.
m_ex_guillotine_03_16,"I am a being that lies hidden in the shadows, out of sight."
m_ex_guillotine_03_17,I think you are hungry so I'll give you some food.
m_ex_guillotine_03_18,I think I have something that can lift this curse.
m_ex_guillotine_03_19,What is that?
m_ex_guillotine_03_20,"Ah, I understand."
m_ex_guillotine_03_21,You are wary that whoever put this curse upon me is nearby
m_ex_guillotine_03_22,so you are speaking in code.
m_ex_guillotine_03_23,Very wise indeed!
m_ex_guillotine_03_24,Quite prudent of you.
m_ex_guillotine_03_25,"Excellent, thank you!"
m_ex_guillotine_03_26,It was wise to have asked for your help.
m_ex_guillotine_03_27,"Due to my body being cursed, I am unable to move right now."
m_ex_guillotine_03_28,"I will send my location to you. If you can send it to me, I will be eternally grateful."
m_ex_guillotine_03_29,Got it.
m_ex_guillotine_03_30,"By the way, I don't like salty food."
m_ex_guillotine_03_31,???
m_ex_guillotine_03_32,I will leave my life in your hands.
m_ex_guillotine_03_33,... I'll have to order some takeout for Guillotine.
m_ex_harran_01_1,It's not often for something so interesting to occur.
m_ex_harran_01_2,I received your message from that backwater you're all living in.
m_ex_harran_01_3,What do you wish me to do?
m_ex_harran_01_4,I hope you can assist us in battle.
m_ex_harran_01_5,I hope you can help us reclaim the surface.
m_ex_harran_01_6,Is that so?
m_ex_harran_01_7,"I can see why you would want that,"
m_ex_harran_01_8,but it's of no interest to me.
m_ex_harran_01_9,I'll give you one more chance.
m_ex_harran_01_10,Try and put a smile on my face this time around.
m_ex_harran_01_11,And how do I do that?
m_ex_harran_01_12,You're asking me?
m_ex_harran_01_13,"A foolish question, if there ever was one."
m_ex_harran_01_14,"Nevertheless, you have piqued my interest, so I will forgive you."
m_ex_harran_01_15,"If you wish to please me, it is quite simple."
m_ex_harran_01_16,"You, as the prey, must do your utmost to"
m_ex_harran_01_17,"compliment me, the predator."
m_ex_harran_01_18,"Speak your honeyed words and praise me to the heavens,"
m_ex_harran_01_19,but do not ask me what specific words you must utter.
m_ex_harran_01_20,That responsibility rests on your shoulders.
m_ex_harran_01_21,"So basically, I need to be a skilled orator who can paint a picture with words."
m_ex_harran_01_22,"So basically, I need to get on your good side."
m_ex_harran_01_23,Putting a little bit of veneration in there
m_ex_harran_01_24,"certainly wouldn't hurt, either."
m_ex_harran_01_25,"Now, I will ask you for the last time."
m_ex_harran_01_26,What do you wish me to do?
m_ex_harran_01_27,"Oh noble predator of the surface, would you kindly lend me your protection?"
m_ex_harran_01_28,Finally.
m_ex_harran_01_29,A decent speech.
m_ex_harran_01_30,And what do you offer me in return?
m_ex_harran_01_31,My reverence.
m_ex_harran_01_32,My service.
m_ex_harran_01_33,"Still a bit rough around the edges,"
m_ex_harran_01_34,"but you know your place in the presence of the strong, and that pleases me."
m_ex_harran_01_35,Very well.
m_ex_harran_01_36,Your wish will be fulfilled.
m_ex_harran_01_37,You may summon me whenever
m_ex_harran_01_38,you need me or are in jeopardy.
m_ex_harran_01_39,"Regardless of the distance, I will find you."
m_ex_harran_01_40,"But keep in mind, you should be grateful and"
m_ex_harran_01_41,never forget the promise you have made to me.
m_ex_harran_01_42,"Otherwise, the one who was once your protector will become your greatest enemy."
m_ex_harran_01_43,I'll keep that in mind.
m_ex_harran_02_1,"If you're not occupied with anything at the moment,"
m_ex_harran_02_2,can you help me with something important?
m_ex_harran_02_3,How important?
m_ex_harran_02_4,Very Important.
m_ex_harran_02_5,Are you good at coming up with names?
m_ex_harran_02_6,Nobody does it better than me.
m_ex_harran_02_7,"If I weren't a Commander, I'd do it for a living."
m_ex_harran_02_8,I admire your confidence.
m_ex_harran_02_9,"I'm not entirely convinced,"
m_ex_harran_02_10,but can you come up with something
m_ex_harran_02_11,for my raven?
m_ex_harran_02_12,You want to name your raven?
m_ex_harran_02_13,Yes.
m_ex_harran_02_14,I think it's a good idea.
m_ex_harran_02_15,Do you have something in mind?
m_ex_harran_02_16,Pitch-black
m_ex_harran_02_17,Cawy
m_ex_harran_02_18,You can't be serious.
m_ex_harran_02_19,"Even if you are, do you actually think"
m_ex_harran_02_20,such a ridiculous name is befitting for my raven?
m_ex_harran_02_21,"I wasn't going to take your suggestions that seriously in the first place,"
m_ex_harran_02_22,but I didn't expect them to be this lame.
m_ex_harran_02_23,I think it's a cool name.
m_ex_harran_02_24,It's so hilarious to see you say it with such confidence as well!
m_ex_harran_02_25,I'm officially speechless.
m_ex_harran_02_26,I'll give you more time to think about it carefully.
m_ex_harran_02_27,Report back to me if you come up with anything.
m_ex_harran_02_28,All right.
m_ex_harran_02_29,And please try to take it more seriously.
m_ex_harran_03_1,"Although I don't exactly trust your tastes,"
m_ex_harran_03_2,but there's no one else I can approach with this.
m_ex_harran_03_3,Which color do you think suits me best?
m_ex_harran_03_4,Are you going to dye your hair?
m_ex_harran_03_5,"No, guess again."
m_ex_harran_03_6,"My hair is perfectly fine as it is,"
m_ex_harran_03_7,and I have no intention of changing it.
m_ex_harran_03_8,Then why did you ask...?
m_ex_harran_03_9,I want to get a manicure.
m_ex_harran_03_10,"Now, can you please just tell me the color?"
m_ex_harran_03_11,Pink.
m_ex_harran_03_12,Azure blue.
m_ex_harran_03_13,Pink...
m_ex_harran_03_14,It's rather old hat...
m_ex_harran_03_15,Do you really think pink suits me?
m_ex_harran_03_16,It'll match the color of your clothes.
m_ex_harran_03_17,"Pfft, that's something all girls have heard a million times."
m_ex_harran_03_18,Azure blue...
m_ex_harran_03_19,That's an unexpected color.
m_ex_harran_03_20,What makes you think azure blue will look good on me?
m_ex_harran_03_21,I think you can really make a statement with it.
m_ex_harran_03_22,You sure it won't stand out too much?
m_ex_harran_03_23,Hmm...
m_ex_harran_03_24,"Very well, I'll consider it."
m_ex_harran_03_25,"Either way, I'll let you know when it's done."
m_ex_harran_03_26,Looking forward to the end results.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_1,"My Lord,"
m_ex_hongryeon_01_2,are thou good at drinking?
m_ex_hongryeon_01_3,I'm fond of drinking.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_4,I'm not a fan of drinking.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_5,Oh my...
m_ex_hongryeon_01_6,That's the most beautiful thing that I've ever heard.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_7,Is that so?
m_ex_hongryeon_01_8,What a pity.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_9,How so?
m_ex_hongryeon_01_10,"When wandering on the surface,
splendid drinks come to me."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_11,"But, the most pitiful thing is having no one to share them with."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_12,"An idea suddenly hit me,"
m_ex_hongryeon_01_13,"if thou know the joy of drinking, 
we can share together."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_14,"If that's the case, I can have a drink with you anytime."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_15,Wow!
m_ex_hongryeon_01_16,Understood.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_17,I shall join you in mine spare time.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_18,"But, my Lord."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_19,Dost thou have any alcohol stored at the house?
m_ex_hongryeon_01_20,I have.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_21,"Wow, wow."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_22,"I hath each moment been curious about what they taste like, those drinks from the Ark."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_23,It seems like I be about to have one.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_24,When are you coming over?
m_ex_hongryeon_01_25,I know not.
m_ex_hongryeon_01_26,"So, expect not too much."
m_ex_hongryeon_01_27,I shall call thee later.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_1,My Lord.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_2,"Let me guess, alcohol?"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_3,Most correct.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_4,"In fact, I intended to bring some spirits over"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_5,when my eyes chanced upon a book on the ground.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_6,"And heavens above, 'twere about alcohol!"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_7,Within that book's pages there was contained
m_ex_hongryeon_02_8,"script pertaining to what was called an ""Alcohol Bomb."""
m_ex_hongryeon_02_9,Alcohol bomb?
m_ex_hongryeon_02_10,The script declares that
m_ex_hongryeon_02_11,"through the intermarriage of various intoxicants,"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_12,one can produce a most fanciful potation.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_13,What say thou?
m_ex_hongryeon_02_14,Shall we caution an attempt upon it?
m_ex_hongryeon_02_15,Let's mix alcohol from the surface and from the Ark.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_16,Will it even taste any good?
m_ex_hongryeon_02_17,Oh...
m_ex_hongryeon_02_18,"My Lord,"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_19,never allow such jaundiced words to spill from thy tongue before imbibing it thyself!
m_ex_hongryeon_02_20,"All right, let's give it a try."
m_ex_hongryeon_02_21,"Jolly good, that's the spirit!"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_22,We shall invent a new elixir.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_23,"Oh, how mine spirit quivers with excitement"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_24,I shall procure a most alluring spirit and join to thy lodgings soon.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_25,"As for thou, my Lord,"
m_ex_hongryeon_02_26,thou must do the same here in the Ark.
m_ex_hongryeon_02_27,Okay
m_ex_hongryeon_03_1,My Lord.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_2,"In thy mind, which spirit emits the most alluring siren's bid?"
m_ex_hongryeon_03_3,"The sweet taste of your lips, fresh with a drink."
m_ex_hongryeon_03_4,Free booze?
m_ex_hongryeon_03_5,I see thy ebullience hath improved since our last meeting.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_6,"Now that, I cannot refute!"
m_ex_hongryeon_03_7,"I am ranking every last spirit I hast imbibed in all mine days,"
m_ex_hongryeon_03_8,and am in a tangle as whereto shall be the victor.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_9,"In thy opinion,"
m_ex_hongryeon_03_10,which dost thou find dance most aptly upon the taste buds?
m_ex_hongryeon_03_11,"Any alcohol, so long as it's with a good company as you."
m_ex_hongryeon_03_12,"Free booze is the best booze, bar none."
m_ex_hongryeon_03_13,Haha! It seems thou hast already partaken in some indulgences
m_ex_hongryeon_03_14,in mine absence today.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_15,"Nevertheless, I am pleased to hark such honeyed words."
m_ex_hongryeon_03_16,Quite correct.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_17,I feel that alcohol tastes sweeter when it's free.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_18,Haha
m_ex_hongryeon_03_19,Talking about alcohol with thou
m_ex_hongryeon_03_20,hath made me crave for a drink.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_21,Perhaps I truly like to hast a drink together with you.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_22,It hath been many a moon since we last drank.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_23,I shall bring over some spirits if thou are not opposed.
m_ex_hongryeon_03_24,I will be waiting.
m_ex_isabel_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_isabel_01_2,"Do you remember me,"
m_ex_isabel_01_3,Darling?
m_ex_isabel_01_4,Of course.
m_ex_isabel_01_5,Remind me again?
m_ex_isabel_01_6,Oh my!
m_ex_isabel_01_7,That's music to my ears.
m_ex_isabel_01_8,Glad to hear I at least made something of an impression.
m_ex_isabel_01_9,"Yet, I'm currently in somewhat of a lousy mood."
m_ex_isabel_01_10,"I was going to call you earlier,"
m_ex_isabel_01_11,but I'm shy around strangers.
m_ex_isabel_01_12,"So, I need a little pick-me-up."
m_ex_isabel_01_13,You're still as mischievous as before
m_ex_isabel_01_14,and always know how to push my buttons.
m_ex_isabel_01_15,"Even so, I know you're just teasing me."
m_ex_isabel_01_16,"I'm sure you were waiting for my call, weren't you?"
m_ex_isabel_01_17,??
m_ex_isabel_01_18,"Come now, don't try to hide it."
m_ex_isabel_01_19,I can read you like an open book.
m_ex_isabel_01_20,"It's nice to role-play every once a while, don't you think?"
m_ex_isabel_01_21,Pretend to be strangers who are meeting for the first time...
m_ex_isabel_01_22,Wouldn't you say that it's exhilarating?
m_ex_isabel_01_23,"Anyhoo, if you want to know anything about me,"
m_ex_isabel_01_24,ask away.
m_ex_isabel_01_25,Why do you call me Darling?
m_ex_isabel_01_26,"You're working for another Commander, so why are you responding to me?"
m_ex_isabel_01_27,Cus...
m_ex_isabel_01_28,do you really wanna know?
m_ex_isabel_01_29,Yes.
m_ex_isabel_01_30,"Well, I'm hoping that one day you'll..."
m_ex_isabel_01_31,There's a long silence.
m_ex_isabel_01_32,I can't do it.
m_ex_isabel_01_33,I'd rather not discuss it over text.
m_ex_isabel_01_34,Sorry.
m_ex_isabel_01_35,It's okay.
m_ex_isabel_01_36,"It's because you've given me something,"
m_ex_isabel_01_37,even my own Commander doesn't give me.
m_ex_isabel_01_38,"Once I've accomplished a task,"
m_ex_isabel_01_39,he doesn't want anything to do with me.
m_ex_isabel_01_40,Does that explain things?
m_ex_isabel_01_41,Sure.
m_ex_isabel_01_42,"All right, my turn."
m_ex_isabel_01_43,What kind of girls do you like?
m_ex_isabel_01_44,"No, wait..."
m_ex_isabel_01_45,What kind of Nikkes do you like?
m_ex_isabel_01_46,Strong and amiable.
m_ex_isabel_01_47,Nikkes like you.
m_ex_isabel_01_48,"Strong and amiable,"
m_ex_isabel_01_49,just like you.
m_ex_isabel_01_50,No surprise there.
m_ex_isabel_01_51,People say that lovers start to bleed into one another over time.
m_ex_isabel_01_52,I'm sure I'll be like you in the future.
m_ex_isabel_01_53,Where'd that come from?
m_ex_isabel_01_54,To think you've said smth like this out of nowhere
m_ex_isabel_01_55,"Sorry,"
m_ex_isabel_01_56,but I just don't know what to say.
m_ex_isabel_01_57,I'm glad you feel that way though.
m_ex_isabel_01_58,... Isabel seems to be unsure of what to reply.
m_ex_isabel_01_59,I'm glad I got to
m_ex_isabel_01_60,talk with you today.
m_ex_isabel_01_61,Would you mind if we keep in touch?
m_ex_isabel_01_62,I can send you a message whenever I'm feeling lonely.
m_ex_isabel_01_63,Sure.
m_ex_isabel_01_64,Thanks.
m_ex_isabel_01_65,I'll see you later.
m_ex_isabel_01_66,I've got an assignment
m_ex_isabel_01_67,up on the surface.
m_ex_isabel_01_68,"Wait, so you've been in the Ark this entire time?"
m_ex_isabel_01_69,Yep!
m_ex_isabel_01_70,I just wanted to see your reaction
m_ex_isabel_01_71,when you were chatting with me.
m_ex_isabel_01_72,??
m_ex_isabel_01_73,I'll always be with you
m_ex_isabel_01_74,"wherever you are,"
m_ex_isabel_01_75,my Darling.
m_ex_isabel_01_76,"All right, it's time for me to go."
m_ex_isabel_01_77,I need to hurry. Don't wanna to test Noah's patience.
m_ex_isabel_01_78,Wait!
m_ex_isabel_01_79,Failed to send message.
m_ex_isabel_02_1,"Darling,"
m_ex_isabel_02_2,you look rather down today.
m_ex_isabel_02_3,What's going on?
m_ex_isabel_02_4,???
m_ex_isabel_02_5,Is someone giving you a hard time?
m_ex_isabel_02_6,"Tell me who it is, and I'll set them straight."
m_ex_isabel_02_7,I'm actually in a pretty good mood today.
m_ex_isabel_02_8,You sure?
m_ex_isabel_02_9,You don't look as good as you did yesterday.
m_ex_isabel_02_10,I can see it all over your face.
m_ex_isabel_02_11,Your eyebrows are furrowed and everything.
m_ex_isabel_02_12,What are you keeping from me?
m_ex_isabel_02_13,You can tell all that just by looking at my face?
m_ex_isabel_02_14,"Of course, I can."
m_ex_isabel_02_15,"I care about you more than anything,"
m_ex_isabel_02_16,so please tell me the truth.
m_ex_isabel_02_17,Why do you look so sad?
m_ex_isabel_02_18,I guess I do feel kinda hungry...
m_ex_isabel_02_19,Oh!
m_ex_isabel_02_20,So that's it!
m_ex_isabel_02_21,"Well, as fortune would have it,"
m_ex_isabel_02_22,I happened to bring you something.
m_ex_isabel_02_23,Turn around.
m_ex_isabel_02_24,??
m_ex_isabel_02_25,There is a box behind the chair
m_ex_isabel_02_26,"Ta-dah! Apples! Picked them myself too,"
m_ex_isabel_02_27,and they're all yours.
m_ex_isabel_02_28,What the... When did you put these here?
m_ex_isabel_02_29,"Well, duty calls."
m_ex_isabel_02_30,See ya!
m_ex_isabel_03_1,Commander's Room
m_ex_isabel_03_2,doesn't have a password?
m_ex_isabel_03_3,Why would I need that?
m_ex_isabel_03_4,"For one,"
m_ex_isabel_03_5,it's practically a revolving door for all the Nikkes coming in and out.
m_ex_isabel_03_6,Don't you think that's a security risk?
m_ex_isabel_03_7,"They're here for work reasons, that's all."
m_ex_isabel_03_8,I wouldn't be so sure of that
m_ex_isabel_03_9,if I were you.
m_ex_isabel_03_10,"Last time, I saw a Nikke enter"
m_ex_isabel_03_11,and went straight for the bathroom.
m_ex_isabel_03_12,How do you explain that?
m_ex_isabel_03_13,The water in the dorm bathrooms often runs out.
m_ex_isabel_03_14,"That's fair enough,"
m_ex_isabel_03_15,but I don't understand why they are taking a shower in your private bathroom?
m_ex_isabel_03_16,I offered to let them use it.
m_ex_isabel_03_17,Wow!
m_ex_isabel_03_18,You're so considerate!
m_ex_isabel_03_19,"You know, a little bit of selfishness"
m_ex_isabel_03_20,isn't necessarily a bad thing.
m_ex_isabel_03_21,Is it only because of the water shortage?
m_ex_isabel_03_22,"Yes, it is."
m_ex_isabel_03_23,Gotcha.
m_ex_isabel_03_24,I thought they might have been harboring some ill intentions.
m_ex_isabel_03_25,"If so, I was gonna give 'em a working over!"
m_ex_isabel_03_26,"But since you gave them the green light, I'll spare them this time."
m_ex_isabel_03_27,Thanks for understanding.
m_ex_isabel_03_28,No problem!
m_ex_isabel_03_29,I think I should get running water back to the dorm bathrooms.
m_ex_isabel_03_30,Are you sure?
m_ex_isabel_03_31,Positive.
m_ex_isabel_03_32,"You may be okay with it,"
m_ex_isabel_03_33,but I can't stand
m_ex_isabel_03_34,the idea of other Nikkes showering in your quarters.
m_ex_isabel_03_35,Have a good rest.
m_ex_julia_01_1,Here comes the sound of fate which makes people emotional.
m_ex_julia_01_2,It's like raindrops hitting the surface of the lake.
m_ex_julia_01_3,What an exciting rhythm!
m_ex_julia_01_4,"It's very good to see you, Conductor."
m_ex_julia_01_5,"My name is Julia, and we'll be performing together in the future."
m_ex_julia_01_6,Conductor?
m_ex_julia_01_7,?
m_ex_julia_01_8,"What's the matter, Conductor?"
m_ex_julia_01_9,I'm not a Conductor.
m_ex_julia_01_10,!!
m_ex_julia_01_11,Is that so?
m_ex_julia_01_12,I'm sorry.
m_ex_julia_01_13,Looks like the messages were sent to the wrong person
m_ex_julia_01_14,because I can't play with the flow of time yet.
m_ex_julia_01_15,Please excuse my rudeness.
m_ex_julia_01_16,May everything you do will be filled with joyful melodies.
m_ex_julia_01_17,Julia?
m_ex_julia_01_18,There is no response.
m_ex_julia_01_19,After a while.
m_ex_julia_01_20,Here comes the sound of fate which makes people...
m_ex_julia_01_21,??
m_ex_julia_01_22,Aren't you the one who replied to me a moment ago?
m_ex_julia_01_23,I was rude again.
m_ex_julia_01_24,"No, I'm your Commander."
m_ex_julia_01_25,Really? So you are the Conductor!
m_ex_julia_01_26,That's a relief.
m_ex_julia_01_27,But why do you call me a Conductor?
m_ex_julia_01_28,"That's because you face an enormous audience,"
m_ex_julia_01_29,leading countless performers
m_ex_julia_01_30,and creating the melody being played on the battlefield.
m_ex_julia_01_31,It sounds like an exaggeration of what I do.
m_ex_julia_01_32,"No, it's not an exaggeration. Besides,
I don't think it's enough to express your excellence."
m_ex_julia_01_33,Thank you.
m_ex_julia_01_34,"I should be thanking you, Conductor."
m_ex_julia_01_35,I'm so delighted to be performing on the world's stage in the future with you.
m_ex_julia_01_36,Let's give a remarkable performance together.
m_ex_julia_01_37,Likewise.
m_ex_julia_02_1,"Conductor,"
m_ex_julia_02_2,good... morning?
m_ex_julia_02_3,Why the question mark?
m_ex_julia_02_4,Morning?
m_ex_julia_02_5,"I'm sorry,"
m_ex_julia_02_6,I wasn't sure if it was morning.
m_ex_julia_02_7,"Oh no,"
m_ex_julia_02_8,is it not morning?
m_ex_julia_02_9,"I'm sorry,"
m_ex_julia_02_10,I went straight to practice for a while after returning from a trip.
m_ex_julia_02_11,"Before I knew it, I'd let myself get carried away by the music"
m_ex_julia_02_12,and lost track of time!
m_ex_julia_02_13,So you've been practicing instead of sleeping?
m_ex_julia_02_14,That's right.
m_ex_julia_02_15,It's only because
m_ex_julia_02_16,I couldn't bring myself to
m_ex_julia_02_17,disrupt the musical flow.
m_ex_julia_02_18,Hurry up and get some sleep.
m_ex_julia_02_19,I can't do that!
m_ex_julia_02_20,It's been a long while since
m_ex_julia_02_21,I've been somewhere so comfy.
m_ex_julia_02_22,"It's enough to inspire one to write a symphony,"
m_ex_julia_02_23,so I can't let such inspiration pass me by.
m_ex_julia_02_24,"Come, tell me"
m_ex_julia_02_25,what would you like to hear?
m_ex_julia_02_26,"If I start my day on a happy note,"
m_ex_julia_02_27,I'm positive I can make it last for a long time.
m_ex_julia_02_28,I'll tell you once you wake up.
m_ex_julia_02_29,!
m_ex_julia_02_30,But the moment may have passed by then...
m_ex_julia_02_31,Then I'll let you know while you're dreaming.
m_ex_julia_02_32,But how?
m_ex_julia_02_33,??
m_ex_julia_02_34,Just because you want to share the same dream with someone
m_ex_julia_02_35,doesn't mean you can dream it into existence.
m_ex_julia_02_36,Unless... someone developed a device like that
m_ex_julia_02_37,while I was up on the surface?
m_ex_julia_02_38,I'm afraid not.
m_ex_julia_02_39,"Oh, just as I thought."
m_ex_julia_02_40,"Either way, I'm heading to bed, and I suggest you do the same."
m_ex_julia_02_41,!!
m_ex_julia_02_42,Is that okay?
m_ex_julia_02_43,Absolutely not!
m_ex_julia_02_44,Actually...
m_ex_julia_02_45,I never considered playing music while dreaming.
m_ex_julia_02_46,Hmm...
m_ex_julia_02_47,My teachers always told me true artists
m_ex_julia_02_48,should never be deceived by emotional appeals.
m_ex_julia_02_49,"However, since it's you..."
m_ex_julia_02_50,perhaps this truly can forge a new form of musical expression.
m_ex_julia_02_51,"Very well then, I will see you in my dreams."
m_ex_julia_02_52,Sweet dreams.
m_ex_julia_03_1,Conductor!
m_ex_julia_03_2,Can you spare a moment to chat?
m_ex_julia_03_3,"Sure, what is it?"
m_ex_julia_03_4,"I've been trying to venture on a new musical path,"
m_ex_julia_03_5,but I'm having trouble choosing the direction.
m_ex_julia_03_6,I was hoping you could perhaps give me some guidance?
m_ex_julia_03_7,Play music that makes you feel warm inside.
m_ex_julia_03_8,Play music that makes you tear up.
m_ex_julia_03_9,"In that case,"
m_ex_julia_03_10,I should go for music that's passionate and rhythmic.
m_ex_julia_03_11,"I've always been wary of veering in that direction,"
m_ex_julia_03_12,but if that's where you say I should go...
m_ex_julia_03_13,"In that case,"
m_ex_julia_03_14,I should go for the kind of music that takes you back to simpler times.
m_ex_julia_03_15,"I've actually dabbled in that style before,"
m_ex_julia_03_16,but it seems you're saying I should focus all my attention on it...
m_ex_julia_03_17,"All right, then it's settled! Starting today, that's what I'll do!"
m_ex_julia_03_18,So quickly?
m_ex_julia_03_19,There's no point in wasting time since I've decided which direction to pursue.
m_ex_julia_03_20,Thank you for your help.
m_ex_julia_03_21,"Once I accomplish what I've set out to do, I'll give you the performance of a lifetime, Conductor."
m_ex_julia_03_22,I look forward to it.
m_ex_liter_01_1,Greeeeenhorn.
m_ex_liter_01_2,Greenhorn.
m_ex_liter_01_3,??
m_ex_liter_01_4,Stioupd messaging.

m_ex_ludmilla_01_1,Servant!
m_ex_ludmilla_01_2,I heard that you're finally going to be with me.
m_ex_ludmilla_01_3,Congratulations!
m_ex_ludmilla_01_4,"I appreciate your efforts, and I hope you'll continue to cherish me more in the future."
m_ex_ludmilla_01_5,Oh my... not again?!
m_ex_ludmilla_01_6,???
m_ex_ludmilla_01_7,Damn it!
m_ex_ludmilla_01_8,Even this one is dying on me as well.
m_ex_ludmilla_01_9,Ludmilla?
m_ex_ludmilla_01_10,"No matter how long the wait, there's still no response."
m_ex_ludmilla_01_11,It seems like Ludmilla has yet again broken the device.
m_ex_ludmilla_01_12,I guess she must have given up on replying.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_1,"Servant, rejoice!"
m_ex_ludmilla_02_2,"At long last, a pair of gloves have appeared,"
m_ex_ludmilla_02_3,allowing machines to withstand my touch!
m_ex_ludmilla_02_4,Congratulations
m_ex_ludmilla_02_5,Congratulations?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_6,It sounds like this is news to you.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_7,Is it not?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_8,"If you were planning on a surprise, you can give up now."
m_ex_ludmilla_02_9,The cat is already out of the bag.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_10,I really didn't send it.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_11,What?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_12,You really didn't send these gloves?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_13,"Well, this is rather unexpected."
m_ex_ludmilla_02_14,I was certain it was you.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_15,Are you saying you don't know who sent you the gloves?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_16,That's right.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_17,I received a package in the mail a few days ago.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_18,Inside were these mysterious gloves
m_ex_ludmilla_02_19,"and a note saying,"
m_ex_ludmilla_02_20,"""For the sake of countless cuties in this world."""
m_ex_ludmilla_02_21,"I'm not sure what cuties they're referring to,"
m_ex_ludmilla_02_22,"but at the very least, it seems that"
m_ex_ludmilla_02_23,they're familiar with what my body is capable of.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_24,So I thought it was you who sent it.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_25,For the sake of countless cuties...
m_ex_ludmilla_02_26,"Yes, that's what is written on the note."
m_ex_ludmilla_02_27,So...
m_ex_ludmilla_02_28,you've taken to calling Nikkes cuties now?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_29,A lot has changed since I was here last.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_30,You've got the wrong idea!
m_ex_ludmilla_02_31,Have I?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_32,fhslhslfkj
m_ex_ludmilla_02_33,fsljflsafj
m_ex_ludmilla_02_34,Did it break again?
m_ex_ludmilla_02_35,There is no further response.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_36,Looks like Ludmilla has broken yet another device.
m_ex_ludmilla_02_37,"I'll have to explain the whole ""cutie"" misunderstanding with her later."
m_ex_ludmilla_03_1,Rabbity!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_2,"Wait, that's not it..."
m_ex_ludmilla_03_3,??
m_ex_ludmilla_03_4,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_ludmilla_03_5,Servant :D
m_ex_ludmilla_03_6,???
m_ex_ludmilla_03_7,I have something to ask you ^___^
m_ex_ludmilla_03_8,Ludmilla?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_9,What's the newest trend
m_ex_ludmilla_03_10,in the Ark these days? ^___^
m_ex_ludmilla_03_11,Tell me please!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_12,Is this Alice by any chance?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_13,!!!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_14,How do you know that?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_15,The Queen said you wouldn't know if I talked like this.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_16,I have my ways.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_17,Rabbity always knows.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_18,I should have known not to underestimate you.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_19,What did Ludmilla want you to ask?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_20,Well...
m_ex_ludmilla_03_21,Just a moment.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_22,I'll have her tell me again.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_23,I want to make sure I get all the words right :3
m_ex_ludmilla_03_24,Servant! :D
m_ex_ludmilla_03_25,Listen carefully xD
m_ex_ludmilla_03_26,There is a tea leaf :)
m_ex_ludmilla_03_27,that's all the rage right now xD
m_ex_ludmilla_03_28,Find it :)
m_ex_ludmilla_03_29,and bring it to me! :3
m_ex_ludmilla_03_30,Then I can see Rabbity!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_31,Yippee!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_32,Can I refuse?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_33,Refuse?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_34,But...
m_ex_ludmilla_03_35,then I won't be able to see you :'(
m_ex_ludmilla_03_36,That's not...
m_ex_ludmilla_03_37,The Queen'll be none too pleased either.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_38,That's not what I mea...
m_ex_ludmilla_03_39,The Queen said you don't have to explain yourself.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_40,"If you don't want to go, then so be it."
m_ex_ludmilla_03_41,"No, I'll go."
m_ex_ludmilla_03_42,Really?
m_ex_ludmilla_03_43,"Phew, that's a relief!"
m_ex_ludmilla_03_44,Can't wait to see you!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_45,Neither can the Queen!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_46,See you soon.
m_ex_ludmilla_03_47,Okay!
m_ex_ludmilla_03_48,I'll be waiting!
m_ex_maiden_01_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_maiden_01_2,Commander.
m_ex_maiden_01_3,My name is Maiden.
m_ex_maiden_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_maiden_01_5,I hope we can get along.
m_ex_maiden_01_6,Hmm...
m_ex_maiden_01_7,What are you doing?
m_ex_maiden_01_8,Assembling some action figures.
m_ex_maiden_01_9,Playing video games.
m_ex_maiden_01_10,!!
m_ex_maiden_01_11,Assembling
m_ex_maiden_01_12,action figures?
m_ex_maiden_01_13,!!
m_ex_maiden_01_14,Video game?
m_ex_maiden_01_15,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_01_16,we happen to
m_ex_maiden_01_17,have the same hobby!
m_ex_maiden_01_18,Then let's play together some time.
m_ex_maiden_01_19,What?
m_ex_maiden_01_20,together?
m_ex_maiden_01_21,Do you not want to?
m_ex_maiden_01_22,Not at all.
m_ex_maiden_01_23,I'm just so happy!
m_ex_maiden_01_24,I'm ecstatic!
m_ex_maiden_01_25,Commander...
m_ex_maiden_01_26,???
m_ex_maiden_01_27,Um...
m_ex_maiden_01_28,nothing.
m_ex_maiden_01_29,Never mind.
m_ex_maiden_01_30,Ugh!
m_ex_maiden_01_31,I'd love to
m_ex_maiden_01_32,"talk a little longer,"
m_ex_maiden_01_33,but I have to leave for a mission.
m_ex_maiden_01_34,Take care.
m_ex_maiden_01_35,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_01_36,you mustn't be so kind to me.
m_ex_maiden_01_37,I may end up falling for you.
m_ex_maiden_01_38,"No, wait... I mean..."
m_ex_maiden_01_39,We can play together
m_ex_maiden_01_40,next time.
m_ex_maiden_01_41,Okay?
m_ex_maiden_01_42,Deal.
m_ex_maiden_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_02_2,have you ever heard of lethargy?
m_ex_maiden_02_3,I've heard of it.
m_ex_maiden_02_4,Right.
m_ex_maiden_02_5,I think I've contracted that disease.
m_ex_maiden_02_6,I don't feel like doing anything today.
m_ex_maiden_02_7,Nothing can get me off the couch.
m_ex_maiden_02_8,I'm not even sure why I'm selected for this mission anyway.
m_ex_maiden_02_9,Sigh...
m_ex_maiden_02_10,How about playing games?
m_ex_maiden_02_11,"I just completed some daily quests,"
m_ex_maiden_02_12,and it feels more like a chore
m_ex_maiden_02_13,than anything.
m_ex_maiden_02_14,Even breathing seems cumbersome.
m_ex_maiden_02_15,Am I going through puberty all of sudden?
m_ex_maiden_02_16,Have you had a lot of work to do recently?
m_ex_maiden_02_17,Work?
m_ex_maiden_02_18,More than ever!
m_ex_maiden_02_19,I can't even remember what I have done!
m_ex_maiden_02_20,This is a classic sign of a burnout.
m_ex_maiden_02_21,"Wow, I never thought"
m_ex_maiden_02_22,I'd get burnt out from overexerting myself.
m_ex_maiden_02_23,You should take a break from work.
m_ex_maiden_02_24,"I'd like to, but I'm not sure if my boss will agree."
m_ex_maiden_02_25,I'll talk to her.
m_ex_maiden_02_26,!!
m_ex_maiden_02_27,Really?
m_ex_maiden_02_28,My heart... it's beating so fast!
m_ex_maiden_02_29,I don't know if it's the excitement of being able to take a break
m_ex_maiden_02_30,or because of you.
m_ex_maiden_02_31,"Either way, I feel much more energetic now."
m_ex_maiden_02_32,Thanks.
m_ex_maiden_02_33,Just take it easy.
m_ex_maiden_02_34,Yes!
m_ex_maiden_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_03_2,Why do so many nasty people
m_ex_maiden_03_3,hide behind their online screen names
m_ex_maiden_03_4,and hurl insults with such impunity?
m_ex_maiden_03_5,Did something happen?
m_ex_maiden_03_6,My character is a tank in this game I'm playing.
m_ex_maiden_03_7,But nearly every player I meet
m_ex_maiden_03_8,just says that I stink at it
m_ex_maiden_03_9,and should quit playing.
m_ex_maiden_03_10,They even drag my parents into it!
m_ex_maiden_03_11,That's too much.
m_ex_maiden_03_12,"I know, right?"
m_ex_maiden_03_13,"One time, another player got carried away."
m_ex_maiden_03_14,He somehow separated from the rest of us and died.
m_ex_maiden_03_15,"Yet, he blamed me for not doing my job!"
m_ex_maiden_03_16,He cursed me out and eventually rage quit.
m_ex_maiden_03_17,Why don't you switch classes?
m_ex_maiden_03_18,Ever thought about switching to a healer?
m_ex_maiden_03_19,Do I have to?
m_ex_maiden_03_20,I mean it's not my responsibility to keep players alive when they get carried away.
m_ex_maiden_03_21,Being a healer is stressful too.
m_ex_maiden_03_22,People are always on your case if the HPS is too low.
m_ex_maiden_03_23,"There are definitely some good players in the game,"
m_ex_maiden_03_24,but it's all gotten so toxic that fewer people want to be a tank or healer.
m_ex_maiden_03_25,Especially when all you experience is getting blamed for everything.
m_ex_maiden_03_26,"Oh, it's time for the next raid!"
m_ex_maiden_03_27,Thanks for letting me blow off some steam.
m_ex_maiden_03_28,"No worries, hope the raid goes well."
m_ex_marian_P_01_1,Comnander
m_ex_marian_P_01_2,Commsnder
m_ex_marian_P_01_3,Cimmander
m_ex_marian_P_01_4,Commander :(
m_ex_marian_P_01_5,???
m_ex_marian_P_01_6,Commander!
m_ex_marian_P_01_7,What are you doing?
m_ex_marian_P_01_8,Let's practice typing!
m_ex_marian_P_01_9,Anos said...
m_ex_marian_P_01_10,"No, I mean Anis."
m_ex_marian_P_01_11,Anis said that
m_ex_marian_P_01_12,I must do my best to call you by your name properly.
m_ex_marian_P_01_13,"Otherwise, I'll upset you."
m_ex_marian_P_01_14,"That's why, Commsnder..."
m_ex_marian_P_01_15,"No, it's Commander!"
m_ex_marian_P_01_16,I've been practicing typing the word Commander.
m_ex_marian_P_01_17,Any progress?
m_ex_marian_P_01_18,Yes!
m_ex_marian_P_01_19,Comnander.
m_ex_marian_P_01_20,"No, no!"
m_ex_marian_P_01_21,Commander!
m_ex_marian_P_01_22,Hahahahahaha
m_ex_marian_P_01_23,Hahahaha
m_ex_marian_P_01_24,LOL!
m_ex_marian_P_01_25,So you think it's funny too?
m_ex_marian_P_01_26,That's great!
m_ex_marian_P_01_27,LOL?
m_ex_marian_P_01_28,What's that supposed to mean?
m_ex_marian_P_01_29,It also means I'm laughing.
m_ex_marian_P_01_30,"Ah, I see!"
m_ex_marian_P_01_31,"I still prefer hahaha, though."
m_ex_marian_P_01_32,Doesn't all this practicing wear you out?
m_ex_marian_P_01_33,"Sure, but I find it fascinating."
m_ex_marian_P_01_34,"What's more, it lets me talk with you"
m_ex_marian_P_01_35,even when I'm not there in person.
m_ex_marian_P_01_36,That makes me happy.
m_ex_marian_P_01_37,"What about you, Commander?"
m_ex_marian_P_01_38,It makes me happy as well.
m_ex_marian_P_01_39,Hahaha.
m_ex_marian_P_01_40,"I'm glad to hear that, Cimmander."
m_ex_marian_P_01_41,Oh no...
m_ex_marian_P_01_42,Another typo.
m_ex_marian_P_01_43,Practice makes perfect.
m_ex_marian_P_01_44,Really?
m_ex_marian_P_01_45,Of course.
m_ex_marian_P_01_46,Then I'm gonna practice more
m_ex_marian_P_01_47,and show you what I can do!
m_ex_marian_P_01_48,You can do it!
m_ex_marian_P_01_49,"Yes, I will!"
m_ex_marian_P_02_1,"Cimmander,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_2,Anos said...
m_ex_marian_P_02_3,she received your permission to use the freezer.
m_ex_marian_P_02_4,Is that true?
m_ex_marian_P_02_5,"Yes, it is."
m_ex_marian_P_02_6,"Oh, so it's true."
m_ex_marian_P_02_7,Umm...
m_ex_marian_P_02_8,Well...
m_ex_marian_P_02_9,Can I use the freezer too?
m_ex_marian_P_02_10,Can I eat the freezer like Anis?
m_ex_marian_P_02_11,You can't eat a freezer.
m_ex_marian_P_02_12,???
m_ex_marian_P_02_13,I'm not gonna eate the freezer!
m_ex_marian_P_02_14,"I meant ""use""!"
m_ex_marian_P_02_15,I know.
m_ex_marian_P_02_16,Hahaha.
m_ex_marian_P_02_17,I'm so glad you trustes me!
m_ex_marian_P_02_18,Also...
m_ex_marian_P_02_19,I'm happy that you'll let me use the freezer.
m_ex_marian_P_02_20,"In the future,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_21,I'll keep lotes of things in the freezer.
m_ex_marian_P_02_22,"Water, bread,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_23,"chocolate,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_24,"flour,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_25,"and underpants,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_26,just like Anis!
m_ex_marian_P_02_27,???
m_ex_marian_P_02_28,????
m_ex_marian_P_02_29,One of those things is not like the other...
m_ex_marian_P_02_30,??
m_ex_marian_P_02_31,Did I say something weird?
m_ex_marian_P_02_32,I'm not gonna keep anything strange in the freeezer!
m_ex_marian_P_02_33,"Anis said you should only put important things in there,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_34,so that's what Im going to do.
m_ex_marian_P_02_35,"Hey, now that I think about it,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_36,"you're important too, arne't you Commenader?"
m_ex_marian_P_02_37,Should you go in the freezer too?
m_ex_marian_P_02_38,"Sorry, no important people are allowed inside the freezer."
m_ex_marian_P_02_39,Why not?
m_ex_marian_P_02_40,Because it'll be freezing.
m_ex_marian_P_02_41,That's not right!
m_ex_marian_P_02_42,"Since you're such a ""warm"" person,"
m_ex_marian_P_02_43,I'm sure you'd manage just fine!
m_ex_marian_P_02_44,"All right, let's drop it."
m_ex_marian_P_02_45,"Just don't go in there, okay?"
m_ex_marian_P_02_46,Okay.
m_ex_marian_P_02_47,Hahaha.
m_ex_marian_P_02_48,I've gotta go put my things in the freezer.
m_ex_marian_P_02_49,"Later, Commander!"
m_ex_marian_P_02_50,Goodbye.
m_ex_marian_P_03_1,"Commsnder,"
m_ex_marian_P_03_2,are you there?
m_ex_marian_P_03_3,"If you are, luff..."

m_ex_marian_P_03_5,"Yeh, luff..."
m_ex_marian_P_03_6,Hahahaha.

m_ex_marian_P_03_14,"Are your hands up, Cimmander?"
m_ex_marian_P_03_15,Figured I'd ask since I can't see you.
m_ex_marian_P_03_16,Got 'em up high.
m_ex_marian_P_03_17,Really? Great!
m_ex_marian_P_03_18,Thanks for playing along!
m_ex_marian_P_03_19,Hahahaha.
m_ex_marian_P_03_20,Ra
m_ex_marian_P_03_21,pi told me
m_ex_marian_P_03_22,"to practice typing, and I can type whatever I want."
m_ex_marian_P_03_23,Hehe.
m_ex_marian_P_03_24,That's why I sent that message just now.
m_ex_marian_P_03_25,Good job.
m_ex_marian_P_03_26,Hahahaha.
m_ex_marian_P_03_27,I'm glad you liked it!
m_ex_marian_P_03_28,I really enojy messaging you
m_ex_marian_P_03_29,Commmande.
m_ex_marian_P_03_30,"But,"
m_ex_marian_P_03_31,"I'm gonna hve to stop here,"
m_ex_marian_P_03_32,cause typing gives me a headache.
m_ex_marian_P_03_33,"Also, I'd rather meet face to faec anyway."
m_ex_marian_P_03_34,Can I come see you?
m_ex_marian_P_03_35,"Sure, come on over."
m_ex_marian_P_03_36,Okay!
m_ex_marian_P_03_37,I'll be there in a minute!!
m_ex_mary_01_1,*Knock knock* Are you there?
m_ex_mary_01_2,Yes.
m_ex_mary_01_3,"Haha, here you are!"
m_ex_mary_01_4,"Hi there, Commander."
m_ex_mary_01_5,We're finally together.
m_ex_mary_01_6,Finally?
m_ex_mary_01_7,Yes.
m_ex_mary_01_8,"Everyone says it's nice to go on a mission with you, Commander."
m_ex_mary_01_9,The rumors are everywhere.
m_ex_mary_01_10,I've never heard of that before.
m_ex_mary_01_11,Really?
m_ex_mary_01_12,That's weird.
m_ex_mary_01_13,"Nikkes, who come to our hospital, always talk about it."
m_ex_mary_01_14,"Anyway,"
m_ex_mary_01_15,the rumors don't matter.
m_ex_mary_01_16,What really matters is that I'm finally going to experience it myself!
m_ex_mary_01_17,I see.
m_ex_mary_01_18,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_01_19,"since you're now with me,"
m_ex_mary_01_20,please let me know if you ever feel uncomfortable with anything.
m_ex_mary_01_21,Understand?
m_ex_mary_01_22,That sounds scary.
m_ex_mary_01_23,"C'mon, hahaha."
m_ex_mary_01_24,Don't be afraid of the doctor ^^
m_ex_mary_01_25,I'm not going to give you a painful injection ^^
m_ex_mary_01_26,I'll try my best to stay healthy.
m_ex_mary_01_27,"Well, that's good to hear."
m_ex_mary_01_28,"To get you to be more determined,"
m_ex_mary_01_29,I'll need to prepare more really painful shots.
m_ex_mary_01_30,You just mentioned you weren't going to do that.
m_ex_mary_01_31,"Hahaha, did I mention that before?"
m_ex_mary_01_32,"Yeah, I have it on record."
m_ex_mary_01_33,"Wow, you're right."
m_ex_mary_01_34,There is no response for a long time.
m_ex_mary_01_35,Mary?
m_ex_mary_01_36,Huh? It seems that I can't recall those messages after sending them.
m_ex_mary_01_37,What a pity. I can't destroy the evidence ^^
m_ex_mary_01_38,I'll just have to be careful next time ^^
m_ex_mary_01_39,Careful in destroying evidence?
m_ex_mary_01_40,"Hahaha, there's no way to do that."
m_ex_mary_01_41,I'll let you off the hook for now.
m_ex_mary_01_42,Please don't hurt me in the future.
m_ex_mary_01_43,We'll see about that. Hahaha.
m_ex_mary_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_02_2,are you busy?
m_ex_mary_02_3,I was resting.
m_ex_mary_02_4,"Oh, that's nice!"
m_ex_mary_02_5,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_02_6,are the buildings in the Outpost
m_ex_mary_02_7,inspected at regular intervals?
m_ex_mary_02_8,Honestly... no. I've really had my hands full lately.
m_ex_mary_02_9,I see.
m_ex_mary_02_10,"The hospital has been getting low water pressure for the past few days,"
m_ex_mary_02_11,and now there's no water at all!
m_ex_mary_02_12,We're experiencing low water pressure in the dorm showers too.
m_ex_mary_02_13,Isn't having no water at the hospital a big deal?
m_ex_mary_02_14,Hehehe
m_ex_mary_02_15,That's right.
m_ex_mary_02_16,But you DO realize
m_ex_mary_02_17,there's a big difference between no running showers
m_ex_mary_02_18,and a hospital not having any running water?
m_ex_mary_02_19,Clean water is essential for our patients.
m_ex_mary_02_20,It's a very big deal.
m_ex_mary_02_21,Clean water is essential for our patients.
m_ex_mary_02_22,I'm just glad that you're not out in the field today.
m_ex_mary_02_23,If you were injured during a mission
m_ex_mary_02_24,"on a day without any running water,"
m_ex_mary_02_25,we'd have to delay the surgery.
m_ex_mary_02_26,That could cause the wounds to fester.
m_ex_mary_02_27,"If that were to happen, we'd have to..."
m_ex_mary_02_28,I'll go and check it out right now.
m_ex_mary_02_29,I'll get in touch with Mighty Tools right away.
m_ex_mary_02_30,"Will you be able to fix it right away, Commander?"
m_ex_mary_02_31,There's no telling when our next patient will come in.
m_ex_mary_02_32,I'm hoping we can get this resolved as soon as possible T^T
m_ex_mary_02_33,I'll get in touch with Mighty Tools right away.
m_ex_mary_02_34,Ah!
m_ex_mary_02_35,"That'd be great, hehe!"
m_ex_mary_02_36,I feel like I can rest easy now.
m_ex_mary_02_37,I just hope we don't get any critical cases in the meantime.
m_ex_mary_02_38,Thanks for your help!
m_ex_mary_02_39,... I decided to inspect all the buildings in the Outpost as soon as possible.
m_ex_mary_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_03_2,we've had an uptick in patients suffering from depression.
m_ex_mary_03_3,How are you feeling?
m_ex_mary_03_4,I don't have time to be depressed.
m_ex_mary_03_5,"Not bad, I guess."
m_ex_mary_03_6,"Haha, impressive!"
m_ex_mary_03_7,You're lucky to be surrounded by good friends.
m_ex_mary_03_8,What do you mean by that?
m_ex_mary_03_9,"You've got a great support group around you,"
m_ex_mary_03_10,so you'll be fine.
m_ex_mary_03_11,"What about you, Mary?"
m_ex_mary_03_12,Me?
m_ex_mary_03_13,I've been pretty swamped myself.
m_ex_mary_03_14,"I've also got Pepper to look after, so I can't afford to be depressed."
m_ex_mary_03_15,That's good.
m_ex_mary_03_16,I think so too.
m_ex_mary_03_17,I hope everyone in the world
m_ex_mary_03_18,can be content with who they are and with their own lives.
m_ex_mary_03_19,"If you just look around,"
m_ex_mary_03_20,you'll find many people who are willing to help.
m_ex_mary_03_21,"If you ever feel you need someone to talk to,"
m_ex_mary_03_22,Pepper and I are just a phone call away.
m_ex_mary_03_23,Just having someone to listen can be a big help! ^^
m_ex_mary_03_24,Okay.
m_ex_mary_03_25,"Well, I should be going then."
m_ex_mary_03_26,Pepper is looking for me.
m_ex_mary_03_27,I'll send you a message later.
m_ex_maxwell_01_1,Cutey!
m_ex_maxwell_01_2,Syuen told me to be with you.
m_ex_maxwell_01_3,Is that so?
m_ex_maxwell_01_4,Yes.
m_ex_maxwell_01_5,Ha
m_ex_maxwell_01_6,Haha
m_ex_maxwell_01_7,Hahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_01_8,Hahahahahahahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_01_9,All right.
m_ex_maxwell_01_10,"Then, my Cutey, you can be"
m_ex_maxwell_01_11,"my test subject this entire day,"
m_ex_maxwell_01_12,right?
m_ex_maxwell_01_13,Not really.
m_ex_maxwell_01_14,Why?
m_ex_maxwell_01_15,I was really looking forward to this!
m_ex_maxwell_01_16,Mission first.
m_ex_maxwell_01_17,"Oh, right."
m_ex_maxwell_01_18,Of course.
m_ex_maxwell_01_19,"But if you don't help me,"
m_ex_maxwell_01_20,My Cutey won't be excited.
m_ex_maxwell_01_21,That will only mean it won't fire to its maximum capacity.
m_ex_maxwell_01_22,Isn't that fine?
m_ex_maxwell_01_23,No.
m_ex_maxwell_01_24,Why don't we have just a test or two?
m_ex_maxwell_01_25,Just one or two.
m_ex_maxwell_01_26,"Okay... I've never lied to you, right?"
m_ex_maxwell_01_27,Do you even have a conscience?
m_ex_maxwell_01_28,Hahahaha! Well...
m_ex_maxwell_01_29,"Looking forward to working with you, Cutey!"
m_ex_maxwell_02_1,Cutey!
m_ex_maxwell_02_2,Are you there?
m_ex_maxwell_02_3,Tell Drake to do it.
m_ex_maxwell_02_4,Tell Laplace to do it.
m_ex_maxwell_02_5,Huh?
m_ex_maxwell_02_6,What are you talking about?
m_ex_maxwell_02_7,I didn't even say anything!
m_ex_maxwell_02_8,"Also, she is of no help to my research."
m_ex_maxwell_02_9,"Let me guess, you want to do a test?"
m_ex_maxwell_02_10,"Unfortunately, no."
m_ex_maxwell_02_11,Then what is it?
m_ex_maxwell_02_12,Did you see my research notes the last time you were here?
m_ex_maxwell_02_13,"I'm positive I placed them on the lab bench,"
m_ex_maxwell_02_14,but it vanished in a blink of an eye.
m_ex_maxwell_02_15,I was wondering if you were hiding them from me.
m_ex_maxwell_02_16,I wouldn't do such a thing.
m_ex_maxwell_02_17,I suppose so.
m_ex_maxwell_02_18,There's no reason for you do to something like that.
m_ex_maxwell_02_19,This isn't good.
m_ex_maxwell_02_20,I kept all my research journals in there.
m_ex_maxwell_02_21,So you'll have to start from scratch again?
m_ex_maxwell_02_22,What if I can't find it?
m_ex_maxwell_02_23,Hahahahahahahahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_02_24,I'm sensing some anger here.
m_ex_maxwell_02_25,It has to be in the research lab somewhere.
m_ex_maxwell_02_26,Let's stay calm about this.
m_ex_maxwell_02_27,Hahahahahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_02_28,I hope you'll find it.
m_ex_maxwell_02_29,"Thanks, Cutey."
m_ex_maxwell_02_30,You seem very sincere.
m_ex_maxwell_02_31,"Well, I'm off to search for it."
m_ex_maxwell_02_32,"After all, I can't run more tests on you until I find those notes!"
m_ex_maxwell_02_33,I'm sure it wouldn't take me long to find it.
m_ex_maxwell_02_34,I'll be in touch if I find the notes ;)
m_ex_maxwell_03_1,"Cutey,"
m_ex_maxwell_03_2,who do you think is worse?
m_ex_maxwell_03_3,Laplace or Drake?
m_ex_maxwell_03_4,Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
m_ex_maxwell_03_5,Just answer the question.
m_ex_maxwell_03_6,... That's a tough one.
m_ex_maxwell_03_7,Always hollering about hero this and hero that.
m_ex_maxwell_03_8,Running around like a bull in a china shop.
m_ex_maxwell_03_9,Is it Laplace with her hero fixation?
m_ex_maxwell_03_10,Or can it be Drake
m_ex_maxwell_03_11,who is always prattling on about how she's a villain
m_ex_maxwell_03_12,and starting fights but running with her tail between her legs
m_ex_maxwell_03_13,the moment someone fights back?
m_ex_maxwell_03_14,Who should I pick?
m_ex_maxwell_03_15,"Hmmm, you can't seem to give me an answer?"
m_ex_maxwell_03_16,That's a tough question.
m_ex_maxwell_03_17,"I know, right?"
m_ex_maxwell_03_18,It's a real doozy.
m_ex_maxwell_03_19,Even I think so too.
m_ex_maxwell_03_20,Is something the matter?
m_ex_maxwell_03_21,"It's nothing, really."
m_ex_maxwell_03_22,They were just making a big stink today
m_ex_maxwell_03_23,"and being a nuisance, so it got me thinking..."
m_ex_maxwell_03_24,Who is worse?
m_ex_maxwell_03_25,So...
m_ex_maxwell_03_26,Hehehehehe
m_ex_maxwell_03_27,So who did you choose?
m_ex_maxwell_03_28,Me?
m_ex_maxwell_03_29,Hehehehehehehe
m_ex_maxwell_03_30,"I just told you, didn't I?"
m_ex_maxwell_03_31,This is a real brainbuster.
m_ex_maxwell_03_32,There's no way I can choose.
m_ex_maxwell_03_33,Hahahahahahahahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_03_34,Hahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_03_35,Sigh...
m_ex_maxwell_03_36,I feel somewhat relieved
m_ex_maxwell_03_37,to hear that
m_ex_maxwell_03_38,you can't make up your mind as well.
m_ex_maxwell_03_39,"Personally, I hate it when I can't come to a conclusion."
m_ex_maxwell_03_40,It doesn't matter how hard I rack my brain and
m_ex_maxwell_03_41,how much I compare the two of them.
m_ex_maxwell_03_42,"Whenever I think one may possess more strengths,"
m_ex_maxwell_03_43,I'd think of a fatal flaw that offsets all those strengths.
m_ex_maxwell_03_44,I really can't decide!
m_ex_maxwell_03_45,Hehehehehe
m_ex_maxwell_03_46,Hahahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_03_47,Sigh...
m_ex_maxwell_03_48,"It's funny, isn't it?"
m_ex_maxwell_03_49,"Now, now, don't be so bummed out."
m_ex_maxwell_03_50,It's not like being around those two is anything new to me.
m_ex_maxwell_03_51,I'm used to it by now.
m_ex_maxwell_03_52,Hahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_03_53,I haven't had a good laugh like this in ages!
m_ex_maxwell_03_54,I have you to thank for that.
m_ex_maxwell_03_55,Hahahaha
m_ex_maxwell_03_56,I'll be in touch the next time I think of something amusing.
m_ex_mica_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_mica_01_2,My name is Mica.
m_ex_mica_01_3,I was wondering whether you're with my friend.
m_ex_mica_01_4,That's why I contacted you.
m_ex_mica_01_5,Your friend?
m_ex_mica_01_6,Yes!
m_ex_mica_01_7,"We're friends who used to play together,"
m_ex_mica_01_8,"from a long, long time ago!"
m_ex_mica_01_9,"Every time she sees me, she'll always pull a prank on me."
m_ex_mica_01_10,She'll hide somewhere and jump out to scare me.
m_ex_mica_01_11,She'll give me tasty food but always add loads of hot sauce to it.
m_ex_mica_01_12,She'll even put Ice Splendamin on my back.
m_ex_mica_01_13,That's the kind of friend she is!
m_ex_mica_01_14,Aren't you being bullied by that friend of yours?
m_ex_mica_01_15,?
m_ex_mica_01_16,"No, definitely not!"
m_ex_mica_01_17,"She just likes to mess around, but she's actually very kind!"
m_ex_mica_01_18,You'll come to realize that she's a nice person after getting to know her.
m_ex_mica_01_19,I really enjoy hanging out with her! >.<
m_ex_mica_01_20,"I mean, for real. Please believe me!"
m_ex_mica_01_21,I do.
m_ex_mica_01_22,I'm glad we cleared up that misunderstanding. Hahaha.
m_ex_mica_01_23,So...
m_ex_mica_01_24,I was wondering...
m_ex_mica_01_25,if we can be together this time...
m_ex_mica_01_26,"That's why, I contacted you."
m_ex_mica_01_27,Is...
m_ex_mica_01_28,Is it okay if I ask you this sort of question?
m_ex_mica_01_29,Of course.
m_ex_mica_01_30,Hahahaha.
m_ex_mica_01_31,That's a relief.
m_ex_mica_01_32,"I was worried that my friend might get mad at me
for asking useless questions."
m_ex_mica_01_33,"So, what's the name of your friend?"
m_ex_mica_01_34,Belorta!
m_ex_mica_01_35,Is Belorta with you?
m_ex_mica_01_36,Yes.
m_ex_mica_01_37,Nope.
m_ex_mica_01_38,"Wow, we can be together too!"
m_ex_mica_01_39,"Hahaha, that's good news!"
m_ex_mica_01_40,That's awesome!
m_ex_mica_01_41,"Hahaha, yes! It's awesome!"
m_ex_mica_01_42,"It's all thanks to you, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_01_43,"Oh, that's a pity."
m_ex_mica_01_44,I thought we'd be together this time too.
m_ex_mica_01_45,I'll keep trying so that we can be with Belorta next time.
m_ex_mica_01_46,Really?
m_ex_mica_01_47,Thank you!
m_ex_mica_01_48,LOL
m_ex_mica_01_49,I've asked everything I wanted to know.
m_ex_mica_01_50,That's all!
m_ex_mica_01_51,See you next time.
m_ex_mica_01_52,Okay! See you next time!
m_ex_mica_02_1,"Hey, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_02_2,Can I ask you something?
m_ex_mica_02_3,Ask away.
m_ex_mica_02_4,Which do you like more?
m_ex_mica_02_5,Eating...
m_ex_mica_02_6,or fireworks?
m_ex_mica_02_7,I made a bet with Belorta
m_ex_mica_02_8,and she said you'd like eating more!
m_ex_mica_02_9,"My money's on you liking fireworks more, hehehe."
m_ex_mica_02_10,So I'm curious which one
m_ex_mica_02_11,comes out on top! ^____^
m_ex_mica_02_12,I like eating more.
m_ex_mica_02_13,I like fireworks more.
m_ex_mica_02_14,!!
m_ex_mica_02_15,"Aw man, I thought for sure you'd prefer fireworks."
m_ex_mica_02_16,Belorta was right... Go figures.
m_ex_mica_02_17,"Well, she'll be happy when she hears this at any rate."
m_ex_mica_02_18,!!
m_ex_mica_02_19,I knew it! I knew you'd prefer fireworks.
m_ex_mica_02_20,Um...
m_ex_mica_02_21,"If Belorta comes and asks you the same question,"
m_ex_mica_02_22,can you tell her that you like eating more?
m_ex_mica_02_23,She might be disappointed otherwise.
m_ex_mica_02_24,"To be honest, I like both."
m_ex_mica_02_25,Whoa! Really?
m_ex_mica_02_26,You really do like both?
m_ex_mica_02_27,Definitely. I can't really choose which is better.
m_ex_mica_02_28,That's great!
m_ex_mica_02_29,That means Belorta and I are tied!
m_ex_mica_02_30,Just wait till Belorta hears this! Hehehe!
m_ex_mica_02_31,She's gonna flip!
m_ex_mica_02_32,"Thanks, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_02_33,Let's talk again soon.
m_ex_mica_02_34,Sure thing. Until next time.
m_ex_mica_02_35,"Take care of yourself, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_03_1,"Hi, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_03_2,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_mica_03_3,No.
m_ex_mica_03_4,Perfect.
m_ex_mica_03_5,I'm just hanging around the Toy Shop.
m_ex_mica_03_6,"There aren't any customers around, so I'm bored stiff. T^T"
m_ex_mica_03_7,Yeah?
m_ex_mica_03_8,Yep.
m_ex_mica_03_9,Any ideas to whip up some more customers?
m_ex_mica_03_10,I wanna show off all these cute toys to people.
m_ex_mica_03_11,"Buy one, get one free sale."
m_ex_mica_03_12,50% off mega sale.
m_ex_mica_03_13,Wow!
m_ex_mica_03_14,Great idea!
m_ex_mica_03_15,But we usually give people lots of freebies even if they just buy one of something.
m_ex_mica_03_16,Wow!
m_ex_mica_03_17,Great idea!
m_ex_mica_03_18,"But our prices are already so low, I'm not sure we can afford cutting them by half."
m_ex_mica_03_19,I'll have to run it past Belorta.
m_ex_mica_03_20,"If the sale brings in a lot of customers,"
m_ex_mica_03_21,I'm sure she'd be pleased.
m_ex_mica_03_22,"Thanks, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_03_23,Good luck!
m_ex_mihara_01_1,"Hello, Commander."
m_ex_mihara_01_2,What do you have scheduled for today?
m_ex_mihara_01_3,Nothing special.
m_ex_mihara_01_4,So can you give me a hand?
m_ex_mihara_01_5,"It's nothing too major, really."
m_ex_mihara_01_6,"Just that my order arrived, so I tried it on."
m_ex_mihara_01_7,But I'm not really impressed with it.
m_ex_mihara_01_8,"It seems like it would be more effective if
someone else used it on me."
m_ex_mihara_01_9,So I thought maybe you could give me a little helping hand?
m_ex_mihara_01_10,What did you buy?
m_ex_mihara_01_11,"Well, it's nothing special."
m_ex_mihara_01_12,It's something like a massager.
m_ex_mihara_01_13,You'll just have to use it on my body.
m_ex_mihara_01_14,I see...?
m_ex_mihara_01_15,Ah.
m_ex_mihara_01_16,Do you happen to have any insulating gloves or something?
m_ex_mihara_01_17,Why do I need insulating gloves?
m_ex_mihara_01_18,Because what I bought this time performs better.
m_ex_mihara_01_19,But occasionally...
m_ex_mihara_01_20,"I mean, occasionally, it may not work properly."
m_ex_mihara_01_21,It might give the user an electric shock.
m_ex_mihara_01_22,Electric shock?
m_ex_mihara_01_23,Yes.
m_ex_mihara_01_24,"So in case of an accident,"
m_ex_mihara_01_25,you better be wearing some insulating gloves.
m_ex_mihara_01_26,Did you just buy a...
m_ex_mihara_01_27,"Yes, you thought right ♡"
m_ex_mihara_01_28,I just remembered that I have an appointment today.
m_ex_mihara_01_29,"Oh,"
m_ex_mihara_01_30,is that so?
m_ex_mihara_01_31,"Well, maybe next time."
m_ex_mihara_01_32,Hmmm...
m_ex_mihara_01_33,Will it be too difficult for a beginner to use?
m_ex_mihara_01_34,"If you want to try it in the future,"
m_ex_mihara_01_35,just contact me.
m_ex_mihara_01_36,I'll wait for you ♡
m_ex_mihara_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mihara_02_2,what are you up to? Are you busy?
m_ex_mihara_02_3,I was resting.
m_ex_mihara_02_4,Hope I didn't disturb you.
m_ex_mihara_02_5,I was just reaching out because I'm bored.
m_ex_mihara_02_6,Yuni left a moment ago.
m_ex_mihara_02_7,I see.
m_ex_mihara_02_8,"Yep, yep."
m_ex_mihara_02_9,Um... Commander...
m_ex_mihara_02_10,Thank you.
m_ex_mihara_02_11,Where'd that come from?
m_ex_mihara_02_12,I've always wanted to say that to you.
m_ex_mihara_02_13,"Ever since Yuni met you, she's just lit up."
m_ex_mihara_02_14,I'm really all that Yuni has.
m_ex_mihara_02_15,She lives a sheltered life
m_ex_mihara_02_16,and knowing even one new person
m_ex_mihara_02_17,means the world to her.
m_ex_mihara_02_18,So I wanted to thank you.
m_ex_mihara_02_19,"What about you, Mihara?"
m_ex_mihara_02_20,Huh? Me?
m_ex_mihara_02_21,"I know it's good for Yuni, but what about you?"
m_ex_mihara_02_22,"Aww, are you concerned about me?"
m_ex_mihara_02_23,You're sweet.
m_ex_mihara_02_24,Knowing you have brought me happiness as well.
m_ex_mihara_02_25,Someone who takes you for who you are
m_ex_mihara_02_26,is hard to come by.
m_ex_mihara_02_27,"Commander, our relationship is one"
m_ex_mihara_02_28,that cannot be explained in mere words.
m_ex_mihara_02_29,Thank you for the compliment.
m_ex_mihara_02_30,My pleasure.
m_ex_mihara_02_31,I should go and meet up with Yuni.
m_ex_mihara_02_32,Thanks for your time.
m_ex_mihara_02_33,Let's hang out with Yuni next time.
m_ex_mihara_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mihara_03_2,I was thinking of getting a gift for Yuni.
m_ex_mihara_03_3,What do you think I should get her?
m_ex_mihara_03_4,You're the greatest gift she can ever have.
m_ex_mihara_03_5,A new set of handcuffs and some whips.
m_ex_mihara_03_6,You're sweet ♡
m_ex_mihara_03_7,"I'm sure that is how Yuni feels,"
m_ex_mihara_03_8,which brings a smile to my face.
m_ex_mihara_03_9,Yuni already has plenty of those.
m_ex_mihara_03_10,"Sure, if I bought new ones for her, she'd use them plenty, but"
m_ex_mihara_03_11,I want to get her something special.
m_ex_mihara_03_12,"Ah, I thought of a great gift."
m_ex_mihara_03_13,What is it?
m_ex_mihara_03_14,"Curious, eh?"
m_ex_mihara_03_15,I'll need a human volunteer and a big box.
m_ex_mihara_03_16,"First, the human"
m_ex_mihara_03_17,goes inside the box.
m_ex_mihara_03_18,"Oh, yeah! A ribbon around their neck would be a nice touch too ♡"
m_ex_mihara_03_19,"Later, when Yuni opens the box,"
m_ex_mihara_03_20,she'll be so thrilled!
m_ex_mihara_03_21,And who's the volunteer going to be?
m_ex_mihara_03_22,The one who's chatting with me
m_ex_mihara_03_23,on blabla right now.
m_ex_mihara_03_24,!!
m_ex_mihara_03_25,Commander.
m_ex_mihara_03_26,"You'll do me a solid, won't you?"
m_ex_mihara_03_27,Come to the club tonight.
m_ex_mihara_03_28,I'll be waiting ♡
m_ex_milk_01_1,"Pal,"
m_ex_milk_01_2,are you the new Commander?
m_ex_milk_01_3,That's me.
m_ex_milk_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_milk_01_5,"I'm Milk, from the Cafe Sweety Squad."
m_ex_milk_01_6,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_milk_01_7,Are you good at fighting
m_ex_milk_01_8,by any chance?
m_ex_milk_01_9,Fighting?
m_ex_milk_01_10,Yeah.
m_ex_milk_01_11,"Oh, wait!"
m_ex_milk_01_12,It must be kinda off-putting
m_ex_milk_01_13,"bringing this up right when we've first met, right?"
m_ex_milk_01_14,"Sorry, I'm just a big fan of combat sports."
m_ex_milk_01_15,I like them too.
m_ex_milk_01_16,No way!
m_ex_milk_01_17,"Well, we have at least one thing in common."
m_ex_milk_01_18,Perhaps we can find some time to put our fighting skills to the test.
m_ex_milk_01_19,I'll treat you to a Milk Coffee afterward.
m_ex_milk_01_20,Sounds like a plan.
m_ex_milk_01_21,See you around then.
m_ex_milk_02_1,"Hey, Pal."
m_ex_milk_02_2,What is it about coffee that you enjoy the most?
m_ex_milk_02_3,What makes you ask?
m_ex_milk_02_4,Well...
m_ex_milk_02_5,a customer came to our Cafe
m_ex_milk_02_6,and asked me for my recommendation.
m_ex_milk_02_7,"So, I naturally suggested milk coffee,"
m_ex_milk_02_8,but then she asked me for the reasons!
m_ex_milk_02_9,"I turned to her and said,"
m_ex_milk_02_10,"""Because it tastes the best, that's why!"""
m_ex_milk_02_11,You know what happened next?
m_ex_milk_02_12,She said she wasn't convinced
m_ex_milk_02_13,and ended up getting a different coffee.
m_ex_milk_02_14,"Unbelievable! It's tasty, so"
m_ex_milk_02_15,what other reasons do you need?
m_ex_milk_02_16,"If things keep up like this,"
m_ex_milk_02_17,I'm gonna end up way behind everyone else at work.
m_ex_milk_02_18,So I need to think of reasons to give people.
m_ex_milk_02_19,I see.
m_ex_milk_02_20,That's why I thought to ask you.
m_ex_milk_02_21,So what do you think?
m_ex_milk_02_22,"How about telling them, ""Because it has my name on it!"""
m_ex_milk_02_23,"Tell them it's not too sweet nor bitter, but just perfect."
m_ex_milk_02_24,Oh.
m_ex_milk_02_25,Huh?!
m_ex_milk_02_26,Hehehehehe.
m_ex_milk_02_27,"It's a little embarrassing, but it's a confidence booster for sure."
m_ex_milk_02_28,"I get what you're saying,"
m_ex_milk_02_29,but just saying it's tasty may be better than
m_ex_milk_02_30,bragging to the customer
m_ex_milk_02_31,about how it's great because my name's on it.
m_ex_milk_02_32,Anything else?
m_ex_milk_02_33,"Tell them it's not too sweet or bitter, but just perfect."
m_ex_milk_02_34,Hey now!
m_ex_milk_02_35,That's the one.
m_ex_milk_02_36,Coffee shouldn't be too sweet
m_ex_milk_02_37,and people are divisive when it comes to super bitter coffee.
m_ex_milk_02_38,My coffee is perfect for everyone!
m_ex_milk_02_39,That's what makes milk coffee so special!
m_ex_milk_02_40,"Thanks, Pal."
m_ex_milk_02_41,"Next time you stop by, coffee's on me."
m_ex_milk_02_42,"Milk coffee, of course!"
m_ex_milk_02_43,"Haha, all right."
m_ex_milk_03_1,"Pal,"
m_ex_milk_03_2,"if you have time, help me come up with an alias."
m_ex_milk_03_3,With a what now?
m_ex_milk_03_4,An alias!
m_ex_milk_03_5,I just thought it'd be fun to have one.
m_ex_milk_03_6,That's all.
m_ex_milk_03_7,Milk thistle
m_ex_milk_03_8,Milk tea
m_ex_milk_03_9,Are you looking for a fight?
m_ex_milk_03_10,Cause I'm about to throw hands.
m_ex_milk_03_11,Can't you come up with anything better than that?
m_ex_milk_03_12,Sorry.
m_ex_milk_03_13,"Fine. Since you apologized so quickly, I'll forgive you."
m_ex_milk_03_14,I said I wanted an alias!
m_ex_milk_03_15,What kind of alias has your actual name in it?!
m_ex_milk_03_16,I thought you'd be able to come up with something unique.
m_ex_milk_03_17,"All right, let me think of a good one."
m_ex_milk_03_18,All right...
m_ex_milk_03_19,I'll give you another chance.
m_ex_milk_03_20,Millet
m_ex_milk_03_21,Million
m_ex_milk_03_22,...
m_ex_milk_03_23,What do you think?
m_ex_milk_03_24,Where are you now?
m_ex_milk_03_25,In your room?
m_ex_milk_03_26,Stay right there. I'm coming over.
m_ex_milk_03_27,I better get out of here.
m_ex_miranda_01_1,"Hello, Commander!!!"
m_ex_miranda_01_2,I received an order
m_ex_miranda_01_3,to work with you from now on!!!
m_ex_miranda_01_4,I think you're being too excited about it.
m_ex_miranda_01_5,"Ah, really?"
m_ex_miranda_01_6,How relaxed should I be?
m_ex_miranda_01_7,It'll be much better if you take out two exclamation marks.
m_ex_miranda_01_8,Is that so?
m_ex_miranda_01_9,Understood!
m_ex_miranda_01_10,"From now on, I will use only one exclamation mark to show my passion when working with you."
m_ex_miranda_01_11,Understood!
m_ex_miranda_01_12,Understood-
m_ex_miranda_01_13,"Commander, do you also use one exclamation mark to show your passion?"
m_ex_miranda_01_14,That's awesome!
m_ex_miranda_01_15,"The ""-"" symbol..."
m_ex_miranda_01_16,Are you telling me we need to express our passion normally?
m_ex_miranda_01_17,"Yes, just keep it cool."
m_ex_miranda_01_18,The normal level of passion is also very cool!
m_ex_miranda_01_19,So!
m_ex_miranda_01_20,I have a few questions for you!
m_ex_miranda_01_21,Say it.
m_ex_miranda_01_22,What should I prepare for a mission?
m_ex_miranda_01_23,Reflective vest!
m_ex_miranda_01_24,LED tripods!
m_ex_miranda_01_25,Traffic baton!
m_ex_miranda_01_26,Please tell me!
m_ex_miranda_01_27,Aren't those things for traffic management?
m_ex_miranda_01_28,Yes!
m_ex_miranda_01_29,They are my trusty friends that I can't go without!
m_ex_miranda_01_30,"Ah, I almost forgot another thing."
m_ex_miranda_01_31,A traffic sign!
m_ex_miranda_01_32,Why do you have a traffic sign?
m_ex_miranda_01_33,"Oh, that's because"
m_ex_miranda_01_34,"when I was guiding citizens across the street the last time,"
m_ex_miranda_01_35,I noticed that they didn't follow the signs and just passed by!
m_ex_miranda_01_36,So I held one traffic sign in my hand to attract their attention!
m_ex_miranda_01_37,Then Poli told me to just keep the sign
m_ex_miranda_01_38,as I've already taken it!
m_ex_miranda_01_39,"So since then, that sign has been mine!"
m_ex_miranda_01_40,I see.
m_ex_miranda_01_41,That's it!
m_ex_miranda_01_42,So which one should I take with me?
m_ex_miranda_01_43,None of them.
m_ex_miranda_01_44,What?
m_ex_miranda_01_45,But... Why???
m_ex_miranda_01_46,Because most of our missions are carried out on the surface.
m_ex_miranda_01_47,"Oh, right."
m_ex_miranda_01_48,The surface.
m_ex_miranda_01_49,I almost forgot most of the missions are done on the surface.
m_ex_miranda_01_50,"So, there's really no need for traffic management."
m_ex_miranda_01_51,"Well, if that's the case, there's nothing I can prepare for."
m_ex_miranda_01_52,I'm such a fool.
m_ex_miranda_01_53,But you have to bring your gun.
m_ex_miranda_01_54,!!!
m_ex_miranda_01_55,"Right, I need to bring my gun!"
m_ex_miranda_01_56,I'll take the gun with me!
m_ex_miranda_01_57,"Thank you for your advice, Commander!"
m_ex_miranda_01_58,I'll not forget to bring my gun!
m_ex_miranda_01_59,Okay.
m_ex_miranda_02_1,Commander!
m_ex_miranda_02_2,I need to tell you something.
m_ex_miranda_02_3,"Lend me your ear, will you?"
m_ex_miranda_02_4,"Sure, go ahead!"
m_ex_miranda_02_5,I'm at a cafe buying some coffee.
m_ex_miranda_02_6,"Since I'm here, I was thinking of buying one for Poli as well, but"
m_ex_miranda_02_7,I'm not sure what to get her.
m_ex_miranda_02_8,I asked Poli but I haven't gotten a response.
m_ex_miranda_02_9,Sweet chocolate latte.
m_ex_miranda_02_10,Iced Americano.
m_ex_miranda_02_11,!!
m_ex_miranda_02_12,Chocolate? No way jose!
m_ex_miranda_02_13,"If I gave that to Poli, it'd be a disaster!"
m_ex_miranda_02_14,I think the iced americano is the way to go.
m_ex_miranda_02_15,!!
m_ex_miranda_02_16,Iced americano... That should work.
m_ex_miranda_02_17,"Come to think of it, Poli is always yawning"
m_ex_miranda_02_18,and saying how tired she is.
m_ex_miranda_02_19,I think some caffeine will be a nice shot in the arm for her!
m_ex_miranda_02_20,"Problem solved! Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_miranda_02_21,Did you order?
m_ex_miranda_02_22,"Yep, just placed my order."
m_ex_miranda_02_23,But we've got another problem.
m_ex_miranda_02_24,What is it?
m_ex_miranda_02_25,"I just received a reply from Poli, and"
m_ex_miranda_02_26,she said she wants a
m_ex_miranda_02_27,sweet potato latte!
m_ex_miranda_02_28,This is a disaster!
m_ex_miranda_02_29,Just go and change your order.
m_ex_miranda_02_30,"Excuse me, have you already processed my order?"
m_ex_miranda_02_31,??
m_ex_miranda_02_32,"Agh, sorry Commander!"
m_ex_miranda_02_33,"I meant to send that to the shop assistant, not you!"
m_ex_miranda_02_34,I can't multitask! I'm freaking out right now!
m_ex_miranda_02_35,I'll talk to you later!
m_ex_miranda_02_36,Okay.
m_ex_miranda_03_1,"Commander, I'm in deep trouble!"
m_ex_miranda_03_2,Poli is super angry at me
m_ex_miranda_03_3,and I haven't got a clue why.
m_ex_miranda_03_4,Maybe you did something wrong without knowing it?
m_ex_miranda_03_5,Did you make a foul-up while on the job?
m_ex_miranda_03_6,"I can almost guarantee I did, but"
m_ex_miranda_03_7,there's no way I can narrow down
m_ex_miranda_03_8,which one set her off.
m_ex_miranda_03_9,Maybe it's a straw that broke the camel's back situation.
m_ex_miranda_03_10,So you're saying
m_ex_miranda_03_11,what made her blow a fuse was all the things I've done wrong put together?
m_ex_miranda_03_12,"If it was just one or two mistakes,"
m_ex_miranda_03_13,I was going to try and fix them behind her back and apologize later.
m_ex_miranda_03_14,Don't do it secretly.
m_ex_miranda_03_15,I'm really up against it this time.
m_ex_miranda_03_16,What am I gonna do? T^T
m_ex_miranda_03_17,"When I first came to this department,"
m_ex_miranda_03_18,Poli was my senior officer and really took care of me.
m_ex_miranda_03_19,"Even if I try my best, I still keep screwing up..."
m_ex_miranda_03_20,Everyone's like that at a new job.
m_ex_miranda_03_21,Looking after new recruits is part of Poli's job description.
m_ex_miranda_03_22,You think so?
m_ex_miranda_03_23,"Even if that's true,"
m_ex_miranda_03_24,I want to be more reliable!
m_ex_miranda_03_25,You think so?
m_ex_miranda_03_26,"Even if that's true,"
m_ex_miranda_03_27,I want to be someone Poli can rely on!
m_ex_miranda_03_28,What am I gonna doooooo :'(
m_ex_miranda_03_29,Miranda?
m_ex_miranda_03_30,There's no reply.
m_ex_miranda_03_31,"Sorry about that, Commander!"
m_ex_miranda_03_32,Something came up and we were sent out on dispatch.
m_ex_miranda_03_33,I just returned.
m_ex_miranda_03_34,Some terrorist was trying to push a civilian off a building.
m_ex_miranda_03_35,I ended up defying orders
m_ex_miranda_03_36,so that I could rush over and catch the civilian.
m_ex_miranda_03_37,I thought Poli was going to
m_ex_miranda_03_38,"chew me out again, but..."
m_ex_miranda_03_39,You got off scot-free?
m_ex_miranda_03_40,Yep!
m_ex_miranda_03_41,"Well, not exactly."
m_ex_miranda_03_42,Poli was pretty peeved at first
m_ex_miranda_03_43,"but she eventually said I did well, and even gave me a hug."
m_ex_miranda_03_44,"Honestly, sometimes I don't know what's going on in that head of hers."
m_ex_miranda_03_45,You'll understand when you're responsible for your own new recruit.
m_ex_miranda_03_46,Wow!
m_ex_miranda_03_47,A new recruit under my command!
m_ex_miranda_03_48,"It's hard to imagine right now,"
m_ex_miranda_03_49,"but if it does happen, I'll be really kind to them."
m_ex_miranda_03_50,I'm not a proponent of tough love and stuff like that.
m_ex_miranda_03_51,Just focus on the present for now.
m_ex_miranda_03_52,You'll be quite a sight when that happens. Can't wait to see it.
m_ex_miranda_03_53,You betcha!
m_ex_miranda_03_54,But that's still a ways away.
m_ex_miranda_03_55,You betcha!
m_ex_miranda_03_56,Better mark your calendar!
m_ex_miranda_03_57,"Anyway, Poli is starting to give me some side eye,"
m_ex_miranda_03_58,so I better get back to work.
m_ex_miranda_03_59,Thanks for everything!
m_ex_n102_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_n102_01_2,Uh...
m_ex_n102_01_3,How do I address you again?
m_ex_n102_01_4,I was sure I heard it.
m_ex_n102_01_5,You can call me whatever you want.
m_ex_n102_01_6,Really???
m_ex_n102_01_7,"Then,"
m_ex_n102_01_8,I'll call you Teacher!
m_ex_n102_01_9,Teacher?
m_ex_n102_01_10,Yes!!!
m_ex_n102_01_11,"Well, it's because there's so much that I don't understand."
m_ex_n102_01_12,I have a bad memory as well.
m_ex_n102_01_13,"So, I was hoping that you could teach me a lot."
m_ex_n102_01_14,Is that okay?
m_ex_n102_01_15,Of course.
m_ex_n102_01_16,"Thank you, Teacher!!"
m_ex_n102_01_17,N-102-912710
m_ex_n102_01_18,It says that is my name.
m_ex_n102_01_19,It says?
m_ex_n102_01_20,Yes!!!
m_ex_n102_01_21,I wrote everything down in my notebook because I have a bad memory.
m_ex_n102_01_22,That's such a long name.
m_ex_n102_01_23,You think so?
m_ex_n102_01_24,It says people usually call me N102.
m_ex_n102_01_25,You can also call me that if you want to.
m_ex_n102_01_26,I'll call you Anne.
m_ex_n102_01_27,Anne.
m_ex_n102_01_28,"Haha, okay."
m_ex_n102_01_29,Anne.
m_ex_n102_01_30,Anne.
m_ex_n102_01_31,"Haha, I really like that name. I'll keep saying it and keep writing it down."
m_ex_n102_01_32,"I'm looking forward to working with you, Anne."
m_ex_n102_01_33,"Yes, Teacher!!"
m_ex_n102_02_1,Teacher!
m_ex_n102_02_2,What is it?
m_ex_n102_02_3,Oh!
m_ex_n102_02_4,"I got first place,"
m_ex_n102_02_5,and it's all thanks to you!
m_ex_n102_02_6,What are you talking about?
m_ex_n102_02_7,"Oh right, hehe."
m_ex_n102_02_8,I was playing a game with Anis and Neon.
m_ex_n102_02_9,"We all have to message someone,"
m_ex_n102_02_10,and whoever receives a reply first wins.
m_ex_n102_02_11,The loser has to buy everyone croquettes.
m_ex_n102_02_12,"Since you replied to me so quickly,"
m_ex_n102_02_13,I'm the winner!
m_ex_n102_02_14,I'm happy for you.
m_ex_n102_02_15,"Thanks, heehee!"
m_ex_n102_02_16,Wait a minute.
m_ex_n102_02_17,"After a while, there's another message from N102."
m_ex_n102_02_18,"Anis said messaging you is cheating,"
m_ex_n102_02_19,so this round doesn't count.
m_ex_n102_02_20,"She says we have to play again, but"
m_ex_n102_02_21,you're the only contact in my phone.
m_ex_n102_02_22,I'm totally gonna lose! T^T
m_ex_n102_02_23,Why is texting me considered cheating?
m_ex_n102_02_24,Because you always respond right away ;(
m_ex_n102_02_25,Tell Anis something for me.
m_ex_n102_02_26,Sure?
m_ex_n102_02_27,"Tell her she didn't think of messaging me, so that's her loss."
m_ex_n102_02_28,That's a great idea!
m_ex_n102_02_29,I'll tell her right away.
m_ex_n102_02_30,Hmmm...
m_ex_n102_02_31,"She's not to happy right now, hehehe."
m_ex_n102_02_32,She says she'll concede this round.
m_ex_n102_02_33,"Teacher, you're the best!"
m_ex_n102_02_34,"Next time, I will buy you a croquette."
m_ex_n102_02_35,Thanks.
m_ex_n102_02_36,Anis wants me to play a different game with her.
m_ex_n102_02_37,Gotta go!
m_ex_n102_02_38,Have fun.
m_ex_n102_02_39,Later!
m_ex_n102_03_1,"Teacher, what are you doing?"
m_ex_n102_03_2,Not much. How about you?
m_ex_n102_03_3,"I've got a hankering for some croquette, so"
m_ex_n102_03_4,I'm about to head out now.
m_ex_n102_03_5,Do you enjoy anything other than croquette?
m_ex_n102_03_6,"Hmm, there may have been something once..."
m_ex_n102_03_7,but I can't remember T^T
m_ex_n102_03_8,What about you? What do you like?
m_ex_n102_03_9,Top-tier filet mignon.
m_ex_n102_03_10,"Tuna belly, with lots of fat."
m_ex_n102_03_11,You're making me
m_ex_n102_03_12,want to try some too.
m_ex_n102_03_13,What does it taste like?
m_ex_n102_03_14,It melts in your mouth.
m_ex_n102_03_15,It's as if you've died and gone to heaven.
m_ex_n102_03_16,Woow...
m_ex_n102_03_17,"I've never tasted it myself, but"
m_ex_n102_03_18,the way you describe it sounds amazing!
m_ex_n102_03_19,"For me though,"
m_ex_n102_03_20,nothing beats croquette!
m_ex_n102_03_21,We should go on a culinary trip.
m_ex_n102_03_22,A culinary trip?
m_ex_n102_03_23,It's when you travel to different places and eat the local delicacies.
m_ex_n102_03_24,Holy moly!
m_ex_n102_03_25,That sounds amazing!
m_ex_n102_03_26,Do you want to go?
m_ex_n102_03_27,You bet I do!
m_ex_n102_03_28,Then make your way to the Commander's Room.
m_ex_n102_03_29,Right now?
m_ex_n102_03_30,Are we leaving today?
m_ex_n102_03_31,"When inspiration strikes, you've got to grab it."
m_ex_n102_03_32,"All right, I'm on my way!"
m_ex_n102_03_33,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_neon_01_1,I'm happy.
m_ex_neon_01_2,Lots of people don't understand the path of firepower.
m_ex_neon_01_3,"Until now,"
m_ex_neon_01_4,"I was all alone,"
m_ex_neon_01_5,walking the path on my lonesome.
m_ex_neon_01_6,"That is why I was very happy to see you, Master."
m_ex_neon_01_7,"Not only did you accompany me to walk this path,"
m_ex_neon_01_8,but you've also taught me a lot of things.
m_ex_neon_01_9,It has been such a pleasure to meet you.
m_ex_neon_01_10,"In that case,"
m_ex_neon_01_11,I wanted to ask you something about the firepower theory.
m_ex_neon_01_12,"I would like to know,"
m_ex_neon_01_13,what does firepower mean to you?
m_ex_neon_01_14,It's the sparkle of life.
m_ex_neon_01_15,I have never thought about it.
m_ex_neon_01_16,"Even if it takes life to burn, it's still worth investing in."
m_ex_neon_01_17,Wonderful.
m_ex_neon_01_18,"You are truly worthy of the name, Master."
m_ex_neon_01_19,!!!
m_ex_neon_01_20,You're saying it's just like breathing.
m_ex_neon_01_21,I understand.
m_ex_neon_01_22,Let me ask you one more question.
m_ex_neon_01_23,What's the end of firepower for you?
m_ex_neon_01_24,I don't know.
m_ex_neon_01_25,Oh...
m_ex_neon_01_26,I see.
m_ex_neon_01_27,"You haven't reached that level yet, Master."
m_ex_neon_01_28,Let's find out together.
m_ex_neon_01_29,Uh...
m_ex_neon_01_30,"Okay, haha..."
m_ex_neon_01_31,Let's find out together.
m_ex_neon_01_32,Let's do this!
m_ex_neon_01_33,Yes!
m_ex_neon_02_1,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_02_2,"just to be safe, I'd like to ask you something."
m_ex_neon_02_3,You didn't tell anyone
m_ex_neon_02_4,"that I'm a spy, right?"
m_ex_neon_02_5,"No, I didn't."
m_ex_neon_02_6,Right?
m_ex_neon_02_7,But why does everyone I meet
m_ex_neon_02_8,ask me if the espionage is going well?
m_ex_neon_02_9,So I bet there must be a spy.
m_ex_neon_02_10,A spy who's spying on me!
m_ex_neon_02_11,Maybe...
m_ex_neon_02_12,there're spies spying on other spies!
m_ex_neon_02_13,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_02_14,I can't trust anyone now.
m_ex_neon_02_15,Because this world is filled with spies.
m_ex_neon_02_16,Who did you tell that you were a spy?
m_ex_neon_02_17,"Master, Rapi, Anis."
m_ex_neon_02_18,"Yuni, Mihara, Sugar, Milk, Frima..."
m_ex_neon_02_19,"Also,"
m_ex_neon_02_20,"Signal, Delta, Brid, Soline, and Diesel."
m_ex_neon_02_21,"Not long ago, I told Rupee, Yan, Dolla"
m_ex_neon_02_22,"Exia, and Novel."
m_ex_neon_02_23,So you have no clues?
m_ex_neon_02_24,Ahem.
m_ex_neon_02_25,I got it!
m_ex_neon_02_26,"For the 11th time, there are spies around them!!"
m_ex_neon_02_27,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_02_28,Let's go catch the spy!!!
m_ex_neon_02_29,I'm quite busy.
m_ex_neon_02_30,What's more urgent than finding the spy?
m_ex_neon_02_31,I'm studying more about firepower.
m_ex_neon_02_32,I see.
m_ex_neon_02_33,"If you're studying firepower, there's no way to go about it."
m_ex_neon_02_34,Then we'll catch the spy later.
m_ex_neon_02_35,Good luck with your study.
m_ex_neon_03_1,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_03_2,I wonder...
m_ex_neon_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_neon_03_4,Can we negotiate our salary?
m_ex_neon_03_5,Excuse me?
m_ex_neon_03_6,"To be honest, with our current salary,"
m_ex_neon_03_7,it's difficult even to afford limited edition casings.
m_ex_neon_03_8,I'll talk to Ingrid.
m_ex_neon_03_9,What? Wait a minute.
m_ex_neon_03_10,You're going straight to the boss? There aren't any middle stages?
m_ex_neon_03_11,Do you want me to talk to her for you?
m_ex_neon_03_12,I'd really appreciate it.
m_ex_neon_03_13,Tell her that I'm doing a good job
m_ex_neon_03_14,with all our tasks up on the surface.
m_ex_neon_03_15,"Oh yeah, and tell her my firepower has increased!"
m_ex_neon_03_16,Something tells me the salary is staying right where it is.
m_ex_neon_03_17,You'll be lucky if your salary isn't cut.
m_ex_neon_03_18,!!!
m_ex_neon_03_19,"What are you saying, Master?"
m_ex_neon_03_20,Just kidding.
m_ex_neon_03_21,You can't kid around about something that serious!
m_ex_neon_03_22,I'll put in a good word for you.
m_ex_neon_03_23,Awesome!
m_ex_neon_03_24,"Thanks for doing this, Master!"
m_ex_neon_03_25,No problem.
m_ex_noah_01_1,Wow.
m_ex_noah_01_2,"What's going on, Imposter? LMAO"
m_ex_noah_01_3,"I guess you've spent your lifetime supply of luck, huh?"
m_ex_noah_01_4,What do you mean?
m_ex_noah_01_5,Can't you see?
m_ex_noah_01_6,You and I are on the same team together now.
m_ex_noah_01_7,"With the help of the Strongest Shield on the surface,"
m_ex_noah_01_8,you have no need to worry. I got your back!
m_ex_noah_01_9,I see.
m_ex_noah_01_10,That's great.
m_ex_noah_01_11,"But, what should I do?"
m_ex_noah_01_12,I still have a really big concern.
m_ex_noah_01_13,A really big concern?
m_ex_noah_01_14,"You are too weak, Imposter."
m_ex_noah_01_15,I've never seen someone as weak as you on the surface.
m_ex_noah_01_16,And I can't help you with that.
m_ex_noah_01_17,Do you have any idea?
m_ex_noah_01_18,I'll become stronger in the future.
m_ex_noah_01_19,Hmm?
m_ex_noah_01_20,But can you really become half as strong as the real Commander?
m_ex_noah_01_21,or even one-fourth of his strength?
m_ex_noah_01_22,"... Take a deep breath, and tell myself to be patient."
m_ex_noah_01_23,"But sometimes,"
m_ex_noah_01_24,people with perseverance like you
m_ex_noah_01_25,may soon achieve whatever they want lol.
m_ex_noah_01_26,"So, I, as the strongest one who breaks the balance of this world,"
m_ex_noah_01_27,will personally take good care of you
m_ex_noah_01_28,and always keep an eye out for you.
m_ex_noah_01_29,"I really appreciate that, thx :)"
m_ex_noah_01_30,"Huh, you better know how lucky you are."
m_ex_noah_01_31,"Unlike you, Imposter, I'm quite busy."
m_ex_noah_01_32,"So, see ya!"
m_ex_noah_01_33,"... Remember that,"
m_ex_noah_01_34,I need to be patient.
m_ex_noah_02_1,Imposter.
m_ex_noah_02_2,Helllooooooo?
m_ex_noah_02_3,What's the matter?
m_ex_noah_02_4,Something really wild happened to me today.
m_ex_noah_02_5,Wanna hear about it?
m_ex_noah_02_6,Tell me.
m_ex_noah_02_7,"I'd been patrolling the base for 5 hours,"
m_ex_noah_02_8,just like you'd instructed.
m_ex_noah_02_9,Then there it was!
m_ex_noah_02_10,Right in front of me!
m_ex_noah_02_11,About 10 Nikkes and a Commander who looked completely out of it.
m_ex_noah_02_12,They were wandering around our turf.
m_ex_noah_02_13,"The only thing was, I didn't have any backup."
m_ex_noah_02_14,"I mean, it was 10 against 1, ya know?"
m_ex_noah_02_15,So it got me thinking as to
m_ex_noah_02_16,what I should do.
m_ex_noah_02_17,Was there any real danger?
m_ex_noah_02_18,Was communication not an option?
m_ex_noah_02_19,"Sure,"
m_ex_noah_02_20,"For them, but for not me."
m_ex_noah_02_21,Yep.
m_ex_noah_02_22,"I could have wiped the floor with them,"
m_ex_noah_02_23,"but they kept running their mouths, saying they'd bring me back to the Ark by force."
m_ex_noah_02_24,"I gave one of 'em a love tap with my shield,"
m_ex_noah_02_25,"then asked, ""Who's next?"""
m_ex_noah_02_26,The Commander looked like he nearly soiled his undies!
m_ex_noah_02_27,"I've never seen someone turn tail and run that fast, other than Isabel."
m_ex_noah_02_28,"On seeing this, those Nikkes also became afraid of me"
m_ex_noah_02_29,and sneaked away.
m_ex_noah_02_30,"Anyway, after I finished my patrol route,"
m_ex_noah_02_31,I started getting a little worried.
m_ex_noah_02_32,"I know I'm the best of the best,"
m_ex_noah_02_33,but can live on the surface
m_ex_noah_02_34,really be so easy?
m_ex_noah_02_35,You've trained hard to get to this point.
m_ex_noah_02_36,"Life, not live."
m_ex_noah_02_37,"Oh, hehe."
m_ex_noah_02_38,You're right about it.
m_ex_noah_02_39,You know how to handle yourself.
m_ex_noah_02_40,Hehehe
m_ex_noah_02_41,Why are you being so genuine all of a sudden?
m_ex_noah_02_42,Hehehe
m_ex_noah_02_43,What?
m_ex_noah_02_44,No way.
m_ex_noah_02_45,"It's live. Even I know that, and I'm a Nikke."
m_ex_noah_02_46,Why don't you look it up and get back to me?
m_ex_noah_02_47,... There is no reply for a while.
m_ex_noah_02_48,Fine.
m_ex_noah_02_49,You win this round.
m_ex_noah_02_50,"Anyway,"
m_ex_noah_02_51,that's not the main point.
m_ex_noah_02_52,I wanted to tell you something.
m_ex_noah_02_53,Tell them to steer clear of this area from now on.
m_ex_noah_02_54,"I scared them off this time, no harm done."
m_ex_noah_02_55,They may not be so lucky next time.
m_ex_noah_02_56,Understand?
m_ex_noah_02_57,I don't have that kind of authority.
m_ex_noah_02_58,I understand.
m_ex_noah_02_59,"That's your problem, not mine."
m_ex_noah_02_60,I've already given them a warning.
m_ex_noah_02_61,Good.
m_ex_noah_02_62,That's more like it.
m_ex_noah_02_63,"Well, it's only right that a big strong Nikke like myself"
m_ex_noah_02_64,"head back into the thick of it up on the surface, unlike you."
m_ex_noah_02_65,I'll be off.
m_ex_noah_02_66,Don't let me catch you slacking off.
m_ex_noah_02_67,Noah resumes her patrol.
m_ex_noah_03_1,Hypo
m_ex_noah_03_2,"Hey, Hypo!"
m_ex_noah_03_3,?
m_ex_noah_03_4,"It's short for Imposter, hehe!"
m_ex_noah_03_5,????
m_ex_noah_03_6,"What, nothing to say?"
m_ex_noah_03_7,Don't you know? Shortening words is the new thing.
m_ex_noah_03_8,"If you don't stay hip with the new lingo,"
m_ex_noah_03_9,you'll end up feeling like everyone around you is speaking gibberish.
m_ex_noah_03_10,"You'll grow old and bitter, then..."
m_ex_noah_03_11,Stop.
m_ex_noah_03_12,Cit. That means can it.
m_ex_noah_03_13,"Hehe, didn't get under your skin, did I?"
m_ex_noah_03_14,You're already falling behind times!
m_ex_noah_03_15,Can't you feel it?
m_ex_noah_03_16,?????????
m_ex_noah_03_17,BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
m_ex_noah_03_18,Who would abbreviate something like that?
m_ex_noah_03_19,"I'll give you an A for effort,"
m_ex_noah_03_20,but that... was just terrible. Hahaha!
m_ex_noah_03_21,... I need to stay calm.
m_ex_noah_03_22,"Hey, what's with the silent treatment?"
m_ex_noah_03_23,"You're not pissed off, are you?"
m_ex_noah_03_24,"C'mon, what is it?"
m_ex_noah_03_25,I was just finishing up some work.
m_ex_noah_03_26,I needed time to cool off.
m_ex_noah_03_27,I don't buy that for a second.
m_ex_noah_03_28,You're just making excuses because you're hot under the collar.
m_ex_noah_03_29,"As for me, I'm ACTUALLY busy, so I'll be going."
m_ex_noah_03_30,"Whoa, you were actually mad?"
m_ex_noah_03_31,Just calm down. No need to get upset.
m_ex_noah_03_32,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta run."
m_ex_noah_03_33,Bye bye.
m_ex_noah_03_34,... Life is not easy.
m_ex_novel_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_novel_01_2,"Looks like, we are gonna be, living under the same roof,"
m_ex_novel_01_3,"My name is,)@ Novel,,,"
m_ex_novel_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_novel_01_5,"As your future roommate, I feel I ought to, tell you about my shortcomings, in advance."
m_ex_novel_01_6,"I'm usually, up and about at night,"
m_ex_novel_01_7,"because I, need to investigate, crimes."
m_ex_novel_01_8,"Are, you, okay with, that,,,"
m_ex_novel_01_9,"I often work overtime, too."
m_ex_novel_01_10,"Also, for, some tricky cases,"
m_ex_novel_01_11,"to, try and bring out my, sleuthing skills,"
m_ex_novel_01_12,"I may act funny, for days, at a time."
m_ex_novel_01_13,"Stuff like doing somersaults, and bunny hops,,,"
m_ex_novel_01_14,That covers just about everything. What about you? Any shortcomings?
m_ex_novel_01_15,I'm extremely lazy.
m_ex_novel_01_16,I don't have a set sleep schedule.
m_ex_novel_01_17,!!
m_ex_novel_01_18,"This is, incredible."
m_ex_novel_01_19,"What you just said is, identical"
m_ex_novel_01_20,"to Watson,"
m_ex_novel_01_21,"the assistant to, the one and only Sherlock Holmes,,,"
m_ex_novel_01_22,"Would it, be all right if I"
m_ex_novel_01_23,"call you Watson, in the future?"
m_ex_novel_01_24,If you like.
m_ex_novel_01_25,Very well.
m_ex_novel_01_26,"Then, whenever I'm, out on a case, in the future,"
m_ex_novel_01_27,"I'll, be in touch,,,"
m_ex_novel_01_28,Do I have to?
m_ex_novel_01_29,Of course!
m_ex_novel_01_30,"Holmes wouldn't, have gone out, without Watson,"
m_ex_novel_01_31,"so I won't accept, anyone else, as my assistant."
m_ex_novel_01_32,I'm honored.
m_ex_novel_01_33,Sounds interesting.
m_ex_novel_01_34,Quite.
m_ex_novel_01_35,"It's just that, all the interesting, cases have dried up as of late."
m_ex_novel_01_36,"Hopefully, the bad guys, will put in a, bit more effort."
m_ex_novel_01_37,"I'm sure, they won't keep me, waiting much longer."
m_ex_novel_01_38,I look forward to it.
m_ex_novel_01_39,My new roommates seems very... interesting.
m_ex_novel_02_1,"Watson,"
m_ex_novel_02_2,"something terrible, has happened,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_novel_02_4,"I, touched, Exia's gaming console, today,"
m_ex_novel_02_5,"and her, game file, disappeared."
m_ex_novel_02_6,Does Exia know?
m_ex_novel_02_7,"No, not yet,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_8,Does it not show up on the main screen?
m_ex_novel_02_9,"No,"
m_ex_novel_02_10,"there's, nothing."
m_ex_novel_02_11,"If Exia finds out,"
m_ex_novel_02_12,"I'm done for,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_13,"Most, likely,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_14,"Why are you, imitating me,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_15,"Cause it, looks like fun,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_16,"This is, serious, Watson!"
m_ex_novel_02_17,Just download the game again.
m_ex_novel_02_18,Just pretend you know nothing about it.
m_ex_novel_02_19,"This is the first time, I've ever handled a game console,"
m_ex_novel_02_20,"I have no, idea how to download, games."
m_ex_novel_02_21,"But, I already, told Exia,"
m_ex_novel_02_22,"that I would use, her, game console,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_23,"Exia, is, coming back, soon,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_24,Steer clear of her.
m_ex_novel_02_25,"Watson,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_26,"Watson,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_27,What?
m_ex_novel_02_28,"I can hear, Exia's, foot, steps,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_29,"I just hid, the gaming console,,,"
m_ex_novel_02_30,Good job.
m_ex_novel_02_31,Wat...
m_ex_novel_02_32,??
m_ex_novel_02_33,Novel doesn't reply.
m_ex_novel_02_34,Novel??
m_ex_novel_02_35,"A long time passes, and still there are no further messages from Novel."
m_ex_novel_03_1,"Hello, Watson."
m_ex_novel_03_2,??
m_ex_novel_03_3,"Until now, I hadn't gotten any reply from Novel."
m_ex_novel_03_4,What are you up to?
m_ex_novel_03_5,Hope you're having a nice day.
m_ex_novel_03_6,Is this Novel?
m_ex_novel_03_7,"After a moment, no reply."
m_ex_novel_03_8,Yes.
m_ex_novel_03_9,I'm practicing my typing.
m_ex_novel_03_10,You took a while to reply.
m_ex_novel_03_11,I want to
m_ex_novel_03_12,send an entire sentence
m_ex_novel_03_13,without any typos.
m_ex_novel_03_14,That's why I took so long to reply.
m_ex_novel_03_15,This doesn't feel right. Just stick to your previous style.
m_ex_novel_03_16,"Okay, got it, Watson,"
m_ex_novel_03_17,"Ahhh, this feels, much better,"
m_ex_novel_03_18,Agreed.
m_ex_novel_03_19,"The lesson, I've learned today, is that"
m_ex_novel_03_20,"I shouldn't, force myself, to make any changes."
m_ex_novel_03_21,"Actually, I, felt, weird, too."
m_ex_novel_03_22,Why did you try to change your writing then?
m_ex_novel_03_23,"Several, Nikkes, said, that my messages are a pain to read,"
m_ex_novel_03_24,"so, I thought, maybe I should try, making a change."
m_ex_novel_03_25,I think your messages are just fine as they are.
m_ex_novel_03_26,"You, think so?"
m_ex_novel_03_27,There's no need to fix what isn't broken.
m_ex_novel_03_28,"Okay, got it, Watson,"
m_ex_novel_03_29,"but, I still, need to practice,,,"
m_ex_novel_03_30,"All right, practice with me an hour every day."
m_ex_novel_03_31,!!
m_ex_novel_03_32,"Could I, really, do that?"
m_ex_novel_03_33,"Okay, then, I'll come pay you a visit, tomorrow,,,"
m_ex_novel_03_34,"Thanks, Watson,,,"
m_ex_novel_03_35,Think nothing of it.
m_ex_pepper_01_1,"Hello, Commander!"
m_ex_pepper_01_2,My name is Pepper. It's my first day at the Outpost Hospital.
m_ex_pepper_01_3,It's an honor to work with you.
m_ex_pepper_01_4,Same here.
m_ex_pepper_01_5,"Great, hehe!"
m_ex_pepper_01_6,Commander...
m_ex_pepper_01_7,can you help me with something?
m_ex_pepper_01_8,Sure.
m_ex_pepper_01_9,"Before I came here,"
m_ex_pepper_01_10,I was told you were neglecting your health.
m_ex_pepper_01_11,Is that true?
m_ex_pepper_01_12,"If anything, I paid too much attention to it."
m_ex_pepper_01_13,"Well, I do overlook it a bit too much."
m_ex_pepper_01_14,Really?
m_ex_pepper_01_15,I'm glad to hear that it's the total opposite!
m_ex_pepper_01_16,Wonderful!
m_ex_pepper_01_17,"Well, from now on, I'll be available to help look after your health."
m_ex_pepper_01_18,"If you feel sick or exhausted,"
m_ex_pepper_01_19,"be sure to come to the Hospital,"
m_ex_pepper_01_20,okay?
m_ex_pepper_01_21,Your health is the most important!
m_ex_pepper_01_22,Got it.
m_ex_pepper_01_23,"All right, take it easy."
m_ex_pepper_01_24,Don't work too hard.
m_ex_pepper_01_25,Same to you!
m_ex_pepper_02_1,Commander?
m_ex_pepper_02_2,Are you busy now?
m_ex_pepper_02_3,No.
m_ex_pepper_02_4,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_pepper_02_5,"I, um... actually have a tiny issue... I'm not sure if you could call it a problem, but..."
m_ex_pepper_02_6,I was hoping I could discuss it with you.
m_ex_pepper_02_7,What is it?
m_ex_pepper_02_8,I see all kinds of cases
m_ex_pepper_02_9,"working in a hospital,"
m_ex_pepper_02_10,so nothing really shocks me anymore.
m_ex_pepper_02_11,But Mihara came to the hospital not too long ago
m_ex_pepper_02_12,and told us she wasn't feeling well.
m_ex_pepper_02_13,"So I gave her an injection in the arm,"
m_ex_pepper_02_14,and she...
m_ex_pepper_02_15,seemed...to enjoy it?
m_ex_pepper_02_16,Oh?
m_ex_pepper_02_17,"Not only that, she asked if I could give her another injection on her butt."
m_ex_pepper_02_18,I was so taken aback that I couldn't even answer her.
m_ex_pepper_02_19,That's just Mihara doing what Mihara does.
m_ex_pepper_02_20,Doing what she does?
m_ex_pepper_02_21,So she's just a patient like everybody else?
m_ex_pepper_02_22,Hmm...
m_ex_pepper_02_23,You're right!
m_ex_pepper_02_24,"There are all kinds of people in the world,"
m_ex_pepper_02_25,so there's no way I can understand every one of them right off the bat.
m_ex_pepper_02_26,I can't let this experience get me down!
m_ex_pepper_02_27,"That's the spirit. Next time you meet Mihara, just treat her nicer."
m_ex_pepper_02_28,I will!
m_ex_pepper_02_29,I'll try and be more understanding next time.
m_ex_pepper_02_30,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_pepper_02_31,Happy to help.
m_ex_pepper_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_pepper_03_2,how can I become a love master?
m_ex_pepper_03_3,Where'd that question come from?
m_ex_pepper_03_4,Well...
m_ex_pepper_03_5,a simple hand gesture can get someone's heart thumping.
m_ex_pepper_03_6,Just a single word on blabla
m_ex_pepper_03_7,can have millions in a frenzy
m_ex_pepper_03_8,yearning for the next message.
m_ex_pepper_03_9,It's just like magic!
m_ex_pepper_03_10,How can I
m_ex_pepper_03_11,learn these
m_ex_pepper_03_12,techniques?
m_ex_pepper_03_13,Superpowers.
m_ex_pepper_03_14,Try using a gun.
m_ex_pepper_03_15,Huh?
m_ex_pepper_03_16,Superpowers?
m_ex_pepper_03_17,What's that gotta do with love?
m_ex_pepper_03_18,Didn't you say you wanna control others with a hand gesture?
m_ex_pepper_03_19,Yes!
m_ex_pepper_03_20,That's right!
m_ex_pepper_03_21,Then superpowers are what you're looking for.
m_ex_pepper_03_22,What?
m_ex_pepper_03_23,Use a gun?
m_ex_pepper_03_24,What good is a gun in love?
m_ex_pepper_03_25,"Of course, you do."
m_ex_pepper_03_26,Why would I need that?
m_ex_pepper_03_27,"""Love me, or you get a slug in the gut"""
m_ex_pepper_03_28,No way!
m_ex_pepper_03_29,That's a crime!
m_ex_pepper_03_30,Wait a minute...
m_ex_pepper_03_31,you're messing with me!
m_ex_pepper_03_32,"If it's impossible, then just tell me."
m_ex_pepper_03_33,It's impossible.
m_ex_pepper_03_34,You didn't have to be so blunt...
m_ex_pepper_03_35,Why do you want to be a love master anyway?
m_ex_pepper_03_36,Because then you can...
m_ex_pepper_03_37,Um... I don't know!
m_ex_pepper_03_38,"Anyway, I have my reasons!"
m_ex_pepper_03_39,??
m_ex_pepper_03_40,"It's something you don't needa know, Commander!"
m_ex_pepper_03_41,Um...
m_ex_pepper_03_42,I'll go ask the others!
m_ex_pepper_03_43,???
m_ex_pepper_03_44,Pepper has stopped reading messages.
m_ex_pepper_03_45,She's probably asking someone else about it.
m_ex_poli_01_1,"Hi, Commander,"
m_ex_poli_01_2,my name is Poli!
m_ex_poli_01_3,Nice to finally meet you
m_ex_poli_01_4,and pleased to be working with you.
m_ex_poli_01_5,Same here.
m_ex_poli_01_6,Hehe!
m_ex_poli_01_7,"So, what do you do?"
m_ex_poli_01_8,I'm a police officer who is
m_ex_poli_01_9,in charge of keeping
m_ex_poli_01_10,all citizens in the Ark safe!
m_ex_poli_01_11,What an important role!
m_ex_poli_01_12,"If you're ever in a tough spot,"
m_ex_poli_01_13,"don't hesitate to throw me a line,"
m_ex_poli_01_14,and I'll be there as soon as possible.
m_ex_poli_01_15,Don't forget that!
m_ex_poli_01_16,I won't forget that!
m_ex_poli_01_17,??!
m_ex_poli_01_18,"What do you think you're doing, Commander?"
m_ex_poli_01_19,Are you imitating me?
m_ex_poli_01_20,"Yes, I'm imitating you."
m_ex_poli_01_21,Hey!
m_ex_poli_01_22,What's the big idea?!
m_ex_poli_01_23,Grrrrr...
m_ex_poli_01_24,"Sorry. You're just too cute, so I couldn't resist."
m_ex_poli_01_25,That's no way to describe a police officer!
m_ex_poli_01_26,"I'd prefer people think I'm cool, not cute."
m_ex_poli_01_27,"All right, you're the coolest police officer around."
m_ex_poli_01_28,"Pssh, that doesn't count! I practically forced you to say it."
m_ex_poli_01_29,"Anyway, I'll let you off this time."
m_ex_poli_01_30,Thanks.
m_ex_poli_01_31,You're welcome.
m_ex_poli_01_32,I gotta go.
m_ex_poli_01_33,Where to?
m_ex_poli_01_34,Miranda is causing trouble again.
m_ex_poli_01_35,I gotta go pick up the pieces.
m_ex_poli_01_36,Sounds like fun.
m_ex_poli_01_37,Hehe.
m_ex_poli_01_38,"Catch you later, Commander."
m_ex_poli_01_39,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_poli_02_1,Commander.
m_ex_poli_02_2,What's up?
m_ex_poli_02_3,Are you looking for something?
m_ex_poli_02_4,I am!
m_ex_poli_02_5,Nope.
m_ex_poli_02_6,Ah hah!
m_ex_poli_02_7,Then this must be yours.
m_ex_poli_02_8,Huh? You're not?
m_ex_poli_02_9,That can't be.
m_ex_poli_02_10,Did you find something?
m_ex_poli_02_11,Sure did.
m_ex_poli_02_12,The police station received a lost item about a week ago.
m_ex_poli_02_13,No one has claimed it yet.
m_ex_poli_02_14,"I planned on looking for the owner by myself, so I gave it a whiff."
m_ex_poli_02_15,"Turns out, it smells just like you."
m_ex_poli_02_16,So I figured I'd ask you about it.
m_ex_poli_02_17,Your nose would put a bloodhound to shame.
m_ex_poli_02_18,"Hehe, you're too kind!"
m_ex_poli_02_19,"So, what exactly is this mystery item?"
m_ex_poli_02_20,It's a box.
m_ex_poli_02_21,"I don't feel right about opening it,"
m_ex_poli_02_22,so I've just been keeping it safe.
m_ex_poli_02_23,A box?
m_ex_poli_02_24,"Yes, it is."
m_ex_poli_02_25,Small and light?
m_ex_poli_02_26,Exactly.
m_ex_poli_02_27,Is it yours after all?!
m_ex_poli_02_28,Sounds like it may be my parcel.
m_ex_poli_02_29,But there's no tracking number on it...
m_ex_poli_02_30,I think I forgot to write that down when I sent it out.
m_ex_poli_02_31,No wonder!
m_ex_poli_02_32,"No sender, no recipient..."
m_ex_poli_02_33,that explains why it got sent to the Police Station.
m_ex_poli_02_34,"Hehe! Well, I'll have it returned to you."
m_ex_poli_02_35,Please pay more attention from now on!
m_ex_poli_02_36,Thank you.
m_ex_poli_02_37,... I should double-check these things when I send a parcel in the future.
m_ex_poli_03_1,"Hi,"
m_ex_poli_03_2,Commander!
m_ex_poli_03_3,"Wonderful day, isn't it?"
m_ex_poli_03_4,Very much so.
m_ex_poli_03_5,"Yep, sure is."
m_ex_poli_03_6,"There've been a few accidents here and there,"
m_ex_poli_03_7,but it's been nice and quiet
m_ex_poli_03_8,at the Outpost overall.
m_ex_poli_03_9,Couldn't agree more.
m_ex_poli_03_10,"Actually, it's a little too peaceful if you ask me."
m_ex_poli_03_11,"As a police officer,"
m_ex_poli_03_12,it's my duty to look after the citizens here.
m_ex_poli_03_13,"I feel lucky, but a little worried"
m_ex_poli_03_14,that I don't have anything to do.
m_ex_poli_03_15,What are you talking about?
m_ex_poli_03_16,Huh?
m_ex_poli_03_17,You're the reason the Outpost is as peaceful as it is.
m_ex_poli_03_18,"Hehe, I promise I wasn't fishing for a compliment,"
m_ex_poli_03_19,but thank you for saying that.
m_ex_poli_03_20,Hmm? Wait a minute.
m_ex_poli_03_21,"Poli leaves for a while, then comes back."
m_ex_poli_03_22,I'm back. I received a phone call saying that there had been a network issue.
m_ex_poli_03_23,I sent Exia to go solve it.
m_ex_poli_03_24,You all really do work hard.
m_ex_poli_03_25,I wouldn't go that far...
m_ex_poli_03_26,"Well, it's about time I go over"
m_ex_poli_03_27,the complaints we've received from the public.
m_ex_poli_03_28,"Oh shoot, I haven't read Miranda's report yet!"
m_ex_poli_03_29,Eek!
m_ex_poli_03_30,"What would we do without you, Poli?"
m_ex_poli_03_31,"Haha, you compliment me too much!"
m_ex_poli_03_32,"Honestly, you've done so much for the Outpost."
m_ex_poli_03_33,Um...
m_ex_poli_03_34,"Well, I can't deny it."
m_ex_poli_03_35,"After all, the best feeling a police officer can have is when"
m_ex_poli_03_36,their district is nice and safe.
m_ex_poli_03_37,My thoughts exactly.
m_ex_poli_03_38,You really make me feel good about myself.
m_ex_poli_03_39,Thank you for that.
m_ex_poli_03_40,"Sure, but you never ask how I'm doing..."
m_ex_poli_03_41,Huh?
m_ex_poli_03_42,I know you. You're pulling my leg right now! Way to spoil the mood...
m_ex_poli_03_43,Grrrrr!
m_ex_poli_03_44,"Sorry, couldn't resist! Haha"
m_ex_poli_03_45,Hmph!
m_ex_poli_03_46,I gotta go back to work.
m_ex_poli_03_47,Don't work too hard.
m_ex_privaty_01_1,Hmm!
m_ex_privaty_01_2,I don't feel like replying right now.
m_ex_privaty_01_3,Hmmm!
m_ex_privaty_01_4,I want to play a trick on her a bit more.
m_ex_privaty_01_5,Hmm?
m_ex_privaty_01_6,???
m_ex_privaty_01_7,Commander?
m_ex_privaty_01_8,What are you doing?
m_ex_privaty_01_9,I can see that you've read my messages.
m_ex_privaty_01_10,Why aren't you replying?
m_ex_privaty_01_11,Hmm.
m_ex_privaty_01_12,Too late!
m_ex_privaty_01_13,What's the matter?
m_ex_privaty_01_14,Save it! I don't want to talk to you.
m_ex_privaty_01_15,Okay.
m_ex_privaty_01_16,Huh?
m_ex_privaty_01_17,You said you would not talk to me?
m_ex_privaty_01_18,Um.
m_ex_privaty_01_19,"When having done something wrong,"
m_ex_privaty_01_20,"even a child knows to say sorry, right?"
m_ex_privaty_01_21,No.
m_ex_privaty_01_22,What?
m_ex_privaty_01_23,What do you mean?
m_ex_privaty_01_24,"Ugh, Commander!"
m_ex_privaty_01_25,I'm sorry.
m_ex_privaty_01_26,What?
m_ex_privaty_01_27,Will you come up here today?
m_ex_privaty_01_28,Um... well...
m_ex_privaty_01_29,I know you're texting me about that.
m_ex_privaty_01_30,That's right.
m_ex_privaty_01_31,... Seems that you are ignoring what you did.
m_ex_privaty_01_32,But yes.
m_ex_privaty_01_33,I was contacted to be up in the Outpost.
m_ex_privaty_01_34,That's why I sent a message to you.
m_ex_privaty_01_35,"Hmm! So if that's the case,"
m_ex_privaty_01_36,let's get along well.
m_ex_privaty_01_37,"If you get in trouble on missions, it's OK to ask me for help, you know?"
m_ex_privaty_01_38,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_privaty_01_39,"Well, in that case..."
m_ex_privaty_01_40,I'm also
m_ex_privaty_01_41,looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_privaty_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_privaty_02_2,have you heard about the new Dessert Cafe
m_ex_privaty_02_3,on Royal Road?
m_ex_privaty_02_4,"No, this is the first time I've heard that.​"
m_ex_privaty_02_5,What? Everyone knows that place!
m_ex_privaty_02_6,"Oh, right, yeah. Of course."
m_ex_privaty_02_7,You live out there in the sticks.
m_ex_privaty_02_8,It's no wonder you have no clue what's going on in the outside world.
m_ex_privaty_02_9,So what exactly is this place?
m_ex_privaty_02_10,Don't freak out.
m_ex_privaty_02_11,The desserts there
m_ex_privaty_02_12,taste like real fruit!
m_ex_privaty_02_13,That must be expensive.
m_ex_privaty_02_14,Nope!
m_ex_privaty_02_15,"Although they taste like real fruit,"
m_ex_privaty_02_16,they are actually 100% Splendamin!
m_ex_privaty_02_17,Isn't that a scam?
m_ex_privaty_02_18,What?
m_ex_privaty_02_19,You can't say that about these perfect desserts!
m_ex_privaty_02_20,"Okay, I see."
m_ex_privaty_02_21,Uh-huh!
m_ex_privaty_02_22,"Jeez, you're losing all your compassion"
m_ex_privaty_02_23,rotting away in that far-flung rathole.
m_ex_privaty_02_24,Thanks for the tip.
m_ex_privaty_02_25,"Sure,"
m_ex_privaty_02_26,don't worry about it.
m_ex_privaty_02_27,Okay.
m_ex_privaty_02_28,There is silence for a while.
m_ex_privaty_02_29,Mmm?
m_ex_privaty_02_30,Is that all you've got to say?
m_ex_privaty_02_31,Yeah?
m_ex_privaty_02_32,You're unbelievable!
m_ex_privaty_02_33,"When someone tells you about a place like this,"
m_ex_privaty_02_34,the natural response
m_ex_privaty_02_35,is to invite them
m_ex_privaty_02_36,to go with you!
m_ex_privaty_02_37,Then would you like to go together?
m_ex_privaty_02_38,It's too late to ask me now!
m_ex_privaty_02_39,Guess I'll just have to go with someone else.
m_ex_privaty_02_40,!!!
m_ex_privaty_02_41,"Oh no, you don't!"
m_ex_privaty_02_42,I'm the one who told you!
m_ex_privaty_02_43,"I refuse once,"
m_ex_privaty_02_44,and you decide to invite someone else.
m_ex_privaty_02_45,Incredible.
m_ex_privaty_02_46,"You're way out of line, Commander!"
m_ex_privaty_02_47,Sorry.
m_ex_privaty_02_48,You better be
m_ex_privaty_02_49,super duper sorry!
m_ex_privaty_02_50,"Grrrr, I can barely type anymore!"
m_ex_privaty_02_51,I'm so annoyed!
m_ex_privaty_02_52,Let's go together.
m_ex_privaty_02_53,You're just saying this now?
m_ex_privaty_02_54,"If I go like this, I'll be throwing my pride out the window!"
m_ex_privaty_02_55,"No way, sir!"
m_ex_privaty_02_56,In that case...
m_ex_privaty_02_57,"I swear, if you say you're gonna go with someone else"
m_ex_privaty_02_58,"because I turned you down,"
m_ex_privaty_02_59,I'm gonna lose it!
m_ex_privaty_02_60,I'm going to go with you.
m_ex_privaty_02_61,Hmph!
m_ex_privaty_02_62,Honest.
m_ex_privaty_02_63,Double hmph!
m_ex_privaty_02_64,Then I won't go either.
m_ex_privaty_02_65,I don't want to go with anyone else.
m_ex_privaty_02_66,!!
m_ex_privaty_02_67,You're telling me you really won't go
m_ex_privaty_02_68,without me?
m_ex_privaty_02_69,Really?
m_ex_privaty_02_70,You really won't go with anyone else but me?
m_ex_privaty_02_71,That's right.
m_ex_privaty_02_72,No messages came in for a while.
m_ex_privaty_02_73,Sigh...
m_ex_privaty_02_74,I guess I have no choice.
m_ex_privaty_02_75,I'll go with you.
m_ex_privaty_02_76,"I've reserved seats for tomorrow, so"
m_ex_privaty_02_77,meet me downtown in the Ark.
m_ex_privaty_02_78,Don't be late!
m_ex_privaty_02_79,Got it?
m_ex_privaty_02_80,Got it.
m_ex_privaty_03_1,Um...
m_ex_privaty_03_2,Commander.
m_ex_privaty_03_3,I'm a nervous wreck.
m_ex_privaty_03_4,Can you talk for a minute and calm me down?
m_ex_privaty_03_5,What's the matter?
m_ex_privaty_03_6,Well...
m_ex_privaty_03_7,I'm going to be reporting to Deputy Chief Andersen
m_ex_privaty_03_8,regarding the crackdown on protests in the Ark.
m_ex_privaty_03_9,He's just a bit...
m_ex_privaty_03_10,a bit...
m_ex_privaty_03_11,you know what I mean?
m_ex_privaty_03_12,"No, I don't."
m_ex_privaty_03_13,How can you not know?
m_ex_privaty_03_14,You work directly under him!
m_ex_privaty_03_15,"Bah, you're impossible to talk to!"
m_ex_privaty_03_16,"All right, conversation over then."
m_ex_privaty_03_17,"Hey, c'mon! There's no need to go overboard."
m_ex_privaty_03_18,What I wanted to say was
m_ex_privaty_03_19,that he's not easy to deal with.
m_ex_privaty_03_20,"Typically,"
m_ex_privaty_03_21,"whenever I'm reporting to my other superiors,"
m_ex_privaty_03_22,they'll let me off if I've made a small mistake.
m_ex_privaty_03_23,But Deputy Chief Andersen...
m_ex_privaty_03_24,He doesn't let anything slide.
m_ex_privaty_03_25,He's strictly by the book.
m_ex_privaty_03_26,Right!
m_ex_privaty_03_27,Exactly!
m_ex_privaty_03_28,"So if I don't follow everything to the letter,"
m_ex_privaty_03_29,he'll have this sour look on his face.
m_ex_privaty_03_30,Gulp...
m_ex_privaty_03_31,Just imagining it makes me nervous.
m_ex_privaty_03_32,You don't have to be so nervous.
m_ex_privaty_03_33,What?
m_ex_privaty_03_34,"So long as his subordinates make an effort, he won't criticize them unduly."
m_ex_privaty_03_35,I can't see you making any major mistakes.
m_ex_privaty_03_36,Are you sure?
m_ex_privaty_03_37,But how would you...
m_ex_privaty_03_38,Hmmm...
m_ex_privaty_03_39,"That's true,"
m_ex_privaty_03_40,but...
m_ex_privaty_03_41,Eek!
m_ex_privaty_03_42,His secretary just called me!
m_ex_privaty_03_43,I'll talk to you later
m_ex_privaty_03_44,and...
m_ex_privaty_03_45,thank you
m_ex_privaty_03_46,for putting my mind at ease.
m_ex_rapi_01_1,Commander.
m_ex_rapi_01_2,May I have some of your time?
m_ex_rapi_01_3,Sure.
m_ex_rapi_01_4,I just came to this realization and it seems like I haven't officially introduced myself to you yet.
m_ex_rapi_01_5,My name is Rapi.
m_ex_rapi_01_6,I look forward to working with you.
m_ex_rapi_01_7,Likewise.
m_ex_rapi_01_8,Okay.
m_ex_rapi_01_9,"Excuse me, may I ask you a question?"
m_ex_rapi_01_10,"Sure, go ahead."
m_ex_rapi_01_11,Why did you hesitate
m_ex_rapi_01_12,when you disposed of Marian?
m_ex_rapi_01_13,Anyone who's in that situation will hesitate as well.
m_ex_rapi_01_14,That situation?
m_ex_rapi_01_15,A situation where someone is going to lose their life.
m_ex_rapi_01_16,"Usually, people don't hesitate."
m_ex_rapi_01_17,It's quite usual for a Nikke to lose her life.
m_ex_rapi_01_18,"Well, it's not usual for me."
m_ex_rapi_01_19,Really?
m_ex_rapi_01_20,I see.
m_ex_rapi_01_21,Sorry for bringing up such an offensive question.
m_ex_rapi_01_22,I'll go be on standby then.
m_ex_rapi_01_23,How about you?
m_ex_rapi_01_24,What?
m_ex_rapi_01_25,What was going through your mind when you were looking at Marian?
m_ex_rapi_01_26,Nothing in particular.
m_ex_rapi_01_27,"No, I mean... Sorry."
m_ex_rapi_01_28,I felt a bit sad.
m_ex_rapi_01_29,Did you?
m_ex_rapi_01_30,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_01_31,I'll go back to being on standby then.
m_ex_rapi_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_rapi_02_2,I have a question.
m_ex_rapi_02_3,"If you could install something new in your office,"
m_ex_rapi_02_4,what would it be?
m_ex_rapi_02_5,A bigger fridge.
m_ex_rapi_02_6,A better computer.
m_ex_rapi_02_7,A bigger fridge?
m_ex_rapi_02_8,Why's that?
m_ex_rapi_02_9,The one you have now is already pretty hefty.
m_ex_rapi_02_10,It's occupied by Anis' sodas.
m_ex_rapi_02_11,"Ah, got it."
m_ex_rapi_02_12,I'll be sure to speak with Anis.
m_ex_rapi_02_13,A better computer?
m_ex_rapi_02_14,"As far as I know, I've not encountered any issues"
m_ex_rapi_02_15,when I file your paperwork.
m_ex_rapi_02_16,Have you experienced any issues with your computer?
m_ex_rapi_02_17,Exia wants an upgrade so that she can play some higher-end games.
m_ex_rapi_02_18,Ah.
m_ex_rapi_02_19,So that's it.
m_ex_rapi_02_20,I'll be sure to speak with Exia.
m_ex_rapi_02_21,"No, don't worry about it."
m_ex_rapi_02_22,"Putting the Nikkes aside,"
m_ex_rapi_02_23,isn't there something you'd like for yourself?
m_ex_rapi_02_24,"No, not really."
m_ex_rapi_02_25,Very well.
m_ex_rapi_02_26,If you insist.
m_ex_rapi_02_27,I guess that's that.
m_ex_rapi_02_28,What makes you ask?
m_ex_rapi_02_29,"You're always doing things for us,"
m_ex_rapi_02_30,so I thought this time we could allot a portion of the budget
m_ex_rapi_02_31,to purchase something that you yourself wanted.
m_ex_rapi_02_32,"However, since you don't seem to require anything, I suppose there's no need to do so."
m_ex_rapi_02_33,"No, wait. Actually, there may be something."
m_ex_rapi_02_34,"I'm sorry, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_02_35,It's too late now.
m_ex_rapi_02_36,I just uploaded the budget sheets.
m_ex_rapi_02_37,Oh...
m_ex_rapi_02_38,I'll ask again when I make the budget for the next quarter.
m_ex_rapi_02_39,Be sure to speak up then.
m_ex_rapi_02_40,Okay.
m_ex_rapi_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_rapi_03_2,do you have a moment?
m_ex_rapi_03_3,"Yes, I do."
m_ex_rapi_03_4,I heard that you've been having trouble sleeping.
m_ex_rapi_03_5,Is there something that is concerning you?
m_ex_rapi_03_6,I've been binge watching a lot of TV series.
m_ex_rapi_03_7,It's because this new game just released.
m_ex_rapi_03_8,"Yes, I believe Signa told me you and her"
m_ex_rapi_03_9,are doing something like that.
m_ex_rapi_03_10,"Yes, I believe Maiden told me"
m_ex_rapi_03_11,you two recently joined the same guild.
m_ex_rapi_03_12,"If that's the case, I'm glad."
m_ex_rapi_03_13,I thought it might have been something
m_ex_rapi_03_14,that you weren't able to tell us.
m_ex_rapi_03_15,I was worried.
m_ex_rapi_03_16,Thank you for your concern.
m_ex_rapi_03_17,"Commander,"
m_ex_rapi_03_18,"if there is anything weighing heavy on your mind,"
m_ex_rapi_03_19,"you would share it with us, wouldn't you?"
m_ex_rapi_03_20,I don't want to put any more of burden on any of you.
m_ex_rapi_03_21,Commander.
m_ex_rapi_03_22,We're on your side.
m_ex_rapi_03_23,More than you might think.
m_ex_rapi_03_24,I can't guarantee how much help we'll be...
m_ex_rapi_03_25,But I believe we're stronger together than apart.
m_ex_rapi_03_26,I think it's better to put our minds together to solve any problems we're up against.
m_ex_rapi_03_27,I'll do that next time.
m_ex_rapi_03_28,"Of course, I'm not saying you have to tell us everything."
m_ex_rapi_03_29,Just know that we are always by your side.
m_ex_rapi_03_30,Okay.
m_ex_rapi_03_31,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_03_32,Get some rest.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_1,"Sorry for the late reply,"
m_ex_rapunzel_01_2,but I've only managed to get a signal.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_3,Did you call me earlier?
m_ex_rapunzel_01_4,Sure did.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_5,Oh my goodness!
m_ex_rapunzel_01_6,I didn't expect that you would
m_ex_rapunzel_01_7,call me on the sly like that.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_8,"You must be thinking about all sorts of things to do to me when we're alone together, haha."
m_ex_rapunzel_01_9,It just so happens I do need your help with something.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_10,"Ah,"
m_ex_rapunzel_01_11,I see!
m_ex_rapunzel_01_12,"Well,"
m_ex_rapunzel_01_13,I have to stay on the surface
m_ex_rapunzel_01_14,to attend to some matters.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_15,You don't say...
m_ex_rapunzel_01_16,"Don't worry, I'm not declining your request entirely."
m_ex_rapunzel_01_17,"If you ever need me when you're on the surface,"
m_ex_rapunzel_01_18,you'll be safe with me.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_19,Stay in touch.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_20,Thank you.
m_ex_rapunzel_01_21,May the blessing of God be upon you.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_1,"Believer,"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_2,are you busy?
m_ex_rapunzel_02_3,I'm having a little siesta.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_4,Sounds nice.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_5,"When I was wandering on the surface,"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_6,I found something quite interesting.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_7,Wanna guess what it was?
m_ex_rapunzel_02_8,Give me a hint.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_9,"It's long and hard,"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_10,and rounded on one wooden end.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_11,"There's some white remnants on the end,"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_12,and some bristles as well.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_13,"Hehe, take a guess!"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_14,A toothbrush.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_15,Um...
m_ex_rapunzel_02_16,Aw c'mon!
m_ex_rapunzel_02_17,It's no fun if you get it right that quickly!
m_ex_rapunzel_02_18,"Well, what else can it be? Hehehe!"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_19,"I know what you're thinking,"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_20,so go for it!
m_ex_rapunzel_02_21,A toothbrush?
m_ex_rapunzel_02_22,Wow.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_23,"Haha, bingo!"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_24,"I found a joke book, and it was"
m_ex_rapunzel_02_25,a nice way to pass the time while on the road.
m_ex_rapunzel_02_26,"If you're curious, I can lend it to you."
m_ex_rapunzel_02_27,"Sure, I'd love to flip through it."
m_ex_rapunzel_02_28,"Haha, all right."
m_ex_rapunzel_02_29,May the blessing of God be upon you this day.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_1,Today is yet another
m_ex_rapunzel_03_2,"blessed day,"
m_ex_rapunzel_03_3,because I prayed for you.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_4,But there are always these... impure thoughts...
m_ex_rapunzel_03_5,"Um... never mind that! Just my mind playing tricks on me, hehe."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_6,I thought sending you a message
m_ex_rapunzel_03_7,might help put my mind at ease.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_8,Anything I can do for you?
m_ex_rapunzel_03_9,Hmmm...
m_ex_rapunzel_03_10,Free my mind of these indecent thoughts.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_11,So why don't you tell me about your day?
m_ex_rapunzel_03_12,"For example, when you got up this morning,"
m_ex_rapunzel_03_13,did you stop to ponder what your condition was?
m_ex_rapunzel_03_14,Have you relieved yourself of it? Hehehe!
m_ex_rapunzel_03_15,"Somehow, I don't think that'll help much."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_16,"Hehe, I suppose you're right. Sorry about that."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_17,"But honestly, talking with you is much better"
m_ex_rapunzel_03_18,than letting my own imagination run wild.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_19,"You know what? When I was praying this morning,"
m_ex_rapunzel_03_20,I envisioned you having me up against a wall
m_ex_rapunzel_03_21,"to the point where I can hardly move. Well, it's not like I wish to anyway..."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_22,I think talking to me is only going to make things worse.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_23,Yeah...
m_ex_rapunzel_03_24,"Actually,"
m_ex_rapunzel_03_25,another solution would be to wander on the surface
m_ex_rapunzel_03_26,and focus on saving as many Nikkes as possible.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_27,"Nevertheless, indulging in my fantasies with you..."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_28,"Um... I mean, chatting with you like this makes me happy. Haha."
m_ex_rapunzel_03_29,Gotta go back to work.
m_ex_rapunzel_03_30,May the blessing of God be upon you always.
m_ex_rupee_01_1,Helloooo! :D
m_ex_rupee_01_2,Is this Sweetie?
m_ex_rupee_01_3,Yes.
m_ex_rupee_01_4,Aaaahhh!
m_ex_rupee_01_5,It's actually you!
m_ex_rupee_01_6,I'm so excited my chip is gonna fall out!
m_ex_rupee_01_7,That's not even possible.
m_ex_rupee_01_8,So am I.
m_ex_rupee_01_9,Huh?
m_ex_rupee_01_10,"Well, yeah! Duh!"
m_ex_rupee_01_11,Nikkes don't have citizenship chips.
m_ex_rupee_01_12,"How can we drop something we don't even have, you silly billy? ;P"
m_ex_rupee_01_13,Sorry.
m_ex_rupee_01_14,Um...
m_ex_rupee_01_15,I didn't mean to be so serious.
m_ex_rupee_01_16,Sorry... hehe!
m_ex_rupee_01_17,Ever since my boss showed me
m_ex_rupee_01_18,"your photo, I've been dying to meet you!"
m_ex_rupee_01_19,I haven't gotten a wink of sleep!
m_ex_rupee_01_20,See? T^T
m_ex_rupee_01_21,Just look at the dark circles under my eyes.
m_ex_rupee_01_22,But... I can't see anything...
m_ex_rupee_01_23,"Hehe, seems my makeup is doing its job! :3"
m_ex_rupee_01_24,"Anyway,"
m_ex_rupee_01_25,I just wanted to say hi!
m_ex_rupee_01_26,Allow me to introduce myself.
m_ex_rupee_01_27,"As you've probably already noticed from my screen name,"
m_ex_rupee_01_28,I'm Rupee.
m_ex_rupee_01_29,"I'm from Talentum, a squad composed of businesswomen."
m_ex_rupee_01_30,"I also run Rushae, a shopping mall"
m_ex_rupee_01_31,"with luxury brands,"
m_ex_rupee_01_32,"luxury brands,"
m_ex_rupee_01_33,and more luxury brands...
m_ex_rupee_01_34,Just tell me if there's anything you want!
m_ex_rupee_01_35,"I'll give you all we have in stock, hehe!"
m_ex_rupee_01_36,"That's okay, thanks."
m_ex_rupee_01_37,"I appreciate it, but no thanks."
m_ex_rupee_01_38,My goodness!
m_ex_rupee_01_39,Are you for real? T^T
m_ex_rupee_01_40,You're not interested in branded goods? O.O
m_ex_rupee_01_41,Commanders can't accept any expensive gifts.
m_ex_rupee_01_42,I see T^T
m_ex_rupee_01_43,Hmm...
m_ex_rupee_01_44,How about this?
m_ex_rupee_01_45,"When you have time, you can go shopping"
m_ex_rupee_01_46,with me at Royal Road.
m_ex_rupee_01_47,I can buy you something as a thank you gift.
m_ex_rupee_01_48,Doesn't that sound nice?
m_ex_rupee_01_49,So you enjoy shopping?
m_ex_rupee_01_50,Wouldn't you have more fun shopping with your friends?
m_ex_rupee_01_51,That's the understatement of the century!
m_ex_rupee_01_52,Shopping is my favorite
m_ex_rupee_01_53,thing in the entire world.
m_ex_rupee_01_54,I love shopping so much
m_ex_rupee_01_55,that I created my own shopping mall.
m_ex_rupee_01_56,"Pffft, as if!"
m_ex_rupee_01_57,My friends are so stingy that they're only interested in selling things.
m_ex_rupee_01_58,They never buy anything T^T
m_ex_rupee_01_59,I can't ever get them to go shopping with me.
m_ex_rupee_01_60,"All right, then I'll go shopping with you sometime."
m_ex_rupee_01_61,Gasp!
m_ex_rupee_01_62,Seriously!?
m_ex_rupee_01_63,Yaaaayyyyy!!
m_ex_rupee_01_64,I think this is
m_ex_rupee_01_65,the beginning of a
m_ex_rupee_01_66,beautiful relationship :3
m_ex_rupee_01_67,Ditto!
m_ex_rupee_01_68,Glad you feel that way too ;)
m_ex_rupee_01_69,Hehehe!
m_ex_rupee_01_70,We'll be in touch!!
m_ex_rupee_01_71,"Nobody in the entire Ark can compare to you, Sweetie ♡"
m_ex_rupee_02_1,"Sweetie, Sweetie!"
m_ex_rupee_02_2,How have you been?
m_ex_rupee_02_3,"Not too busy, I hope."
m_ex_rupee_02_4,Please don't be busy T^T
m_ex_rupee_02_5,What's up?
m_ex_rupee_02_6,I'm gonna be live streaming a pool party
m_ex_rupee_02_7,a few days from now.
m_ex_rupee_02_8,"It's going to be at a hotel, and it's for couples,"
m_ex_rupee_02_9,so I was planning on taking you with me!
m_ex_rupee_02_10,What do you think? ;)
m_ex_rupee_02_11,Is that okay?
m_ex_rupee_02_12,I don't have anything to swim in.
m_ex_rupee_02_13,I can't swim.
m_ex_rupee_02_14,You don't have to worry about that!
m_ex_rupee_02_15,I've already prepared
m_ex_rupee_02_16,ten matching swimsuits for us :3
m_ex_rupee_02_17,You don't have to worry about that!
m_ex_rupee_02_18,We'll just be there to have our photos taken
m_ex_rupee_02_19,and see what swimsuit brands other people are wearing.
m_ex_rupee_02_20,"All in all, we don't have to swim ;P"
m_ex_rupee_02_21,Will that be all right?
m_ex_rupee_02_22,I don't think I have time.
m_ex_rupee_02_23,"Awwwww, whyyyy?! T^T"
m_ex_rupee_02_24,TT^TT
m_ex_rupee_02_25,C'mmooon.
m_ex_rupee_02_26,Are you really gonna be that busy?
m_ex_rupee_02_27,I was only joking.
m_ex_rupee_02_28,"Hey, you scared me there for a sec!"
m_ex_rupee_02_29,So can you come?
m_ex_rupee_02_30,Yep.
m_ex_rupee_02_31,Woohoo!!! ♡♡♡♡
m_ex_rupee_02_32,I'll send you all the details later.
m_ex_rupee_02_33,Thanks a bunch!
m_ex_rupee_03_1,Sweetieeee T^T
m_ex_rupee_03_2,Something really got me upset.
m_ex_rupee_03_3,Can I talk to you about it?
m_ex_rupee_03_4,What happened?
m_ex_rupee_03_5,"Someone, who claimed to be a fan of mine, had recently sent me a gift."
m_ex_rupee_03_6,"When I opened it, it turned out to be a"
m_ex_rupee_03_7,super expensive necklace!
m_ex_rupee_03_8,Wow.
m_ex_rupee_03_9,"As much as I love luxury brands,"
m_ex_rupee_03_10,I don't feel right accepting such an expensive gift
m_ex_rupee_03_11,from a total stranger.
m_ex_rupee_03_12,What do you think? :/
m_ex_rupee_03_13,"If it were me, I'd feel bad."
m_ex_rupee_03_14,"Exactly, so it took me a couple of days"
m_ex_rupee_03_15,to search for this sender!
m_ex_rupee_03_16,"Eventually, I was able to return it to him."
m_ex_rupee_03_17,And then?
m_ex_rupee_03_18,"When I approached him,"
m_ex_rupee_03_19,he told me the necklace
m_ex_rupee_03_20,was a fake!
m_ex_rupee_03_21,"Even now, the thought of it infuriates me!"
m_ex_rupee_03_22,"I've pretty much wasted all my time,"
m_ex_rupee_03_23,"effort, and money to hunt this person down >.>"
m_ex_rupee_03_24,What can I do to let off some steam?
m_ex_rupee_03_25,Go shopping.
m_ex_rupee_03_26,"But I've already gone for a massive shopping session,"
m_ex_rupee_03_27,so I don't think there's anything else I'd like to buy :(
m_ex_rupee_03_28,I'll accompany you.
m_ex_rupee_03_29,You and I
m_ex_rupee_03_30,go shopping together?
m_ex_rupee_03_31,"Yes, I'd love that!! :D"
m_ex_rupee_03_32,All the upcoming designs will be perfect for you.
m_ex_rupee_03_33,So I can just take a step back and
m_ex_rupee_03_34,find the ones that suit you best!
m_ex_rupee_03_35,"Anyway, I'll let you know when they arrive."
m_ex_rupee_03_36,Got it.
m_ex_rupee_03_37,"Gosh, I'm so excited!! :3"
m_ex_rupee_03_38,"Thanks, Sweetie!"
m_ex_signal_01_1,Umm...
m_ex_signal_01_2,Hello!
m_ex_signal_01_3,I'm Signal. We're going on this mission together!
m_ex_signal_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_signal_01_5,Nice to meet you too!
m_ex_signal_01_6,Um...
m_ex_signal_01_7,Actually...
m_ex_signal_01_8,The reason why I'm texting you today
m_ex_signal_01_9,is that I wanted to ask you something.
m_ex_signal_01_10,Say it.
m_ex_signal_01_11,Do you...
m_ex_signal_01_12,"like watching TV, movies, and things like that?"
m_ex_signal_01_13,"Yeah, I guess."
m_ex_signal_01_14,I don't like or hate it.
m_ex_signal_01_15,"Oh, I see!"
m_ex_signal_01_16,"Ah,"
m_ex_signal_01_17,I see.
m_ex_signal_01_18,How about you? Do you like watching TV series?
m_ex_signal_01_19,"You mean, me?"
m_ex_signal_01_20,Speaking of which...
m_ex_signal_01_21,There was no reply for a long time.
m_ex_signal_01_22,Signal?
m_ex_signal_01_23,I'm right here.
m_ex_signal_01_24,Is there anything that's difficult for you to talk about?
m_ex_signal_01_25,"No, no... It's just..."
m_ex_signal_01_26,I was afraid that you might have issues
m_ex_signal_01_27,and was opposed to
m_ex_signal_01_28,Nikkes watching TV
m_ex_signal_01_29,or stuff like that.
m_ex_signal_01_30,"Don't worry, I don't."
m_ex_signal_01_31,"Ah, that's awesome!"
m_ex_signal_01_32,"Yes, I absolutely love TV series!"
m_ex_signal_01_33,But!
m_ex_signal_01_34,I only watch it during breaks.
m_ex_signal_01_35,It doesn't interfere with the missions assigned to me at all.
m_ex_signal_01_36,"Plus, I only watch the TV in the dorm."
m_ex_signal_01_37,It's true!
m_ex_signal_01_38,"Actually, it's okay to watch it outside the dorm."
m_ex_signal_01_39,!!
m_ex_signal_01_40,Really?
m_ex_signal_01_41,Yes.
m_ex_signal_01_42,Gasp!!
m_ex_signal_01_43,"You are so generous, Commander!"
m_ex_signal_01_44,Thanks.
m_ex_signal_01_45,I will definitely work hard!
m_ex_signal_01_46,"Really, really hard!"
m_ex_signal_01_47,"All right, then. I look forward to working with you."
m_ex_signal_01_48,Me too!
m_ex_signal_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_signal_02_2,are you busy right now?
m_ex_signal_02_3,"No, I'm free."
m_ex_signal_02_4,"Commander, suppose you received"
m_ex_signal_02_5,"a gift you'd wanted for some time,"
m_ex_signal_02_6,"and unexpectedly, I might add."
m_ex_signal_02_7,How would you feel?
m_ex_signal_02_8,I'd be over the moon.
m_ex_signal_02_9,I'd be pretty happy.
m_ex_signal_02_10,"You'd be thrilled, right?"
m_ex_signal_02_11,"Sorry, typo."
m_ex_signal_02_12,I'm so excited that my hands are shaking.
m_ex_signal_02_13,"Yes, happiness!"
m_ex_signal_02_14,That's exactly how I feel.
m_ex_signal_02_15,What's going on?
m_ex_signal_02_16,"There's this movie I've been looking forward to,"
m_ex_signal_02_17,Sensational Love.
m_ex_signal_02_18,I won a ticket to the premiere.
m_ex_signal_02_19,Congratulations!
m_ex_signal_02_20,Thanks!
m_ex_signal_02_21,I can't believe I'll be able to see it
m_ex_signal_02_22,before its release.
m_ex_signal_02_23,But...
m_ex_signal_02_24,Umm...
m_ex_signal_02_25,Well...
m_ex_signal_02_26,"It states that I can bring a plus one,"
m_ex_signal_02_27,but I haven't found anybody to go with yet.
m_ex_signal_02_28,"Will you be available to join me, Commander?"
m_ex_signal_02_29,"Of course, I totally understand"
m_ex_signal_02_30,if you're busy!
m_ex_signal_02_31,My schedule is pretty packed this month.
m_ex_signal_02_32,Let's do it.
m_ex_signal_02_33,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_signal_02_34,I guess there's nothing you can do about that
m_ex_signal_02_35,...
m_ex_signal_02_36,right?
m_ex_signal_02_37,Just kidding. Let's go together.
m_ex_signal_02_38,Wow. R-really?!
m_ex_signal_02_39,My heart... beating... too fast...
m_ex_signal_02_40,"Thank you so much, Commander!!"
m_ex_signal_02_41,Did you come up with a question yet?
m_ex_signal_02_42,Huh?
m_ex_signal_02_43,Question?
m_ex_signal_02_44,What question?
m_ex_signal_02_45,You can ask the actors or director a question at the premiere.
m_ex_signal_02_46,Gasp!
m_ex_signal_02_47,A question!!
m_ex_signal_02_48,I have no idea!
m_ex_signal_02_49,"Oh man, what if I end up asking them"
m_ex_signal_02_50,an offensive question? T^T
m_ex_signal_02_51,They may even ask me to leave for being rude.
m_ex_signal_02_52,You can always prepare your question ahead of time.
m_ex_signal_02_53,"Hey, you're right!"
m_ex_signal_02_54,"If I figure out what to ask them beforehand,"
m_ex_signal_02_55,I won't be so nervous.
m_ex_signal_02_56,Hmm...
m_ex_signal_02_57,Hmmmm...
m_ex_signal_02_58,What should I ask?
m_ex_signal_02_59,What is true love?
m_ex_signal_02_60,Why was this scene shot this way?
m_ex_signal_02_61,Hmm...
m_ex_signal_02_62,"I'm no cinephile,"
m_ex_signal_02_63,so I'm not sure I'd even understand their answer.
m_ex_signal_02_64,What is true love?
m_ex_signal_02_65,Wow!
m_ex_signal_02_66,True love!!
m_ex_signal_02_67,That's right! Those who have to act out love scenes
m_ex_signal_02_68,"must know a lot about all that,"
m_ex_signal_02_69,right?
m_ex_signal_02_70,"Thank you, Commander!!"
m_ex_signal_02_71,I'll let you know the exact date and time later.
m_ex_signal_02_72,Okay.
m_ex_signal_03_1,Commander.
m_ex_signal_03_2,What are you doing right now?
m_ex_signal_03_3,"Nothing, just spacing out."
m_ex_signal_03_4,Ah!!
m_ex_signal_03_5,Something on your mind?
m_ex_signal_03_6,"I was gonna watch a TV series,"
m_ex_signal_03_7,but another show caught my eye.
m_ex_signal_03_8,It's called Guess that Spelling!
m_ex_signal_03_9,They used tons of words that were much harder than I expected...
m_ex_signal_03_10,So I've gotten most of them wrong.
m_ex_signal_03_11,"If you're not doing anything, would you like to join me?"
m_ex_signal_03_12,Sure.
m_ex_signal_03_13,"All right, first question!"
m_ex_signal_03_14,The Pharaoh of Egypt VS The Pharoah of Egypt
m_ex_signal_03_15,The Pharoah of Egypt
m_ex_signal_03_16,The Pharaoh of Egypt
m_ex_signal_03_17,"Uh oh! You've got it wrong, Commander!"
m_ex_signal_03_18,Correct!
m_ex_signal_03_19,"All right, second question."
m_ex_signal_03_20,Separate VS Seperate
m_ex_signal_03_21,Seperate
m_ex_signal_03_22,Separate
m_ex_signal_03_23,"Sorry, that's incorrect!"
m_ex_signal_03_24,"Wow, how'd you know that?"
m_ex_signal_03_25,Final round.
m_ex_signal_03_26,Mayonaisse vs Mayonnaise.
m_ex_signal_03_27,Mayonaisse
m_ex_signal_03_28,Mayonnaise
m_ex_signal_03_29,I thought it was mayonaisse too.
m_ex_signal_03_30,You're so good at this!
m_ex_signal_03_31,"It's much harder than you thought, right?"
m_ex_signal_03_32,"While watching this show,"
m_ex_signal_03_33,"I felt like I was actually learning something, not just being entertained."
m_ex_signal_03_34,That was fun.
m_ex_signal_03_35,You think so?
m_ex_signal_03_36,Yes.
m_ex_signal_03_37,I'm glad!
m_ex_signal_03_38,Then I'll be back with another quiz next time!
m_ex_signal_03_39,"Oh, my show's starting!"
m_ex_signal_03_40,Talk to you next time!
m_ex_signal_03_41,Okay.
m_ex_snowwhite_01_1,"The Recruit signal has reached me.
I've been using a top-secret line, so how did it reach here?
The chances of it being a pure coincidence is high.
But, I don't believe in chances.
Your signal reaching me must be something that is meant to be."
m_ex_snowwhite_01_2,What a long message.
m_ex_snowwhite_01_3,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_01_4,"Sorry for my late reply. It's because I was busy dealing with the Raptures nearby.
It isn't easy to send a message on the surface.
That's why I need to send many messages at once.
I prefer to talk to you in person, but it won't be easy to talk face to face since I'm often on the surface.
It's an inevitable issue unless you come up to the surface often."
m_ex_snowwhite_01_5,Will we meet each other if I head to the surface?
m_ex_snowwhite_01_6,There is no reply for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_01_7,"Sorry for the late reply again.
There was canned food nearby, so I went to eat.
Even if you come up to the surface, you wouldn't be able to see me right away.
It'll probably be much quicker if I come to you instead.
So just let me know if you ever need any help.
I can join you whenever it's physically possible, especially considering the distance.
Now I'm going to attack a group of Raptures, so I won't be replying anytime soon.
I'll see you next time."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_1,"Whenever you go up to the surface, do you bring food with you? 
It would be a good idea to do so, 
in case you get yourself in trouble."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_2,Thanks for the advice.
m_ex_snowwhite_02_3,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_4,"No need to thank me.
I'm simply stating the obvious.
Food supplies have been limited recently,
so I thought I'd let you know."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_5,Has it been difficult to find food?
m_ex_snowwhite_02_6,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_7,"Procuring food on this planet is a process of giving and taking.
Unless you are farming like Scarlet,
occasional scarcity is natural and unavoidable.
So take good care of your rations."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_8,"I'm curious, what do you want to eat most?"
m_ex_snowwhite_02_9,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_10,"My apologies for the late response.
I was considering if it was something
I wanted to eat right now
or at a later date. 
I gave it some thought,
and I've come to a conclusion."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_11,There isn't any reply for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_12,"There is no food I crave more than any other.
Food is not something you can pick and choose.
All food is precious sustenance.
You should not divide it into different classes by declaring one your favorite or anything.
This is my conclusion.
I have made you wait too long for my answer.
For that, I apologize."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_13,Then is it all right if I bring any food to the surface?
m_ex_snowwhite_02_14,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_15,You mean you will be bringing food up for me?
m_ex_snowwhite_02_16,Yes.
m_ex_snowwhite_02_17,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_18,"This is the first time someone has done something like this for me.
If you say you will bring me food,
I will not refuse.
Thank you.
My apologies for the late response again."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_19,"It's okay, it's not a big deal."
m_ex_snowwhite_02_20,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_02_21,"Good.
I'll be heading to a different location,
so I must end our communication here.
There is no need to reply to this message.
Call me whenever you come to the surface with food.
I'll come and locate you."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_1,Do you happen to know a Commander named Connor Wilson?
m_ex_snowwhite_03_2,I don't.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_3,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_03_4,"I see.
While searching through the ruins,
I found an ID card in the hands of a fallen Nikke.
If this Connor Wilson is still alive,
I was hoping you could return it to him for me."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_5,I'll look it up on the intranet.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_6,"Searched for ""Connor Wilson"" on the Central Government intranet."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_7,"According to this, he's retired."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_8,"Then this card won't be of much use to him anymore.
I will bury it along with the fallen Nikkes."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_9,Wouldn't it be best to return it to him anyway?
m_ex_snowwhite_03_10,There isn't any reply from Snow White for a long time...
m_ex_snowwhite_03_11,To Connor Wilson? Why?
m_ex_snowwhite_03_12,I want him to remember the Nikkes under his command.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_13,I feel like it'd give some meaning to the Nikkes' death.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_14,"If it is for the Nikkes' sake,
then all the more reason not to.
They paid the ultimate price to save what they wanted to protect.
And because of their sacrifice, Connor Wilson is still alive today."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_15,"I'm more worried about how you will feel
when you find out he doesn't remember these Nikkes.
So just bury them all."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_16,Wait.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_17,Failed to send message.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_18,"Even if he has forgotten,
it's still his duty to remember."
m_ex_snowwhite_03_19,Failed to send message.
m_ex_snowwhite_03_20,Snow White seems to have entered a no-communication zone...
m_ex_soline_01_1,"Hi, Commander!!"
m_ex_soline_01_2,I'm Soline.
m_ex_soline_01_3,Word is that we're gonna be working together.
m_ex_soline_01_4,Look forward to it! Hahaha.
m_ex_soline_01_5,Likewise.
m_ex_soline_01_6,Having such a capable Nikke by your side
m_ex_soline_01_7,must really put you at ease.
m_ex_soline_01_8,"Don't you worry, Commander,"
m_ex_soline_01_9,you can leave everything to me.
m_ex_soline_01_10,You sound pretty reliable.
m_ex_soline_01_11,I sure am!
m_ex_soline_01_12,You can bet your bottom dollar!
m_ex_soline_01_13,Hahaha.
m_ex_soline_01_14,A problematic passenger
m_ex_soline_01_15,"got on my nerves today,"
m_ex_soline_01_16,but chatting with you makes me feel much better.
m_ex_soline_01_17,What happened?
m_ex_soline_01_18,"Well, it's always dangerous whenever"
m_ex_soline_01_19,"the train arrives at the station,"
m_ex_soline_01_20,so I asked this passenger to step back a bit.
m_ex_soline_01_21,"However, he flips out on me all of a sudden,"
m_ex_soline_01_22,stating that he can stand wherever he pleases.
m_ex_soline_01_23,I was just reminding him for his own safety!
m_ex_soline_01_24,I don't understand why he got so upset.
m_ex_soline_01_25,"Anyway, I still tried my best to end the conversation with a smile."
m_ex_soline_01_26,"Gosh, I'm starting to feel angry again"
m_ex_soline_01_27,just thinking about it.
m_ex_soline_01_28,That was really professional of you!
m_ex_soline_01_29,Really? You think so?
m_ex_soline_01_30,That was very mature of you.
m_ex_soline_01_31,"Hahaha, I guess you're right."
m_ex_soline_01_32,I feel a lot better
m_ex_soline_01_33,after chatting with you.
m_ex_soline_01_34,"Thanks for listening to me, Commander."
m_ex_soline_01_35,I'm always here for you.
m_ex_soline_01_36,Now you're the reliable one!
m_ex_soline_01_37,"Well, break time's over! Gotta go."
m_ex_soline_01_38,Looking forward to working with you!
m_ex_soline_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_soline_02_2,I was thinking about
m_ex_soline_02_3,how to use the trains
m_ex_soline_02_4,more...
m_ex_soline_02_5,effectively?
m_ex_soline_02_6,What makes you think about that?
m_ex_soline_02_7,Because I heard that a company
m_ex_soline_02_8,can earn much more
m_ex_soline_02_9,"if it has competent employees, hehe."
m_ex_soline_02_10,"Anyway, I have two plans."
m_ex_soline_02_11,Would you like to hear about them?
m_ex_soline_02_12,"Sure, why not?"
m_ex_soline_02_13,Plan A goes like this.
m_ex_soline_02_14,I'll dress up as an adorable train
m_ex_soline_02_15,when I check the passengers' tickets at the station.
m_ex_soline_02_16,"That way, our train station will"
m_ex_soline_02_17,go viral on the internet.
m_ex_soline_02_18,"People will come just to take a photo,"
m_ex_soline_02_19,even if they're not planning on riding the train.
m_ex_soline_02_20,"However, there will be a long line for passengers to get their tickets checked."
m_ex_soline_02_21,Yup!
m_ex_soline_02_22,Super long!
m_ex_soline_02_23,... Wait a minute...
m_ex_soline_02_24,Now I'm not so sure that's a good thing :|
m_ex_soline_02_25,"If the line is too long,"
m_ex_soline_02_26,won't there be a surge in the number of complaints?
m_ex_soline_02_27,Most certainly.
m_ex_soline_02_28,Hmm...
m_ex_soline_02_29,then Plan A won't do!
m_ex_soline_02_30,"Anyhoo,"
m_ex_soline_02_31,"that doesn't matter,"
m_ex_soline_02_32,cuz I have Plan B.
m_ex_soline_02_33,This one's gonna work for sure.
m_ex_soline_02_34,It goes like this.
m_ex_soline_02_35,Passengers will get a coupon each time they take a train.
m_ex_soline_02_36,"Once they collect 10 coupons,"
m_ex_soline_02_37,they can exchange them for a bag of candies.
m_ex_soline_02_38,"That way, they can enjoy some nice candies while taking the train."
m_ex_soline_02_39,So it's a win-win for everyone!
m_ex_soline_02_40,Who could possibly resist
m_ex_soline_02_41,a plan like this?
m_ex_soline_02_42,I'm sure there are some.
m_ex_soline_02_43,"Haha, good idea!"
m_ex_soline_02_44,Huh?
m_ex_soline_02_45,Who?
m_ex_soline_02_46,"Oh, right! Some people may not be happy"
m_ex_soline_02_47,about the flavor of candy they end up getting.
m_ex_soline_02_48,"In that case, I'll let them choose whatever flavor they want."
m_ex_soline_02_49,That's not the issue.
m_ex_soline_02_50,"Bah, I don't care!"
m_ex_soline_02_51,"This is the plan, and I'm sticking to it!"
m_ex_soline_02_52,I'm gonna bring it up with Brid.
m_ex_soline_02_53,... Do you really think so?
m_ex_soline_02_54,Then how come you laughed in the beginning?
m_ex_soline_02_55,It makes me a little uneasy...
m_ex_soline_02_56,How about you discuss this with Brid first?
m_ex_soline_02_57,I'm gonna do just that.
m_ex_soline_02_58,Mark my words.
m_ex_soline_02_59,"Pretty soon, you'll be seeing candy coupons"
m_ex_soline_02_60,"at every Ark Express station, just like I planned!"
m_ex_soline_02_61,Can't wait.
m_ex_soline_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_soline_03_2,are you busy?
m_ex_soline_03_3,"Nope, what's up?"
m_ex_soline_03_4,"Um... well,"
m_ex_soline_03_5,"since you're not judgmental, I wanted to ask you"
m_ex_soline_03_6,whether or not you think it's childish to have a sweet tooth?
m_ex_soline_03_7,What makes you ask?
m_ex_soline_03_8,Well...
m_ex_soline_03_9,I've a young friend who
m_ex_soline_03_10,"loves to eat sweets,"
m_ex_soline_03_11,so people always end up treating her like a little kid.
m_ex_soline_03_12,She told me that she tried to stop eating as much candy
m_ex_soline_03_13,"to counter this, but it inevitably"
m_ex_soline_03_14,puts her in a foul mood.
m_ex_soline_03_15,Do you happen to have any solutions?
m_ex_soline_03_16,I have a sweet tooth myself.
m_ex_soline_03_17,Really?
m_ex_soline_03_18,Do I seem childish to you?
m_ex_soline_03_19,"No, not at all."
m_ex_soline_03_20,"Hey, that's it!"
m_ex_soline_03_21,Having a sweet tooth isn't the issue!
m_ex_soline_03_22,"Exactly, so tell your friend not to let others get her down."
m_ex_soline_03_23,So it's okay to have a sweet tooth?
m_ex_soline_03_24,Of course.
m_ex_soline_03_25,Woo-hoo!
m_ex_soline_03_26,This was really bugging me for the past couple of days.
m_ex_soline_03_27,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_soline_03_28,Remember to pass what I've said onto your friend.
m_ex_soline_03_29,Who?
m_ex_soline_03_30,Oh! Um... right!
m_ex_soline_03_31,I'll be sure to tell her...
m_ex_soline_03_32,I'm sure you will.
m_ex_sugar_01_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_sugar_01_2,do you like motorbikes?
m_ex_sugar_01_3,"I do, though I don't really ride them that well."
m_ex_sugar_01_4,Really?
m_ex_sugar_01_5,You said
m_ex_sugar_01_6,you are at the Outpost?
m_ex_sugar_01_7,Yes.
m_ex_sugar_01_8,Is that a good place for riding?
m_ex_sugar_01_9,"It's really wide, definitely suitable for motorbikes."
m_ex_sugar_01_10,The Ark is far too small.
m_ex_sugar_01_11,I'd always encounter an obstacle whenever I try to speed up.
m_ex_sugar_01_12,Sounds like a hassle to ride there.
m_ex_sugar_01_13,"Oh,"
m_ex_sugar_01_14,"that's because I never slow down,"
m_ex_sugar_01_15,just hit the gas and speed away.
m_ex_sugar_01_16,"That way, she doesn't slow down as much."
m_ex_sugar_01_17,??
m_ex_sugar_01_18,"Whatever,"
m_ex_sugar_01_19,I will be there soon.
m_ex_sugar_01_20,Let's ride together.
m_ex_sugar_01_21,Sure. Anytime.
m_ex_sugar_01_22,Anytime?
m_ex_sugar_01_23,"Great, I'll come now."
m_ex_sugar_01_24,Get your motorbike ready.
m_ex_sugar_01_25,"By the way, what's your bike model?"
m_ex_sugar_01_26,SWORD-ZII
m_ex_sugar_01_27,KNIGHT-AOZ
m_ex_sugar_01_28,Oh.
m_ex_sugar_01_29,Nice choice.
m_ex_sugar_01_30,"It's an old-type, but a masterpiece,"
m_ex_sugar_01_31,and has an excellent design.
m_ex_sugar_01_32,"It may not be obvious to everybody,"
m_ex_sugar_01_33,but you have quite an eye.
m_ex_sugar_01_34,You're exaggerating.
m_ex_sugar_01_35,There is not a single bad person among bike-lovers.
m_ex_sugar_01_36,"From now on, you are going to be my partner."
m_ex_sugar_01_37,"Glad to be with you, partner."
m_ex_sugar_01_38,Okay then.
m_ex_sugar_01_39,"See you soon,"
m_ex_sugar_01_40,Partner.
m_ex_sugar_02_1,"Hey, Partner."
m_ex_sugar_02_2,I was wondering...
m_ex_sugar_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_sugar_02_4,What do you think is the best time to ride a bike?
m_ex_sugar_02_5,Dawn.
m_ex_sugar_02_6,Midday.
m_ex_sugar_02_7,Dawn?
m_ex_sugar_02_8,"The sky begins to light up,"
m_ex_sugar_02_9,as you feel the cool breeze on your face.
m_ex_sugar_02_10,"But everyone's still sleeping at that point,"
m_ex_sugar_02_11,so it might be too early
m_ex_sugar_02_12,to really rev Black Typhoon's engine.
m_ex_sugar_02_13,Midday?
m_ex_sugar_02_14,"Nothing beats going for a great ride while feeling the sun on your back,"
m_ex_sugar_02_15,but everyone is out and about by then.
m_ex_sugar_02_16,"Even if the roads are wide, the streets are filled with numerous pedestrians,"
m_ex_sugar_02_17,so you can't let loose while you ride.
m_ex_sugar_02_18,"After all, you wouldn't want to be crashing into people."
m_ex_sugar_02_19,Hmm...
m_ex_sugar_02_20,What's the matter?
m_ex_sugar_02_21,I had some business
m_ex_sugar_02_22,in the Ark a few days ago.
m_ex_sugar_02_23,"There I was, riding and minding my own business,"
m_ex_sugar_02_24,but everyone was giving me grief.
m_ex_sugar_02_25,"If it's during the day, people say it's too dangerous."
m_ex_sugar_02_26,"If it's during the night, people say it's too noisy."
m_ex_sugar_02_27,So you weren't able to ride your bike?
m_ex_sugar_02_28,No.
m_ex_sugar_02_29,"I didn't pay them any mind, and kept on riding."
m_ex_sugar_02_30,What is that?
m_ex_sugar_02_31,That's why I wanted to ask you
m_ex_sugar_02_32,what's the best time to ride.
m_ex_sugar_02_33,I see.
m_ex_sugar_02_34,I'm starting to like this place.
m_ex_sugar_02_35,"There are fewer people, and"
m_ex_sugar_02_36,no one will complain as long as
m_ex_sugar_02_37,I stay away from the residential areas at night.
m_ex_sugar_02_38,"If I ride my bike here, I can do it whenever I wish to without worrying about anything."
m_ex_sugar_02_39,"Having said that, fancy going on a ride together later?"
m_ex_sugar_02_40,Sounds good.
m_ex_sugar_02_41,"Cool, then I'll be in touch."
m_ex_sugar_03_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_sugar_03_2,is anything on your mind?
m_ex_sugar_03_3,Not really.
m_ex_sugar_03_4,No.
m_ex_sugar_03_5,Think harder.
m_ex_sugar_03_6,I'm sure there is something.
m_ex_sugar_03_7,How so??
m_ex_sugar_03_8,"I really want to swap a part on my bike,"
m_ex_sugar_03_9,but I haven't been getting much work.
m_ex_sugar_03_10,It's weird.
m_ex_sugar_03_11,The Ark and Outpost are filled with people
m_ex_sugar_03_12,"who have fallen on hard times, but"
m_ex_sugar_03_13,the Scavengers haven't gotten any requests.
m_ex_sugar_03_14,It's because of Frima's laziness.
m_ex_sugar_03_15,It's because Milk sells so much coffee.
m_ex_sugar_03_16,Ah.
m_ex_sugar_03_17,I get it.
m_ex_sugar_03_18,She's always turning down customers because she doesn't feel like serving them.
m_ex_sugar_03_19,I've already seen it happen three times today.
m_ex_sugar_03_20,Ah.
m_ex_sugar_03_21,I get it.
m_ex_sugar_03_22,That's been bugging me too.
m_ex_sugar_03_23,Why is it always milk coffee rather than sugar coffee?
m_ex_sugar_03_24,What?
m_ex_sugar_03_25,"Anyway, I've gotten to the bottom of it, so don't worry about it."
m_ex_sugar_03_26,I'll try
m_ex_sugar_03_27,and resolve this by myself.
m_ex_sugar_03_28,"Thanks for the advice,"
m_ex_sugar_03_29,Partner.
m_ex_sugar_03_30,You're welcome.
m_ex_sugar_03_31,"Next time we see each other, let's grab a coffee."
m_ex_sugar_03_32,Talk to you later.
m_ex_yuni_01_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_yuni_01_2,any spare time?
m_ex_yuni_01_3,I wanna come and play with you.
m_ex_yuni_01_4,Sure.
m_ex_yuni_01_5,Okay.
m_ex_yuni_01_6,Do you need anything?
m_ex_yuni_01_7,What do you mean?
m_ex_yuni_01_8,"Ah, well."
m_ex_yuni_01_9,Not really what you need but
m_ex_yuni_01_10,more of what you like.
m_ex_yuni_01_11,"Let me know what you like,"
m_ex_yuni_01_12,then I'll bring it to you.
m_ex_yuni_01_13,Anything would be fine I guess.
m_ex_yuni_01_14,Really?
m_ex_yuni_01_15,Okay then choose one.
m_ex_yuni_01_16,Leather or steel?
m_ex_yuni_01_17,Leather.
m_ex_yuni_01_18,Steel.
m_ex_yuni_01_19,I see.
m_ex_yuni_01_20,"Then,"
m_ex_yuni_01_21,I will bring a whip made out of leather.
m_ex_yuni_01_22,Huh?
m_ex_yuni_01_23,That is my precious collection.
m_ex_yuni_01_24,Steel?
m_ex_yuni_01_25,Okay.
m_ex_yuni_01_26,I will then bring you handcuffs.
m_ex_yuni_01_27,Handcuffs?
m_ex_yuni_01_28,"They are really hard to find,"
m_ex_yuni_01_29,"but I think you will like them, Commander."
m_ex_yuni_01_30,Maybe there is a misunderstanding.
m_ex_yuni_01_31,"Oh, Commander."
m_ex_yuni_01_32,Don't be shy.
m_ex_yuni_01_33,"Mihara said that everyone has this kind of instinct,"
m_ex_yuni_01_34,but most people choose to hide it
m_ex_yuni_01_35,because they feel embarrassed.
m_ex_yuni_01_36,It's completely wrong.
m_ex_yuni_01_37,"Look,"
m_ex_yuni_01_38,you're shy again.
m_ex_yuni_01_39,"You know,"
m_ex_yuni_01_40,you can show everything to Yuni.
m_ex_yuni_01_41,Okay?
m_ex_yuni_01_42,Wait a sec.
m_ex_yuni_01_43,I will be there soon.
m_ex_yuni_01_44,"See you in a bit, Commander!"
m_ex_yuni_01_45,Let's have fun together!
m_ex_yuni_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_yuni_02_2,what are you doing?
m_ex_yuni_02_3,I was thinking about you.
m_ex_yuni_02_4,I was going to send you a message on blabla.
m_ex_yuni_02_5,Wow!
m_ex_yuni_02_6,Me too!
m_ex_yuni_02_7,What are you up to?
m_ex_yuni_02_8,I was just picking out a leash.
m_ex_yuni_02_9,A leash?
m_ex_yuni_02_10,Yes!
m_ex_yuni_02_11,"With that being said,"
m_ex_yuni_02_12,which color do you prefer?
m_ex_yuni_02_13,Black.
m_ex_yuni_02_14,White.
m_ex_yuni_02_15,I also think
m_ex_yuni_02_16,black is more suitable.
m_ex_yuni_02_17,White is too bright.
m_ex_yuni_02_18,"I like black, so"
m_ex_yuni_02_19,something that's black will make a fine present.
m_ex_yuni_02_20,A present?
m_ex_yuni_02_21,Yes.
m_ex_yuni_02_22,I'm giving someone I like a gift.
m_ex_yuni_02_23,Mihara?
m_ex_yuni_02_24,"No, my second favorite person."
m_ex_yuni_02_25,You'll find out soon enough.
m_ex_yuni_02_26,Commander.
m_ex_yuni_02_27,Where are you now?
m_ex_yuni_02_28,I don't think I should tell her I'm in the Commander's Room.
m_ex_yuni_02_29,I'm up on the surface.
m_ex_yuni_02_30,The surface?
m_ex_yuni_02_31,I just saw Anis and Neon.
m_ex_yuni_02_32,Who did you go with? Rapi?
m_ex_yuni_02_33,"In that case,"
m_ex_yuni_02_34,I'll wait in your room.
m_ex_yuni_02_35,??
m_ex_yuni_02_36,I'll see you momentarily.
m_ex_yuni_02_37,I need to get out of here before Yuni arrives.
m_ex_yuni_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_yuni_03_2,have you seen Mihara?
m_ex_yuni_03_3,"Nope, I've not."
m_ex_yuni_03_4,What should I do?
m_ex_yuni_03_5,"We had fun all day yesterday,"
m_ex_yuni_03_6,"but now I can't find her,"
m_ex_yuni_03_7,no matter where I look.
m_ex_yuni_03_8,Perhaps you took things a little too far?
m_ex_yuni_03_9,Maybe her preferences have changed since.
m_ex_yuni_03_10,"That may be so,"
m_ex_yuni_03_11,but Mihara was enjoying herself as well.
m_ex_yuni_03_12,I'm sure of that.
m_ex_yuni_03_13,"Commander,"
m_ex_yuni_03_14,I'm being serious.
m_ex_yuni_03_15,I would appreciate it if you could take this seriously as well.
m_ex_yuni_03_16,Sorry.
m_ex_yuni_03_17,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_yuni_03_18,we were playing with a new toy yesterday.
m_ex_yuni_03_19,Perhaps she didn't like it?
m_ex_yuni_03_20,What kind of toy was it?
m_ex_yuni_03_21,"It was red, long and sticky."
m_ex_yuni_03_22,"It was barbed as well, and..."
m_ex_yuni_03_23,"That's enough, thank you."
m_ex_yuni_03_24,If you say so.
m_ex_yuni_03_25,"Anyways,"
m_ex_yuni_03_26,I don't think it was enough to satisfy her.
m_ex_yuni_03_27,I'll have to work harder from now on.
m_ex_yuni_03_28,I don't think that's necessary.
m_ex_yuni_03_29,I have research to do.
m_ex_yuni_03_30,I have to find a toy Mihara will enjoy when she returns.
m_ex_yuni_03_31,"If I find one,"
m_ex_yuni_03_32,you should come to play with us as well.
m_ex_yuni_03_33,The more the merrier.
m_ex_yuni_03_34,"Sure, will do."
m_ex_yuni_03_35,Um... maybe later.
m_ex_yuni_03_36,Okay.
m_ex_yuni_03_37,Pinky swear.
m_ex_yuni_03_38,See you soon.
m_ex_vesti_01_1,Gasp!
m_ex_vesti_01_2,Is this the Commander?
m_ex_vesti_01_3,Can you receive my messages?
m_ex_vesti_01_4,"Yes, I can."
m_ex_vesti_01_5,Great :D
m_ex_vesti_01_6,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_vesti_01_7,"Hey,"
m_ex_vesti_01_8,that's my line!
m_ex_vesti_01_9,"Nice to meet you, too, Commander."
m_ex_vesti_01_10,Oh!
m_ex_vesti_01_11,"What are you up to,"
m_ex_vesti_01_12,Commander?
m_ex_vesti_01_13,Just having fun talking to you.
m_ex_vesti_01_14,Just relaxing.
m_ex_vesti_01_15,Do you really enjoy
m_ex_vesti_01_16,talking to me that much?
m_ex_vesti_01_17,Of course.
m_ex_vesti_01_18,"I'm not disturbing you,"
m_ex_vesti_01_19,am I?
m_ex_vesti_01_20,Chatting with you is very relaxing in itself.
m_ex_vesti_01_21,"Thanks for saying so, Commander :P"
m_ex_vesti_01_22,Is this how it feels
m_ex_vesti_01_23,to chat with a friend?
m_ex_vesti_01_24,This is the first time
m_ex_vesti_01_25,"I've really ever chatted with someone,"
m_ex_vesti_01_26,so I feel a bit awkward.
m_ex_vesti_01_27,Will you still text me in the future?
m_ex_vesti_01_28,We can chat whenever we're bored.
m_ex_vesti_01_29,Really?
m_ex_vesti_01_30,But I'm afraid it would be impolite if I text you every day.
m_ex_vesti_01_31,Oh no...
m_ex_vesti_01_32,Eunhwa is calling me. I gotta go :(
m_ex_vesti_01_33,"I'll contact you whenever I'm free, Commander."
m_ex_vesti_01_34,Sure thing.
m_ex_vesti_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_02_2,can I ask you something?
m_ex_vesti_02_3,Are you free now?
m_ex_vesti_02_4,Yep.
m_ex_vesti_02_5,"Phew,"
m_ex_vesti_02_6,thanks! T^T
m_ex_vesti_02_7,"Not long ago,"
m_ex_vesti_02_8,my squadmates and I
m_ex_vesti_02_9,fought alongside another squad.
m_ex_vesti_02_10,"However,"
m_ex_vesti_02_11,they've been avoiding me
m_ex_vesti_02_12,ever since we returned :(
m_ex_vesti_02_13,Did you have some sort of disagreement during the battle?
m_ex_vesti_02_14,Did something happen?
m_ex_vesti_02_15,I don't think so.
m_ex_vesti_02_16,I don't recall being in a fight with them.
m_ex_vesti_02_17,But this isn't the first time.
m_ex_vesti_02_18,The same thing happened with other squads as well.
m_ex_vesti_02_19,Do you think I said something
m_ex_vesti_02_20,that weirded them out?
m_ex_vesti_02_21,Vesti.
m_ex_vesti_02_22,Yes?
m_ex_vesti_02_23,Not everything is your fault.
m_ex_vesti_02_24,Huh?
m_ex_vesti_02_25,"Sorry, Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_02_26,but I don't understand...
m_ex_vesti_02_27,What I mean is that you haven't necessarily done anything wrong.
m_ex_vesti_02_28,Really?
m_ex_vesti_02_29,"Sometimes, people will dislike you for no reason at all."
m_ex_vesti_02_30,Maybe they're just jealous of you.
m_ex_vesti_02_31,That does
m_ex_vesti_02_32,make sense...
m_ex_vesti_02_33,But I've been so nice to them this whole time.
m_ex_vesti_02_34,Why would they feel that way about me?
m_ex_vesti_02_35,Hmm...
m_ex_vesti_02_36,"I'm not sure,"
m_ex_vesti_02_37,but why would they
m_ex_vesti_02_38,be jealous?
m_ex_vesti_02_39,I just can't seem to figure it out :(
m_ex_vesti_02_40,"Either way, what you said does"
m_ex_vesti_02_41,make me feel much better!
m_ex_vesti_02_42,I'm glad I asked you about this.
m_ex_vesti_02_43,:3
m_ex_vesti_02_44,"Now that I think about it, I really threw myself into the fray"
m_ex_vesti_02_45,this time around so that we could come back early.
m_ex_vesti_02_46,I wanted to shorten the battle by a few days
m_ex_vesti_02_47,so I could see you.
m_ex_vesti_02_48,I suppose that squad didn't achieve much of anything.
m_ex_vesti_02_49,Could that be why they're angry?
m_ex_vesti_02_50,Like I stole their valor or something?
m_ex_vesti_02_51,I think they're afraid of you.
m_ex_vesti_02_52,Huh? Me?
m_ex_vesti_02_53,Why?
m_ex_vesti_02_54,Because they fear they don't measure up to you.
m_ex_vesti_02_55,Because you're so much better than them.
m_ex_vesti_02_56,"So they don't necessarily hate me,"
m_ex_vesti_02_57,it's just that they feel we're not equals.
m_ex_vesti_02_58,Is that the reason why they've been treating me like this?
m_ex_vesti_02_59,I think so.
m_ex_vesti_02_60,!!
m_ex_vesti_02_61,"I see,"
m_ex_vesti_02_62,that's possible...
m_ex_vesti_02_63,I just wasted a whole day trying to figure this out on my own!
m_ex_vesti_02_64,I should have consulted you earlier...
m_ex_vesti_02_65,Happy to be of service.
m_ex_vesti_02_66,"Next time I run into any trouble,"
m_ex_vesti_02_67,I'm sure I'll need
m_ex_vesti_02_68,your services in the future!
m_ex_vesti_02_69,<3
m_ex_vesti_03_1,"Commander, are you busy?"
m_ex_vesti_03_2,There's something
m_ex_vesti_03_3,I want to show you!
m_ex_vesti_03_4,Then you can give me compliments...
m_ex_vesti_03_5,Gah! Wait! Forget about that last part!
m_ex_vesti_03_6,I'm listening.
m_ex_vesti_03_7,"Well,"
m_ex_vesti_03_8,I watched a horror movie by myself for the first time today.
m_ex_vesti_03_9,"I was super scared at first. However, I imagined that you were by my side,"
m_ex_vesti_03_10,then I wasn't so frightened.
m_ex_vesti_03_11,It seems that I have made progress.
m_ex_vesti_03_12,What was the movie about?
m_ex_vesti_03_13,You didn't close your eyes even once?
m_ex_vesti_03_14,Oh... um...
m_ex_vesti_03_15,"To be honest, I don't remember much about it."
m_ex_vesti_03_16,"There were so many terrifying moments,"
m_ex_vesti_03_17,"and I kept closing my eyes,"
m_ex_vesti_03_18,so I didn't quite get it.
m_ex_vesti_03_19,"To be honest,"
m_ex_vesti_03_20,I did have my eyes closed a lot... T^T
m_ex_vesti_03_21,"I tried my best to keep them open,"
m_ex_vesti_03_22,but I just couldn't help it...
m_ex_vesti_03_23,That doesn't really count as watching a horror movie.
m_ex_vesti_03_24,I guess it's nothing
m_ex_vesti_03_25,to be proud of then TT^TT
m_ex_vesti_03_26,But it's nice that you're willing to try.
m_ex_vesti_03_27,You think so?
m_ex_vesti_03_28,It's brave of you to face your fears.
m_ex_vesti_03_29,Really？
m_ex_vesti_03_30,You think so?
m_ex_vesti_03_31,You really think I did a good job?
m_ex_vesti_03_32,You definitely did.
m_ex_vesti_03_33,"Wow, I didn't expect a compliment like that."
m_ex_vesti_03_34,You really made my day.
m_ex_vesti_03_35,Why don't we watch a horror movie together next time?
m_ex_vesti_03_36,!!
m_ex_vesti_03_37,"You're not serious, are you?"
m_ex_vesti_03_38,"Of course, I am."
m_ex_vesti_03_39,"All right, it's official. The only way I'll ever watch a horror movie again"
m_ex_vesti_03_40,is if I'm watching one together with you.
m_ex_vesti_03_41,:D
m_ex_vesti_03_42,What time is good for you?
m_ex_vesti_03_43,How about tomorrow??
m_ex_vesti_03_44,Huh?!
m_ex_vesti_03_45,So soon?
m_ex_vesti_03_46,Is that okay?
m_ex_vesti_03_47,Of course.
m_ex_vesti_03_48,I can come to your room at say... tomorrow noon?
m_ex_vesti_03_49,Okay.
m_ex_vesti_03_50,All right!
m_ex_vesti_03_51,Tomorrow can't come soon enough! >////<
m_ex_vesti_03_52,"See you tomorrow, Commander."
m_ex_yan_01_1,Howdie.
m_ex_yan_01_2,Are you my new Commander?
m_ex_yan_01_3,"I am, nice to meet you."
m_ex_yan_01_4,Pleasure's all mine!
m_ex_yan_01_5,I heard you just graduated
m_ex_yan_01_6,from the military academy not too long ago.
m_ex_yan_01_7,You're apparently very proficient.
m_ex_yan_01_8,I'm flattered.
m_ex_yan_01_9,Just doing my duty.
m_ex_yan_01_10,You don't have to
m_ex_yan_01_11,be so modest around me.
m_ex_yan_01_12,"This isn't my first rodeo, and I've worked with plenty of Commanders before."
m_ex_yan_01_13,"Texting them is always such a bore,"
m_ex_yan_01_14,"but I'm mighty impressed by your background,"
m_ex_yan_01_15,so I figured I'd shoot you a message
m_ex_yan_01_16,and introduce myself.
m_ex_yan_01_17,I appreciate that.
m_ex_yan_01_18,You're too kind.
m_ex_yan_01_19,"I have to ask,"
m_ex_yan_01_20,do you know who I am?
m_ex_yan_01_21,A titan in the daily necessities industry.
m_ex_yan_01_22,The owner of Talentum Mall.
m_ex_yan_01_23,A marketing prodigy.
m_ex_yan_01_24,Turns out you actually
m_ex_yan_01_25,do know something about me!
m_ex_yan_01_26,"Well, unless you plan on going up to the surface in your birthday suit,"
m_ex_yan_01_27,you'll have to deal with me at least once or twice.
m_ex_yan_01_28,"As you said, I'm a businesswoman,"
m_ex_yan_01_29,and I deal primarily in basic commodities.
m_ex_yan_01_30,"If you ask me though, the most important thing"
m_ex_yan_01_31,to invest in... is people.
m_ex_yan_01_32,"So, I wonder,"
m_ex_yan_01_33,do you like tea?
m_ex_yan_01_34,"I do, but I rarely have an opportunity to drink it."
m_ex_yan_01_35,"If you're talking about Splendamin tea, then no."
m_ex_yan_01_36,Not exactly surprising.
m_ex_yan_01_37,"After all, tea is a kind of plant,"
m_ex_yan_01_38,and plants are a precious commodity around these parts.
m_ex_yan_01_39,"Nevertheless, I'm sure there's enough tea"
m_ex_yan_01_40,for us back at my office.
m_ex_yan_01_41,Splendamin tea?
m_ex_yan_01_42,How can you even compare that with actual tea?
m_ex_yan_01_43,Do you know what it's actually made with?
m_ex_yan_01_44,Forget about it. Just come to my office.
m_ex_yan_01_45,I'll prepare you some real tea.
m_ex_yan_01_46,"Tea made with real tea leaves is hard to come by,"
m_ex_yan_01_47,but there should be enough for the two of us.
m_ex_yan_01_48,We can sip some tea
m_ex_yan_01_49,and have a little discussion to see
m_ex_yan_01_50,how we can benefit from our acquaintance.
m_ex_yan_01_51,What do you think?
m_ex_yan_01_52,Sounds good to me.
m_ex_yan_01_53,"All right,"
m_ex_yan_01_54,I have a lot of work to catch up on.
m_ex_yan_01_55,We'll have to find some other time to chat.
m_ex_yan_01_56,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_yan_01_57,I'm sure we'll see each other soon.
m_ex_yan_01_58,We're bound to see each other at work.
m_ex_yan_01_59,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_yan_02_1,"Heya, Rookie,"
m_ex_yan_02_2,what are you doing?
m_ex_yan_02_3,Waiting in line for the flash sale at Talentum Mall.
m_ex_yan_02_4,What?
m_ex_yan_02_5,Is that today?
m_ex_yan_02_6,I almost forgot.
m_ex_yan_02_7,You should have mentioned it to me.
m_ex_yan_02_8,"Look at you, waiting in line just like the others."
m_ex_yan_02_9,Such a man of the people.
m_ex_yan_02_10,Anything you've got your eye on?
m_ex_yan_02_11,Some underwear.
m_ex_yan_02_12,An electric toothbrush.
m_ex_yan_02_13,Hehehe... Well...
m_ex_yan_02_14,I certainly appreciate your honesty.
m_ex_yan_02_15,Interesting!
m_ex_yan_02_16,I didn't expect you to
m_ex_yan_02_17,care so much about your oral hygiene.
m_ex_yan_02_18,"You have such white teeth already, so"
m_ex_yan_02_19,I don't think you need to brush them too much.
m_ex_yan_02_20,Anything else strike your fancy?
m_ex_yan_02_21,Hm... not really.
m_ex_yan_02_22,No problem.
m_ex_yan_02_23,Just think it over
m_ex_yan_02_24,and give me a list of what you want to buy.
m_ex_yan_02_25,"If we've got it in stock, I'll set some aside for you."
m_ex_yan_02_26,!!
m_ex_yan_02_27,Touched?
m_ex_yan_02_28,You don't have to do me any favors.
m_ex_yan_02_29,Huh? Why not?
m_ex_yan_02_30,Aren't you waiting for the flash sale?
m_ex_yan_02_31,I'd prefer to shop regularly like everyone else.
m_ex_yan_02_32,"Well, well, look at you!"
m_ex_yan_02_33,"If you ask me, you're a real sucker!"
m_ex_yan_02_34,"Fine then, if you insist, I won't do anything for you."
m_ex_yan_02_35,But don't come crying to me later
m_ex_yan_02_36,since you're the one who declined my offer.
m_ex_yan_02_37,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_yan_02_38,"While you were busy chatting with me,"
m_ex_yan_02_39,the flash sale has already ended.
m_ex_yan_02_40,!!!
m_ex_yan_02_41,"The entire mall's been picked clean. Well, toodles!"
m_ex_yan_02_42,Yan!
m_ex_yan_02_43,Yan doesn't reply to any other messages I send.
m_ex_yan_03_1,"Rookie,"
m_ex_yan_03_2,something's been bugging me.
m_ex_yan_03_3,A bug? Where?
m_ex_yan_03_4,A bug! Hehehehe
m_ex_yan_03_5,Is that supposed to be a joke?
m_ex_yan_03_6,"I'm no comedian, but I thought it was okay."
m_ex_yan_03_7,I suggest you stick
m_ex_yan_03_8,to your day job.
m_ex_yan_03_9,So what's troubling you?
m_ex_yan_03_10,"Oh, right."
m_ex_yan_03_11,Well...
m_ex_yan_03_12,Um...
m_ex_yan_03_13,What is it??
m_ex_yan_03_14,"It's just on the tip of my tongue,"
m_ex_yan_03_15,but I can't remember it
m_ex_yan_03_16,no thanks to that goofy joke of yours.
m_ex_yan_03_17,Hahaha.
m_ex_yan_03_18,It's not funny!
m_ex_yan_03_19,I'm really struggling here.
m_ex_yan_03_20,"Sorry, it's just that you're so cute when you're frustrated."
m_ex_yan_03_21,Ohhhh noooooooo! :'(
m_ex_yan_03_22,What's gotten
m_ex_yan_03_23,into you today?
m_ex_yan_03_24,... Did someone steal your phone?
m_ex_yan_03_25,Am I talking to someone else?
m_ex_yan_03_26,What's gotten into you today?
m_ex_yan_03_27,Are you making fun of me?
m_ex_yan_03_28,This is ridiculous.
m_ex_yan_03_29,I'll text you
m_ex_yan_03_30,if I remember what it was.
m_ex_yan_03_31,Okay.
m_ex_yulha_01_1,Are you
m_ex_yulha_01_2,the Commander
m_ex_yulha_01_3,who requested my support?
m_ex_yulha_01_4,??
m_ex_yulha_01_5,What are those question marks supposed to mean?
m_ex_yulha_01_6,"You called for me, didn't you?"
m_ex_yulha_01_7,"Yes, I did."
m_ex_yulha_01_8,Well then?
m_ex_yulha_01_9,How come you can't give me a straight answer?
m_ex_yulha_01_10,"My superiors are always stressing how I should take things seriously,"
m_ex_yulha_01_11,but I don't see the point in it.
m_ex_yulha_01_12,I'm sorry?
m_ex_yulha_01_13,What for?
m_ex_yulha_01_14,Who taught you to use question marks like that?
m_ex_yulha_01_15,"Listen,"
m_ex_yulha_01_16,"Newbie,"
m_ex_yulha_01_17,you mustn't apologize to Nikkes so profusely.
m_ex_yulha_01_18,"That is, never get on any Nikke's bad side."
m_ex_yulha_01_19,Raptures aren't the only way
m_ex_yulha_01_20,Commanders can perish.
m_ex_yulha_01_21,"If you're unable to keep a firm grasp on your Nikkes, like you're failing to now,"
m_ex_yulha_01_22,they can overtake you at any moment.
m_ex_yulha_01_23,They'll kill you
m_ex_yulha_01_24,the moment they have the opportunity.
m_ex_yulha_01_25,Thank you for your concern.
m_ex_yulha_01_26,Now you're thanking me?
m_ex_yulha_01_27,You really are a goodie-two-shoes.
m_ex_yulha_01_28,You need to toughen up.
m_ex_yulha_01_29,Get yourself together.
m_ex_yulha_01_30,Or you'll be done in by one Nikke or another.
m_ex_yulha_01_31,I'll be in your care from now on.
m_ex_yulha_01_32,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_yulha_01_33,You idiot.
m_ex_yulha_01_34,I told you don't to give a Nikke any kind of opening.
m_ex_yulha_01_35,Are you even listening?
m_ex_yulha_01_36,Now I see why you weigh so heavy on my superior's mind.
m_ex_yulha_01_37,All right.
m_ex_yulha_01_38,Fine.
m_ex_yulha_01_39,"You're under the spotlight, that much is certain."
m_ex_yulha_01_40,Let's just hope you the attention you get
m_ex_yulha_01_41,will end up being positive.
m_ex_yulha_01_42,That way we'll be able to
m_ex_yulha_01_43,collaborate properly.
m_ex_yulha_01_44,I'll keep that in mind.
m_ex_yulha_02_1,"Hey, Newbie,"
m_ex_yulha_02_2,I have a question.
m_ex_yulha_02_3,Just one?
m_ex_yulha_02_4,Do I have to answer?
m_ex_yulha_02_5,What are you talking about?
m_ex_yulha_02_6,Quit kidding around and listen.
m_ex_yulha_02_7,Okay.
m_ex_yulha_02_8,How do I talk nice to people?
m_ex_yulha_02_9,What is that?
m_ex_yulha_02_10,I'm asking you how should I
m_ex_yulha_02_11,talk to make myself sound more amiable?
m_ex_yulha_02_12,I don't think you can reduce it down to science...
m_ex_yulha_02_13,Do you think
m_ex_yulha_02_14,I don't know that already?
m_ex_yulha_02_15,What I mean is...
m_ex_yulha_02_16,you...
m_ex_yulha_02_17,Grrr...
m_ex_yulha_02_18,"I didn't plan on going into such detail,"
m_ex_yulha_02_19,but...
m_ex_yulha_02_20,"I heard you get along quite well when speaking with Privaty and Admi,"
m_ex_yulha_02_21,is that right?
m_ex_yulha_02_22,Maybe? I'm not sure.
m_ex_yulha_02_23,No need to be modest.
m_ex_yulha_02_24,I trust them.
m_ex_yulha_02_25,"Anyway, I ordered them to tell me about"
m_ex_yulha_02_26,what was on their mind.
m_ex_yulha_02_27,Privaty ended up mumbling something
m_ex_yulha_02_28,about how they couldn't tell me anything
m_ex_yulha_02_29,if I asked them so forcefully.
m_ex_yulha_02_30,Uh-huh...
m_ex_yulha_02_31,So I asked her what kind of tone I should use.
m_ex_yulha_02_32,"She said I should try and be more ""amiable"" when I talk."
m_ex_yulha_02_33,How ridiculous!
m_ex_yulha_02_34,"I'm already asking them what's on their mind, is that not good enough?"
m_ex_yulha_02_35,Now I have to be amicable as well?
m_ex_yulha_02_36,Just thinking about it
m_ex_yulha_02_37,gets me heated.
m_ex_yulha_02_38,Have they forgotten how many times I've had to clean up their mess?
m_ex_yulha_02_39,Who are they to tell me how to act?
m_ex_yulha_02_40,"After all I've done for them,"
m_ex_yulha_02_41,am I supposed to walk around smiling or something?
m_ex_yulha_02_42,Calm down.
m_ex_yulha_02_43,"Dammit, I quit."
m_ex_yulha_02_44,Why should I change my tone?
m_ex_yulha_02_45,Who has time for that crap?
m_ex_yulha_02_46,I'm already up to my neck at work.
m_ex_yulha_02_47,"The more I think about it, the madder I get."
m_ex_yulha_02_48,"Just forget about it, Newbie."
m_ex_yulha_02_49,Don't bother offering me any advice.
m_ex_yulha_02_50,Okay.
m_ex_yulha_02_51,Enough of this ridiculousness.
m_ex_yulha_02_52,No more chit-chat.
m_ex_yulha_02_53,Get back to work.
m_ex_yulha_03_1,Newqaie
m_ex_yulha_03_2,???
m_ex_yulha_03_3,"Newbie, are you listening??????"
m_ex_yulha_03_4,Is that Yulha?
m_ex_yulha_03_5,"Of course, who else?"
m_ex_yulha_03_6,"It's meeeea, Yullllha"
m_ex_yulha_03_7,How much have you drunk?
m_ex_yulha_03_8,Drank?
m_ex_yulha_03_9,Drank...
m_ex_yulha_03_10,Druuuuunk...
m_ex_yulha_03_11,Can't say
m_ex_yulha_03_12,that I remmber
m_ex_yulha_03_13,msut have slipped my mind?
m_ex_yulha_03_14,Neeeever miiind.
m_ex_yulha_03_15,Oh my poor borken heaaaarrrt.
m_ex_yulha_03_16,That conniviiinngg swwiiinnneeee
m_ex_yulha_03_17,is so annoying...
m_ex_yulha_03_18,Annoying.
m_ex_yulha_03_19,Deputy Chief or whoever
m_ex_yulha_03_20,asked me to do this and that.
m_ex_yulha_03_21,"He has had so many bones to pick today,"
m_ex_yulha_03_22,always bitching about this and ahat.
m_ex_yulha_03_23,"I tell you wat,"
m_ex_yulha_03_24,I'd love to punch him mrihgt in the face.
m_ex_yulha_03_25,Violence is never the answer.
m_ex_yulha_03_26,I know thatttt
m_ex_yulha_03_27,You idiotjl.
m_ex_yulha_03_28,That's why I'm so depressed.
m_ex_yulha_03_29,"Dammit, aaaaah!"
m_ex_yulha_03_30,Are you outside?
m_ex_yulha_03_31,What's it to you?
m_ex_yulha_03_32,You wouldn't want to drink me with meanyway.
m_ex_yulha_03_33,Go back to your dorm.
m_ex_yulha_03_34,Nooooope.
m_ex_yulha_03_35,I won't.
m_ex_yulha_03_36,I want to driiiiink more.
m_ex_yulha_03_37,I'll drink with you if you go back to your dorm.
m_ex_yulha_03_38,Really?
m_ex_yulha_03_39,Are you gonna driiiink with me?
m_ex_yulha_03_40,I'm on my way.
m_ex_yulha_03_41,I'm coooooming.
m_ex_yulha_03_42,...
m_ex_yulha_03_43,I need to visit Yulha's dorm later.
m_ex_noise_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_noise_01_2,I'm sure we'll get along just fine.
m_ex_noise_01_3,I'm sure we will.
m_ex_noise_01_4,There's no answer.
m_ex_noise_01_5,Sorry.
m_ex_noise_01_6,I was busy getting ready for a performance.
m_ex_noise_01_7,"I'm the opening act,"
m_ex_noise_01_8,so I had a lot to prepare. I'm really sorry.
m_ex_noise_01_9,It's okay.
m_ex_noise_01_10,Are you close to a TV by any chance?
m_ex_noise_01_11,Tetra Connect is gonna be broadcasting the performance live.
m_ex_noise_01_12,You can check it out if you like.
m_ex_noise_01_13,Are you a singer?
m_ex_noise_01_14,You mean you don't know?
m_ex_noise_01_15,Here I was thinking I was pretty famous.
m_ex_noise_01_16,"Have you heard the song ""Diva""?"
m_ex_noise_01_17,I think I've heard of it.
m_ex_noise_01_18,I'm not sure.
m_ex_noise_01_19,I'm not surprised.
m_ex_noise_01_20,You can't take two steps in the Ark without hearing it.
m_ex_noise_01_21,That's my song.
m_ex_noise_01_22,"Not only do I sing in it, but I've also written the lyrics and the music."
m_ex_noise_01_23,You're kidding!
m_ex_noise_01_24,Do you not have any interest at all in music?
m_ex_noise_01_25,You should give it a listen whenever you have time.
m_ex_noise_01_26,"The lyrics, the music, the singing...I did it all."
m_ex_noise_01_27,"To be fair though,"
m_ex_noise_01_28,it is my only song...
m_ex_noise_01_29,Why is that?
m_ex_noise_01_30,The show is going to start soon.
m_ex_noise_01_31,"Anyway, I look forward to working with you."
m_ex_noise_01_32,Mustang has told me a lot about you.
m_ex_noise_01_33,I'd like to get to know you better.
m_ex_noise_01_34,I'll come to visit you soon.
m_ex_noise_01_35,"See you then, Producer."
m_ex_noise_01_36,Producer?
m_ex_noise_01_37,... No answer.
m_ex_noise_02_1,"I was doing a show today,"
m_ex_noise_02_2,"when all of a sudden, a fan leaped onto the stage."
m_ex_noise_02_3,"I'd run that very situation over countless times in my head,"
m_ex_noise_02_4,going over how I'd respond.
m_ex_noise_02_5,"When it actually happened though, I blanked out."
m_ex_noise_02_6,Were you hurt?
m_ex_noise_02_7,What did they do after getting on stage?
m_ex_noise_02_8,"No, I'm okay."
m_ex_noise_02_9,I wasn't in any danger to begin with.
m_ex_noise_02_10,"He'd had a few too many,"
m_ex_noise_02_11,"and he's such a big fan of my music,"
m_ex_noise_02_12,he just wanted to dance on stage.
m_ex_noise_02_13,So that's what we did.
m_ex_noise_02_14,Must have been fun.
m_ex_noise_02_15,Must have been awkward.
m_ex_noise_02_16,Fun and awkward.
m_ex_noise_02_17,A little bit of both.
m_ex_noise_02_18,I was also jealous.
m_ex_noise_02_19,Jealous?
m_ex_noise_02_20,It's not easy to just let your body go
m_ex_noise_02_21,and give in to the music without caring what other people think.
m_ex_noise_02_22,I'm sure you can agree with me on that.
m_ex_noise_02_23,Absolutely. It's very hard.
m_ex_noise_02_24,"Anyway,"
m_ex_noise_02_25,nowadays the media covers every single move you make.
m_ex_noise_02_26,I'm always reluctant to really let myself go.
m_ex_noise_02_27,Tonight felt so different.
m_ex_noise_02_28,I need to learn how to just go with the flow more often.
m_ex_noise_02_29,You and I can work on it together.
m_ex_noise_02_30,Sounds like a plan.
m_ex_noise_02_31,"All right then, see you later."
m_ex_noise_03_1,No!
m_ex_noise_03_2,I lost!
m_ex_noise_03_3,What are you talking about?
m_ex_noise_03_4,"I dropped to 2nd place on the charts yesterday,"
m_ex_noise_03_5,and today I'm in 3rd.
m_ex_noise_03_6,Releasing two new songs at once was a dirty move.
m_ex_noise_03_7,Who ousted you?
m_ex_noise_03_8,Who do you think?
m_ex_noise_03_9,Volume.
m_ex_noise_03_10,"I have to admit, her songs are really good."
m_ex_noise_03_11,But I want to be on top!
m_ex_noise_03_12,"It's hard now though, what with modern tastes."
m_ex_noise_03_13,"Hip-hop is all the rage now,"
m_ex_noise_03_14,so that's what listeners flock to.
m_ex_noise_03_15,Isn't there a pop music audition program too?
m_ex_noise_03_16,"Yeah, but it's ending next week."
m_ex_noise_03_17,The production director on the show got caught being lobbied
m_ex_noise_03_18,There's going to be a news article either today or tomorrow.
m_ex_noise_03_19,So that won't be of any help.
m_ex_noise_03_20,Looks like luck just isn't on your side.
m_ex_noise_03_21,Tell me about it.
m_ex_noise_03_22,"I was the top dog plenty of times before,"
m_ex_noise_03_23,just not anymore.
m_ex_noise_03_24,But I still want to be number one.
m_ex_noise_03_25,Wait.
m_ex_noise_03_26,Volume is calling me.
m_ex_noise_03_27,Probably gonna just toot her own horn.
m_ex_noise_03_28,I'll see you later.
m_ex_volume_01_1,Hi there!
m_ex_volume_01_2,Hello.
m_ex_volume_01_3,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_volume_01_4,"Quick response, I like it!"
m_ex_volume_01_5,"What's with all the formality? Loosen up, will ya?"
m_ex_volume_01_6,I assume there's no need to introduce myself.
m_ex_volume_01_7,"If you don't know me, you've been living under a rock."
m_ex_volume_01_8,I see you on the news quite often.
m_ex_volume_01_9,Huh?
m_ex_volume_01_10,The news?
m_ex_volume_01_11,What about on stage?
m_ex_volume_01_12,Erm...
m_ex_volume_01_13,Have you ever seen me perform?
m_ex_volume_01_14,Not yet.
m_ex_volume_01_15,You're kidding!
m_ex_volume_01_16,How is that even possible?
m_ex_volume_01_17,Let me ask you something. Are you one of my fans?
m_ex_volume_01_18,I am.
m_ex_volume_01_19,"No, I'm not."
m_ex_volume_01_20,What?
m_ex_volume_01_21,You haven't even seen a single show of mine.
m_ex_volume_01_22,How can you call yourself a fan?
m_ex_volume_01_23,"Wha... but if not me, then who?"
m_ex_volume_01_24,Noise? Aria?
m_ex_volume_01_25,"Either way, talk about a blow to my pride..."
m_ex_volume_01_26,I'll send you a ticket to my concert soon.
m_ex_volume_01_27,"Be there, or be square."
m_ex_volume_01_28,I'll put on a show you'll never forget.
m_ex_volume_01_29,Deal.
m_ex_volume_02_1,Hahaha.
m_ex_volume_02_2,Hahahahahahahahahahahaha.
m_ex_volume_02_3,Why are you laughing?
m_ex_volume_02_4,Cause I'm so happy!
m_ex_volume_02_5,Did you see the music charts?
m_ex_volume_02_6,Not yet.
m_ex_volume_02_7,Do you even realize how many weeks I've been at the top?
m_ex_volume_02_8,"Number one for eight weeks running, baby!"
m_ex_volume_02_9,Is that good?
m_ex_volume_02_10,...
m_ex_volume_02_11,All right.
m_ex_volume_02_12,About 50 songs get made per week.
m_ex_volume_02_13,You do the math.
m_ex_volume_02_14,Wow.
m_ex_volume_02_15,Isn't it amazing?
m_ex_volume_02_16,"Amongst all those songs,"
m_ex_volume_02_17,I'm at the top of the heap.
m_ex_volume_02_18,Not even Noise could pull that off.
m_ex_volume_02_19,My music is the most popular around.
m_ex_volume_02_20,"Now, do you see how amazing my music is?"
m_ex_volume_02_21,"If I'm being honest, this song is a masterpiece."
m_ex_volume_02_22,"Although I'm sure you haven't heard it yet, right?"
m_ex_volume_02_23,I'll listen to it right now.
m_ex_volume_02_24,I've heard it.
m_ex_volume_02_25,Are you kidding me? It's already been out for...
m_ex_volume_02_26,What did you think?
m_ex_volume_02_27,Erm...
m_ex_volume_02_28,Hey! Be honest! Have you really listened to my music before?
m_ex_volume_02_29,... Sorry.
m_ex_volume_02_30,"What kind of a lousy manager are you, anyway?"
m_ex_volume_02_31,I ought to fire you right here and now.
m_ex_volume_02_32,Make sure you listen to all my albums by tomorrow.
m_ex_volume_02_33,"Every single one, from my debut until now. Is that clear?"
m_ex_volume_02_34,Crystal.
m_ex_volume_03_1,"Hey, I'm thinking about writing a new song."
m_ex_volume_03_2,Throw me some ideas.
m_ex_volume_03_3,An R&B slow jam about love.
m_ex_volume_03_4,A trap song about breaking up.
m_ex_volume_03_5,"A love song, eh?"
m_ex_volume_03_6,"Not really in my wheelhouse,"
m_ex_volume_03_7,but it could be fun to give a try.
m_ex_volume_03_8,I've never done a song about love.
m_ex_volume_03_9,"I don't know, I may get too worked up writing about that."
m_ex_volume_03_10,I can't get too explicit with my song lyrics.
m_ex_volume_03_11,"If you ask me, there's no such thing as a mutual break-up."
m_ex_volume_03_12,But even a tumultuous break-up has a certain charm to it.
m_ex_volume_03_13,"Okay, a beat is coming to my mind."
m_ex_volume_03_14,It'd be good if I had someone do a feature. Who fits the bill?
m_ex_volume_03_15,Noise.
m_ex_volume_03_16,Aria.
m_ex_volume_03_17,"Yeah, Noise could work."
m_ex_volume_03_18,"That way, her fans would listen to my music too."
m_ex_volume_03_19,Huh? Can you imagine how I'd look performing in an opera house?
m_ex_volume_03_20,I better get started while it's still fresh in my mind.
m_ex_volume_03_21,Can't wait to hear what you come up with.
m_ex_volume_03_22,"Trust me, it's gonna be worth the wait."
m_ex_volume_03_23,My music never disappoints.
m_ex_volume_03_24,You may not be entirely worthless after all.
m_ex_volume_03_25,Clear my schedule for the day.
m_ex_volume_03_26,I want to spend every minute focusing on this song.
m_ex_volume_03_27,"Once I've got a beat down, you'll be the first to hear it."
m_ex_volume_03_28,"Just so you know, I don't accept any criticism."
m_ex_volume_03_29,Because my beats are perfect.
m_ex_volume_03_30,See you later.
m_ex_aria_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_aria_01_2,It's nice to meet you.
m_ex_aria_01_3,Do I need to introduce myself?
m_ex_aria_01_4,Are you Aria?
m_ex_aria_01_5,Are you the popular opera singer?
m_ex_aria_01_6,That's me.
m_ex_aria_01_7,I'm glad to see you recognized me!
m_ex_aria_01_8,Have you had a chance to catch any of my performances?
m_ex_aria_01_9,I'm afraid not.
m_ex_aria_01_10,That's fine.
m_ex_aria_01_11,"Our relationship won't be based on artistry,"
m_ex_aria_01_12,nor will it be terribly romantic.
m_ex_aria_01_13,"Nevertheless, it'll be quite similar to putting on a big show."
m_ex_aria_01_14,"On that note, I'd like to give you tickets to Castle of Parma as a gift."
m_ex_aria_01_15,ticket.rropera.com/MobileTicket493S0A67F5
m_ex_aria_01_16,Weren't tickets sold out?
m_ex_aria_01_17,Thank you.
m_ex_aria_01_18,That's right.
m_ex_aria_01_19,"However, they always reserve a few seats for friends and family of the cast."
m_ex_aria_01_20,No problem.
m_ex_aria_01_21,"If you want to get to know me,"
m_ex_aria_01_22,seeing me on stage will do more good than hours of conversation.
m_ex_aria_01_23,You might be able to get a sense of how to interact with me.
m_ex_aria_01_24,"So long, then."
m_ex_aria_01_25,The intermission is about to end.
m_ex_aria_01_26,Good luck with the rest of the performance.
m_ex_aria_01_27,Thanks.
m_ex_aria_01_28,"I hope the rest of your day goes well,"
m_ex_aria_01_29,{AccountData.NickName}
m_ex_aria_02_1,"{AccountData.NickName},"
m_ex_aria_02_2,someone sent flowers to my dressing room.
m_ex_aria_02_3,Was it you?
m_ex_aria_02_4,?? No.
m_ex_aria_02_5,Really? That's strange...
m_ex_aria_02_6,The staff said the person who sent the flowers
m_ex_aria_02_7,looked a lot like you.
m_ex_aria_02_8,But none of my friends look like you at all.
m_ex_aria_02_9,"I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed."
m_ex_aria_02_10,I was kind of hoping it would be you.
m_ex_aria_02_11,"Sorry, maybe next time."
m_ex_aria_02_12,I'll send you a different present instead.
m_ex_aria_02_13,It's okay.
m_ex_aria_02_14,I know you're busy.
m_ex_aria_02_15,"I realize my performance isn't the most important thing,"
m_ex_aria_02_16,and that it'd be unreasonable to be upset.
m_ex_aria_02_17,It's okay.
m_ex_aria_02_18,"I know it's a busy time for you,"
m_ex_aria_02_19,so I don't want to add any more pressure.
m_ex_aria_02_20,"But since it came up, I'll let you know in advance"
m_ex_aria_02_21,that my next performance will be the opera Lake's Sword.
m_ex_aria_02_22,Same location as before: the Opera House on Royal Road.
m_ex_aria_02_23,The first performance will be on the 5th of next month.
m_ex_aria_02_24,"If you can come in-person to see the show,"
m_ex_aria_02_25,will you send me flowers?
m_ex_aria_02_26,Of course.
m_ex_aria_02_27,Thank you.
m_ex_aria_02_28,Now I have something to look forward to.
m_ex_aria_02_29,I've got to go attend an after-party.
m_ex_aria_02_30,Let's talk again soon.
m_ex_aria_02_31,Have fun.
m_ex_aria_03_1,"Maestro,"
m_ex_aria_03_2,do you know what Tetranet is by any chance?
m_ex_aria_03_3,Everyone is familiar with Tetranet.
m_ex_aria_03_4,It's a video-sharing platform.
m_ex_aria_03_5,Aria doesn't respond for a long time.
m_ex_aria_03_6,You shouldn't look down on anyone
m_ex_aria_03_7,just because they don't know something.
m_ex_aria_03_8,I wasn't judging anyone.
m_ex_aria_03_9,Good.
m_ex_aria_03_10,You knew too?
m_ex_aria_03_11,I feel so out of the loop.
m_ex_aria_03_12,Anyone living in the digital age knows about Tetranet.
m_ex_aria_03_13,I didn't...
m_ex_aria_03_14,"... Well, there are always exceptions to the rule."
m_ex_aria_03_15,Good save.
m_ex_aria_03_16,"A while back, my troupe tried to get me"
m_ex_aria_03_17,to set up my own official Tetranet channel.
m_ex_aria_03_18,Neither the opera house nor I
m_ex_aria_03_19,am sure if that's really necessary.
m_ex_aria_03_20,It's a good idea to have an official channel.
m_ex_aria_03_21,Why's that?
m_ex_aria_03_22,You can make money from advertising fees.
m_ex_aria_03_23,It helps you get your name out there.
m_ex_aria_03_24,"I'm not disagreeing with you,"
m_ex_aria_03_25,"but if I post videos on there,"
m_ex_aria_03_26,what reason would people have to come to the opera house?
m_ex_aria_03_27,There are already plenty of videos on the internet.
m_ex_aria_03_28,Seeing a video clip of you performing and seeing you in real life are two different things.
m_ex_aria_03_29,"Yet again, I agree with you."
m_ex_aria_03_30,But you can't deny that there are people
m_ex_aria_03_31,who would have come to see me in concert
m_ex_aria_03_32,if it weren't for the fact there were free videos online.
m_ex_aria_03_33,"You know there are already hundreds of videos of you online, right?"
m_ex_aria_03_34,There are?
m_ex_aria_03_35,"Of course, but fans are still coming to see you."
m_ex_aria_03_36,Aria doesn't answer for a long time.
m_ex_aria_03_37,I just searched my name on Tetranet...
m_ex_aria_03_38,You're right.
m_ex_aria_03_39,"I've scrolled through 100 pages, and videos keep popping up."
m_ex_aria_03_40,"People can listen to my singing online so easily,"
m_ex_aria_03_41,but my concert tickets still sell out so quickly...
m_ex_aria_03_42,That's right.
m_ex_aria_03_43,Hmm...
m_ex_aria_03_44,I can't believe this.
m_ex_aria_03_45,I guess I underestimated my fans.
m_ex_aria_03_46,Thanks for hearing me out.
m_ex_aria_03_47,I'll get started on setting up my own official channel.
m_ex_aria_03_48,I'll be your first subscriber.
m_ex_primadonna_01_1,What's everybody up to?
m_ex_primadonna_01_2,Just chillin'
m_ex_primadonna_01_3,No one else responds.
m_ex_primadonna_01_4,I'm making a beat.
m_ex_primadonna_01_5,What kind of beat?
m_ex_primadonna_01_6,I'm practicing for my new role.
m_ex_primadonna_01_7,Who are you playing?
m_ex_primadonna_01_8,"Again, no answer for hours."
m_ex_primadonna_01_9,"Phew, all that beat-making tuckered me out."
m_ex_primadonna_01_10,"I could go for a nice, ice-cold..."
m_ex_primadonna_01_11,Ice cold what?
m_ex_primadonna_01_12,"Once again, silence."
m_ex_primadonna_01_13,I got an iced Americano.
m_ex_primadonna_01_14,Too bitter for my taste.
m_ex_primadonna_01_15,I don't have time to eat anything
m_ex_primadonna_01_16,:p
m_ex_primadonna_01_17,Hey.
m_ex_primadonna_01_18,Hey what?
m_ex_primadonna_01_19,... Ah.
m_ex_primadonna_01_20,"Oh, right."
m_ex_primadonna_01_21,"I've got a killer show coming up, you all better be there."
m_ex_primadonna_01_22,"Sure, I'll check it out."
m_ex_primadonna_01_23,I'll go as long as it doesn't overlap with my practice time.
m_ex_primadonna_01_24,Sweet :D
m_ex_primadonna_01_25,I'll go too!
m_ex_primadonna_01_26,"Although I'd like to go as well, there's no answer."
m_ex_primadonna_01_27,Guess everyone's busy.
m_ex_primadonna_01_28,"After that, there were no more replies from anyone."
m_ex_primadonna_02_1,"Hey guys, I need your help with these lyrics."
m_ex_primadonna_02_2,I'm making a response diss track attacking the Freaks.
m_ex_primadonna_02_3,"Give me the juice, and I'll put it to use."
m_ex_primadonna_02_4,"Whoa, you rhymed just now!"
m_ex_primadonna_02_5,How about using that as a lyric?
m_ex_primadonna_02_6,I don't know.
m_ex_primadonna_02_7,Isn't it a bit blunt?
m_ex_primadonna_02_8,I feel like art should be more poetic.
m_ex_primadonna_02_9,I'm with Aria on this one.
m_ex_primadonna_02_10,You're crazy. Everything Volume touches is art.
m_ex_primadonna_02_11,You guys should know
m_ex_primadonna_02_12,how dangerous it is to bring up art
m_ex_primadonna_02_13,in front of volume :/
m_ex_primadonna_02_14,It's like poking at an angry bear.
m_ex_primadonna_02_15,Manager...
m_ex_primadonna_02_16,"Did you just side with Aria? You're gonna preach to me what ""art"" is?"
m_ex_primadonna_02_17,Hmm...
m_ex_primadonna_02_18,I don't think it's smart to
m_ex_primadonna_02_19,compare Aria and Volume.
m_ex_primadonna_02_20,"It's both arts, just different categories."
m_ex_primadonna_02_21,"You're probably on thin ice with Volume now, hehe."
m_ex_primadonna_02_22,Manager...
m_ex_primadonna_02_23,are you really putting Aria and me in the same category? Seriously?
m_ex_primadonna_02_24,"Hehe, yep."
m_ex_primadonna_02_25,Pretty much the reaction I expected.
m_ex_primadonna_02_26,How exciting!
m_ex_primadonna_02_27,"Sorry, I messed up."
m_ex_primadonna_02_28,Don't egg them on!
m_ex_primadonna_02_29,Too late now.
m_ex_primadonna_02_30,This showdown was bound to
m_ex_primadonna_02_31,happen one day.
m_ex_primadonna_02_32,"Aria,"
m_ex_primadonna_02_33,let's see who can make the more popular song.
m_ex_primadonna_02_34,That's not a bad idea.
m_ex_primadonna_02_35,Any recommendations for what the song should be about?
m_ex_primadonna_02_36,You bet I do.
m_ex_primadonna_02_37,This whack MC has been doggin' me nonstop.
m_ex_primadonna_02_38,He's created multiple accounts on the rapper forums.
m_ex_primadonna_02_39,What would you do if you were me?
m_ex_primadonna_02_40,"First things first. Aria, since you don't know anything about rap, I'll show you an example"
m_ex_primadonna_02_41,Volume seems to be coming up with lyrics on the fly.
m_ex_primadonna_02_42,Your rhymes are as lame are your personality.
m_ex_primadonna_02_43,"Trying to act tough behind the keyboard, my grandma has more swag than your sorry ass."
m_ex_primadonna_02_44,"All the fans have the same IP, it doesn't make sense like irony."
m_ex_primadonna_02_45,Hearing Volume freestyle gets the blood pumping.
m_ex_primadonna_02_46,It's a searing diss track.
m_ex_primadonna_02_47,There you have it.
m_ex_primadonna_02_48,I think I've got the hang of it.
m_ex_primadonna_02_49,Can I have a try?
m_ex_primadonna_02_50,Go ahead.
m_ex_primadonna_02_51,Aria is also typing up lyrics on the fly.
m_ex_primadonna_02_52,My heart is filled with fiery vengeance!
m_ex_primadonna_02_53,I will not rest.
m_ex_primadonna_02_54,Not until my enemy is dead and buried.
m_ex_primadonna_02_55,Only the sweet taste of their demise will bring me solace.
m_ex_primadonna_02_56,Go back to hell whence you came!
m_ex_primadonna_02_57,"There you shall suffer for all eternity, cast out in perpetuity."
m_ex_primadonna_02_58,Forever torn asunder!
m_ex_primadonna_02_59,... Yikes.
m_ex_primadonna_02_60,Are those lyrics written from Volume's perspective?
m_ex_primadonna_02_61,That's right!
m_ex_primadonna_02_62,"Rather than writing lyrics that insult her opponent directly,"
m_ex_primadonna_02_63,I thought it would be more artistic to write lyrics
m_ex_primadonna_02_64,about the lust for vengeance inside Volume.
m_ex_primadonna_02_65,You call that rap?! What garbage!
m_ex_primadonna_02_66,"FYI, you could also use 'detritus'."
m_ex_primadonna_02_67,The best way to push someone's buttons
m_ex_primadonna_02_68,is to best them using a more varied vernacular.
m_ex_primadonna_02_69,You know nothing!
m_ex_primadonna_02_70,Get out of here with your absurd lyrics about revenge.
m_ex_primadonna_02_71,"Come now ladies, let's not fight."
m_ex_primadonna_02_72,"Producer,"
m_ex_primadonna_02_73,"once they get started, there's no separating them."
m_ex_primadonna_02_74,It's best just to leave them to it.
m_ex_primadonna_02_75,:(
m_ex_primadonna_02_76,"Just as I thought, I don't see the appeal in your music."
m_ex_primadonna_02_77,Of course you don't.
m_ex_primadonna_02_78,That's because I actually have talent.
m_ex_primadonna_02_79,I decided to turn off blabla for a while.
m_mainafter_01_01_1,Is the Commander in the group yet?
m_mainafter_01_01_2,"Commander, say something."
m_mainafter_01_01_3,What is this?
m_mainafter_01_01_4,Yes!
m_mainafter_01_01_5,The Commander has joined our group chat!
m_mainafter_01_01_6,Finally.
m_mainafter_01_01_7,What is this about?
m_mainafter_01_01_8,This is the blabla group chat for the Counters.
m_mainafter_01_01_9,"As long as it's not an emergency, you can use this to issue any orders you have."
m_mainafter_01_01_10,"And we can just chit-chat as well, heehee!"
m_mainafter_01_01_11,"Anyway, it's nice to be working with you,"
m_mainafter_01_01_12,though I don't know how long it'll end up being.
m_mainafter_01_01_13,I'm sure we'll get along just fine.
m_mainafter_01_01_14,I suppose that depends on your attitude.
m_mainafter_01_01_15,Sure!
m_mainafter_01_01_16,I think so too!
m_mainafter_01_01_17,Huh?
m_mainafter_01_01_18,"So if I don't follow orders, you'll kick me to the curb, is that it?"
m_mainafter_01_01_19,Anis!
m_mainafter_01_01_20,I'm just joking!
m_mainafter_01_01_21,"By the way, what's up with our squad being called Counters?"
m_mainafter_01_01_22,"I mean, it's certainly better than Squad 04-F, but what gives?"
m_mainafter_01_01_23,I'm sure there's a perfectly valid reason for it.
m_mainafter_01_01_24,"And in the future, try being a little more tactful when asking questions."
m_mainafter_01_01_25,"All right, all right."
m_mainafter_01_01_26,"Anyway, let's all do our best"
m_mainafter_01_01_27,to work together!
m_mainafter_02_01_1,Neon has joined the group.
m_mainafter_02_01_2,Is this the right group chat?
m_mainafter_02_01_3,"Counters, right?"
m_mainafter_02_01_4,Let me introduce myself.
m_mainafter_02_01_5,"I am the Goddess of Firepower,"
m_mainafter_02_01_6,the firepower incarnate.
m_mainafter_02_01_7,Gunpowder courses through my very veins.
m_mainafter_02_01_8,...
m_mainafter_02_01_9,"Hey,"
m_mainafter_02_01_10,is anybody in here?
m_mainafter_02_01_11,I was just about
m_mainafter_02_01_12,to apologize to the Commander for slapping them in the face before.
m_mainafter_02_01_13,But your sudden appearance and strange words interrupted me.
m_mainafter_02_01_14,My face still feels numb.
m_mainafter_02_01_15,Never mind. I deserved it.
m_mainafter_02_01_16,I saw it! You slapped with your weight.
m_mainafter_02_01_17,What are you taking abo
m_mainafter_02_01_18,What are you talking about?
m_mainafter_02_01_19,Hahaha!
m_mainafter_02_01_20,Is that your apology?
m_mainafter_02_01_21,"Oh, geez."
m_mainafter_02_01_22,That's true.
m_mainafter_02_01_23,The most common cause of Nikkes' death
m_mainafter_02_01_24,"is poor command. At least, that's what I've heard."
m_mainafter_02_01_25,"Of course, I've no doubt that Master will overcome it right away."
m_mainafter_02_01_26,So I didn't move. But I didn't expect that Anis couldn't help herself.
m_mainafter_02_01_27,"Hey, mind your words."
m_mainafter_02_01_28,Is Rapi okay?
m_mainafter_02_01_29,Mm-hmm.
m_mainafter_02_01_30,I think she's fine.
m_mainafter_02_01_31,I also had several similar experiences.
m_mainafter_02_01_32,Of being slapped in the face?
m_mainafter_02_01_33,"Don't mention that again, okay?"
m_mainafter_02_01_34,Stay where you are.
m_mainafter_02_01_35,I'll be back safe and sound.
m_mainafter_02_01_36,Okay.
m_mainafter_02_02_1,"Commander,"
m_mainafter_02_02_2,are you really okay?
m_mainafter_02_02_3,You don't look like you're ready for battle.
m_mainafter_02_02_4,Physically okay.
m_mainafter_02_02_5,But emotionally...
m_mainafter_02_02_6,"If I were you, I wouldn't have been in the mood to work outside."
m_mainafter_02_02_7,"I think Commander can still perform their duty well after being hit, right?"
m_mainafter_02_02_8,Don't mention slapping or hitting again.
m_mainafter_02_02_9,"Fine, my apologies."
m_mainafter_02_02_10,You have a point.
m_mainafter_02_02_11,"Commander, can you perform the task?"
m_mainafter_02_02_12,"Yes, I can."
m_mainafter_02_02_13,I have to.
m_mainafter_02_02_14,"Oh,"
m_mainafter_02_02_15,that's great!
m_mainafter_02_02_16,It must be hard for you.
m_mainafter_02_02_17,Would you like me to uplift your mood?
m_mainafter_02_02_18,With what?
m_mainafter_02_02_19,With a slap in Anis' face.
m_mainafter_02_02_20,"Oh, I'm sorry. I just said I won't mention it again."
m_mainafter_02_02_21,:|
m_mainafter_02_02_22,I don't think it would be a hard battle.
m_mainafter_02_02_23,I suggest finishing it soon so that we can have a good rest after that.
m_mainafter_02_02_24,My thoughts exactly.
m_mainafter_02_02_25,"Okay, let's finish it quick."
m_mainafter_04_01_1,Why is Syuen so hell-bent
m_mainafter_04_01_2,on finding Chatterbox anyway?
m_mainafter_04_01_3,It doesn't make any sense.
m_mainafter_04_01_4,Maybe she wants to use Chatterbox as a reference for new Nikke designs?
m_mainafter_04_01_5,"No, I don't think so."
m_mainafter_04_01_6,It's been proven that Rapture technology is incompatible with Nikkes.
m_mainafter_04_01_7,"Well, now I'm really curious."
m_mainafter_04_01_8,...
m_mainafter_04_01_9,You look like you know something.
m_mainafter_04_01_10,She probably considers it a notch in her belt.
m_mainafter_04_01_11,A what in her what?
m_mainafter_04_01_12,Missilis has always been the largest of the Big Three.
m_mainafter_04_01_13,"However, compared to her predecessor, the company has been somewhat scaled back since Syuen took over."
m_mainafter_04_01_14,"Meanwhile, Elysion and Tetra Line have continued making new advances and closing the gap between them and Missilis."
m_mainafter_04_01_15,"In other words, Syuen is resting on her laurels."
m_mainafter_04_01_16,Now I get it.
m_mainafter_04_01_17,Syuen wants to prove herself.
m_mainafter_04_01_18,You think that's why she treats us and the Nikkes from Wardress the way she does?
m_mainafter_04_01_19,Most likely.
m_mainafter_04_01_20,Shouldn't she just focus more on Nikke R&D?
m_mainafter_04_01_21,Why send a team she's not familiar with up to the surface?
m_mainafter_04_01_22,Every organization in the Ark is vying for all the currently existing resources.
m_mainafter_04_01_23,"Sooner or later, that competition will inevitably extend to the surface."
m_mainafter_04_01_24,How should I put this...
m_mainafter_04_01_25,I feel like Syuen is rushing into things.
m_mainafter_04_01_26,"As far as I know,"
m_mainafter_04_01_27,she's a genius who's adept at developing all sorts of new technologies.
m_mainafter_04_01_28,She's also loaded.
m_mainafter_04_01_29,"Sure, but running a company is an entirely different beast."
m_mainafter_04_01_30,Let's wait and see how this unfolds.
m_mainafter_04_01_31,Okay.
m_mainafter_04_01_32,"After all, it's not like we have anything else to do right now."
m_mainafter_07_01_1,"Hey,"
m_mainafter_07_01_2,did you know that Heretic?
m_mainafter_07_01_3,"Yup, sure do."
m_mainafter_07_01_4,Master?
m_mainafter_07_01_5,I do too.
m_mainafter_07_01_6,"Whoa,"
m_mainafter_07_01_7,I heard that she's a Rapture spy. So cool!
m_mainafter_07_01_8,"Kinda makes me feel inferior, just spying for a puny little megacorporation!"
m_mainafter_07_01_9,I'm sure you'll get there one day.
m_mainafter_07_01_10,"Ha, thanks!"
m_mainafter_07_01_11,But I'm not actually being serious.
m_mainafter_07_01_12,"Anyway, did you actually work with her before?"
m_mainafter_07_01_13,"Yes, we once fought together on the same side."
m_mainafter_07_01_14,Did something happen during that battle?
m_mainafter_07_01_15,Yes.
m_mainafter_07_01_16,"I never thought I would see her again, and certainly not like this..."
m_mainafter_07_01_17,I saw her head...
m_mainafter_07_01_18,Anyway...
m_mainafter_07_01_19,Now's not the right time to talk about this.
m_mainafter_07_01_20,The chances of a Nikke becoming a Heretic are incredibly minute.
m_mainafter_07_01_21,Marian seems to be one of those few cases.
m_mainafter_07_01_22,"But somehow, it seemed like she recognized Master."
m_mainafter_07_01_23,So does she still have a chance?
m_mainafter_07_01_24,What do you mean?
m_mainafter_07_01_25,A chance to start over.
m_mainafter_07_01_26,Stop dreaming.
m_mainafter_07_01_27,"Once you become a Heretic, there's no going back."
m_mainafter_07_01_28,"After you turn, your memories are gone for good."
m_mainafter_07_01_29,How horrible...
m_mainafter_07_01_30,In any case...
m_mainafter_07_01_31,There has to be a way to bring her back.
m_mainafter_07_01_32,But how?
m_mainafter_07_01_33,I'll do some digging.
m_mainafter_07_01_34,Let me help you.
m_mainafter_07_01_35,Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
m_mainafter_07_01_36,That's very kind of you.
m_mainafter_07_01_37,"If you ever come up with a plan, let me know."
m_mainafter_07_01_38,I'll be ready.
m_mainafter_07_01_39,I will.
m_mainafter_07_02_1,Rabbity!
m_mainafter_07_02_2,Did you get home safe?
m_mainafter_07_02_3,Yes.
m_mainafter_07_02_4,:D
m_mainafter_07_02_5,Are you coming tonight
m_mainafter_07_02_6,or tomorrow?
m_mainafter_07_02_7,"Wait, are you already on the way?"
m_mainafter_07_02_8,Actually...
m_mainafter_07_02_9,"Alice,"
m_mainafter_07_02_10,can't you tell when someone is busy?
m_mainafter_07_02_11,How could Servant make it here on such short notice?
m_mainafter_07_02_12,Oh... then when can Rabbity come over?
m_mainafter_07_02_13,I'm not sure.
m_mainafter_07_02_14,Depends on how much work there's left to do.
m_mainafter_07_02_15,"In that case,"
m_mainafter_07_02_16,"I'll cheer you on, Rabbity!"
m_mainafter_07_02_17,:)
m_mainafter_07_02_18,:>
m_mainafter_07_02_19,:D
m_mainafter_07_02_20,Well?
m_mainafter_07_02_21,Are you feeling more energetic now?
m_mainafter_07_02_22,＼(^^) /
m_mainafter_07_02_23,"What is this, emoji witchcraft?"
m_mainafter_07_02_24,"Wow, looks like it worked!"
m_mainafter_07_02_25,Hey!
m_mainafter_07_02_26,Are you calling me a witch?!
m_mainafter_07_02_27,Never mind. I feel good now.
m_mainafter_07_02_28,"Keep at it then,"
m_mainafter_07_02_29,and come here once you're finished with everything.
m_mainafter_07_02_30,I'll be waiting for you.
m_mainafter_07_02_31,"Anyway, I think I'll have to stop here."
m_mainafter_07_02_32,"My phone has held up great,"
m_mainafter_07_02_33,but it's starting to smoke.
m_mainafter_07_02_34,"Get here soon, Rabbity!"
m_mainafter_07_02_35,Roger that.
m_mainafter_09_01_1,"Commander,"
m_mainafter_09_01_2,"if you go with your gut just because you set up Commando,"
m_mainafter_09_01_3,none of us can guarantee your safety.
m_mainafter_09_01_4,Bear that in mind.
m_mainafter_09_01_5,What is that?
m_mainafter_09_01_6,What are you doing?
m_mainafter_09_01_7,I'm offering advice.
m_mainafter_09_01_8,Leave them alone.
m_mainafter_09_01_9,"They have never accepted your advice, have they?"
m_mainafter_09_01_10,My thoughts exactly.
m_mainafter_09_01_11,It's good enough if Privaty doesn't go with them.
m_mainafter_09_01_12,"Hey, you guys,"
m_mainafter_09_01_13,what are you talking about?
m_mainafter_09_01_14,Privaty.
m_mainafter_09_01_15,What?
m_mainafter_09_01_16,Do you want to join Commando?
m_mainafter_09_01_17,Would you like to go out with me?
m_mainafter_09_01_18,Huh?
m_mainafter_09_01_19,Right now?
m_mainafter_09_01_20,I have work about Triangle to do.
m_mainafter_09_01_21,It seems a little bit difficult...
m_mainafter_09_01_22,Darn.
m_mainafter_09_01_23,*Sigh*
m_mainafter_09_01_24,Huh...
m_mainafter_09_01_25,?
m_mainafter_09_01_26,"I mean, why?"
m_mainafter_09_01_27,I haven't said yes.
m_mainafter_09_01_28,What a trick!
m_mainafter_09_01_29,(Tsk)
m_mainafter_09_01_30,Anyway!!
m_mainafter_09_01_31,You must pay attention!!
m_mainafter_09_01_32,Hmm...
m_mainafter_09_01_33,"I know you won't listen no matter what we say,"
m_mainafter_09_01_34,"but remember one thing, a lot of people are watching you."
m_mainafter_09_01_35,"I'm not asking you to treat everyone as an enemy,"
m_mainafter_09_01_36,but you need to be on your guard at all times
m_mainafter_09_01_37,I didn't expect that Yulha would one day be so much nicer.
m_mainafter_09_01_38,You're annoying.
m_mainafter_09_01_39,"After all, Newbie always leaves us worried."
m_mainafter_09_01_40,"Indeed, in every sense."
m_mainafter_09_01_41,"Then, Commander,"
m_mainafter_09_01_42,talk to you later on blabla.
m_mainafter_09_01_43,Thank you all.
m_mainafter_09_01_44,Hmph!
m_mainafter_09_02_1,I didn't expect you to say that at that time.
m_mainafter_09_02_2,Wasn't it too early to say?
m_mainafter_09_02_3,Nope.
m_mainafter_09_02_4,They would find out soon even if I didn't say anything.
m_mainafter_09_02_5,"As long as someone sensed the unusuality and watched carefully,
my trick would be discovered immediately."
m_mainafter_09_02_6,"I thought you would never let anything slip, Rapi."
m_mainafter_09_02_7,"Me, too.
But things are not like this for the observer."
m_mainafter_09_02_8,"Even though I paid much attention, my unconscious habits would still betray me."
m_mainafter_09_02_9,But it paid off for us to say it before we got caught.
m_mainafter_09_02_10,Good timing.
m_mainafter_09_02_11,"But still, you should have let Commander know."
m_mainafter_09_02_12,Then I would have definitely stopped her.
m_mainafter_09_02_13,You let me down.
m_mainafter_09_02_14,Master might think that's selling out Rapi.
m_mainafter_09_02_15,Can't deny that.
m_mainafter_09_02_16,Sorry for freaking you out.
m_mainafter_09_02_17,Sorry.
m_mainafter_09_02_18,"But Commander, you would definitely stop me, right?"
m_mainafter_09_02_19,Of course.
m_mainafter_09_02_20,"Well, can't deny that."
m_mainafter_09_02_21,"Still, you have my gratitude."
m_mainafter_09_02_22,It is I that should thank you for your concern.
m_mainafter_09_02_23,"Whoa, I'm starting to feel a bit embarrassed."
m_mainafter_09_02_24,"Then, let's flood the screen!"
m_mainafter_09_02_25,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_26,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_27,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_28,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_29,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_30,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_31,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_32,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_33,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_34,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_35,Okay.
m_mainafter_09_02_36,... I think that's enough.
m_mainafter_12_01_1,How is everyone of Matis?
m_mainafter_12_01_2,I heard they're being put into Cold Sleep.
m_mainafter_12_01_3,I see.
m_mainafter_12_01_4,Things are getting tough.
m_mainafter_12_01_5,They'll be brought back to normal...right?
m_mainafter_12_01_6,Yes!
m_mainafter_12_01_7,Get your head out of the clouds.
m_mainafter_12_01_8,No one has ever come back
m_mainafter_12_01_9,from being corrupted.
m_mainafter_12_01_10,"Since Syuen decided to put them into Cold Sleep, she must have something in mind."
m_mainafter_12_01_11,Agreed.
m_mainafter_12_01_12,She's just buying time.
m_mainafter_12_01_13,"Eunhwa,"
m_mainafter_12_01_14,why are you so upset?
m_mainafter_12_01_15,Because if those morons
m_mainafter_12_01_16,"had been more careful,"
m_mainafter_12_01_17,they wouldn't be where they are now.
m_mainafter_12_01_18,They did their best.
m_mainafter_12_01_19,"Well, their best wasn't good enough."
m_mainafter_12_01_20,"They always go on about being the best of the best,"
m_mainafter_12_01_21,and now look at them.
m_mainafter_12_01_22,They should be ashamed of themselves.
m_mainafter_12_01_23,Eunhwa.
m_mainafter_12_01_24,Them being corrupted is a massive blow to the Ark.
m_mainafter_12_01_25,Their negligence is what caused all of this.
m_mainafter_12_01_26,Then wouldn't it be better if they could be brought back?
m_mainafter_12_01_27,"Yes, it would."
m_mainafter_12_01_28,But it's impossible.
m_mainafter_12_01_29,I'm going to bed.
m_mainafter_12_01_30,"Don't judge her too harshly, Commander."
m_mainafter_12_01_31,She's sad that she lost a powerful rival.
m_mainafter_12_01_32,I understand her.
m_mainafter_12_01_33,You do?
m_mainafter_12_01_34,...
m_mainafter_12_01_35,"Anyway, I need to sleep."
m_mainafter_12_01_36,I'm muting my notifications.
m_mainafter_13_01_1,I heard!
m_mainafter_13_01_2,He made it! Yahoo!!
m_mainafter_13_01_3,Made it halfway is more like it.
m_mainafter_13_01_4,We don't know that for sure just yet!
m_mainafter_13_01_5,"Commander, are you okay?"
m_mainafter_13_01_6,I heard that you were wounded :'(
m_mainafter_13_01_7,It's nothing.
m_mainafter_13_01_8,Don't think too much.
m_mainafter_13_01_9,Just focus on getting some rest.
m_mainafter_13_01_10,"Yeah, you've been through a lot."
m_mainafter_13_01_11,You did pretty well... for a puny weakling.
m_mainafter_13_01_12,Rest up.
m_mainafter_13_02_1,Commander!!
m_mainafter_13_02_2,Coommmaaanndddeerrr!!
m_mainafter_13_02_3,Commander...
m_mainafter_13_02_4,Yes?
m_mainafter_13_02_5,See? I told you they would be fine.
m_mainafter_13_02_6,Is everyone okay?
m_mainafter_13_02_7,Yup.
m_mainafter_13_02_8,"AZX took a bit of a beating,"
m_mainafter_13_02_9,but we're fine.
m_mainafter_13_02_10,How's Marian?
m_mainafter_13_02_11,Is she okay? Does she recognize you?
m_mainafter_13_02_12,Soline...
m_mainafter_13_02_13,how about we save the questions for later?
m_mainafter_13_02_14,Oh... okay.
m_mainafter_13_02_15,"You must be feeling pretty banged up, Commander."
m_mainafter_13_02_16,I'll ask you when you're feeling better.
m_mainafter_13_02_17,Okay.
m_mainafter_13_02_18,That was one heck of a fight. You did well.
m_mainafter_13_02_19,"Now, get some rest."
m_mainafter_13_03_1,"That's it, that's the last straw!"
m_mainafter_13_03_2,?
m_mainafter_13_03_3,What is that?
m_mainafter_13_03_4,"When that explosion happened in the tunnel,"
m_mainafter_13_03_5,Sugar took off on her motorcycle!
m_mainafter_13_03_6,She ran off trying to save her own skin!
m_mainafter_13_03_7,:O !!!
m_mainafter_13_03_8,I'll have you know Black Typhoon doesn't have any rescue-related functions.
m_mainafter_13_03_9,"But it can at least sit two more passengers, can't it?"
m_mainafter_13_03_10,Correct.
m_mainafter_13_03_11,So why didn't you take Frima and me?
m_mainafter_13_03_12,"I was in a hurry, all right?!"
m_mainafter_13_03_13,So... mad...
m_mainafter_13_03_14,can't... talk...
m_mainafter_13_03_15,Calm down.
m_mainafter_13_03_16,"If it'd happened to you, you'd be furious too!"
m_mainafter_13_03_17,:O !!!
m_mainafter_13_03_18,"Hey, Partner!"
m_mainafter_13_03_19,Did you hear?
m_mainafter_13_03_20,Isn't it wonderful?
m_mainafter_13_03_21,It's all thanks to you guys.
m_mainafter_13_03_22,No no no.
m_mainafter_13_03_23,It's thanks to ME.
m_mainafter_13_03_24,These two were late to the party.
m_mainafter_13_03_25,... Are you in the cafe right now?
m_mainafter_13_03_26,Stay where you are.
m_mainafter_13_04_1,Commander.
m_mainafter_13_04_2,I'm waiting for you.
m_mainafter_13_04_3,"I know, that's why I'm sending you a message."
m_mainafter_13_04_4,Can you tell me what exactly we saw back there?
m_mainafter_13_04_5,"You mean, Red Hood?"
m_mainafter_13_04_6,Sorry.
m_mainafter_13_04_7,"It's classified,"
m_mainafter_13_04_8,so I still don't have any information.
m_mainafter_13_04_9,"Right now, I'm not sure about anything."
m_mainafter_13_04_10,"When all those doubts become certainties,"
m_mainafter_13_04_11,you'll be the first to know. I promise.
m_mainafter_13_04_12,If you say so.
m_mainafter_13_04_13,Thank you for understanding.
m_mainafter_14_01_1,Marian has joined the group.
m_mainafter_14_01_2,What is that?
m_mainafter_14_01_3,This is our group chat.
m_mainafter_14_01_4,Welcome.
m_mainafter_14_01_5,Welcome.
m_mainafter_14_01_6,Welcome.
m_mainafter_14_01_7,Wow.
m_mainafter_14_01_8,All of you are here!
m_mainafter_14_01_9,Lok roward to wokrig with yo jall.
m_mainafter_14_01_10,Look forward to woroking with you all.
m_mainafter_14_01_11,Looks like you haven't quite gotten the hang of sending messages.
m_mainafter_14_01_12,"Don't worry, take your time."
m_mainafter_14_01_13,"Okay, thanks. I will."
m_mainafter_14_02_1,"Hey,"
m_mainafter_14_02_2,has anyone seen the soda I put on my bed?
m_mainafter_14_02_3,Negative.
m_mainafter_14_02_4,Never saw it.
m_mainafter_14_02_5,Nope.
m_mainafter_14_02_6,Me neither.
m_mainafter_14_02_7,This is bad...
m_mainafter_14_02_8,Why?
m_mainafter_14_02_9,That was no ordinary soda.
m_mainafter_14_02_10,That was a magical powder!
m_mainafter_14_02_11,Anyone who drinks it will slowly turn into a vending machine.
m_mainafter_14_02_12,Huh??
m_mainafter_14_02_13,Erm...
m_mainafter_14_02_14,then...
m_mainafter_14_02_15,what could they do to stop it?
m_mainafter_14_02_16,Eat two tubes of toothpaste.
m_mainafter_14_02_17,Hmm...
m_mainafter_14_02_18,"Marian, did you see the message?"
m_mainafter_14_02_19,Marian?
m_mainafter_14_02_20,...
m_mainafter_14_02_21,Bahahahaha!
m_mainafter_14_02_22,She must be downing toothpaste right now. Hehehe
m_mainafter_14_02_23,You're so mean.
m_mainafter_14_02_24,Marian deserved it.
m_mainafter_14_02_25,"Anis, you went too far."
m_mainafter_14_02_26,That's right.
m_mainafter_14_02_27,There's nothing in this world I despise more than soda thieves!
m_mainafter_14_02_28,"Pssh,"
m_mainafter_14_02_29,I had to teach her a lesson.
m_mainafter_14_02_30,"OMG, you guys!"
m_mainafter_14_02_31,"Lmao, this is amazing!"
m_mainafter_14_02_32,"She mistook the body lotion for toothpaste, and now she's brushing her teeth with it!"
m_mainafter_14_02_33,Hahaha!!!
m_mainafter_14_02_34,"... Actually, I really shouldn't laugh :|"
m_mainafter_14_02_35,This isn't going to end well...
m_mainafter_14_03_1,Marian left the group.
m_mainafter_14_03_2,Huh?
m_mainafter_14_03_3,Marian left?
m_mainafter_14_03_4,What's going on?
m_mainafter_14_03_5,We're not getting any signal from her.
m_mainafter_14_03_6,She might be being followed.
m_mainafter_14_03_7,This could be Snow White's doing.
m_mainafter_14_03_8,Could be.
m_mainafter_14_03_9,She could've at least said goodbye before leaving.
m_mainafter_14_03_10,Perhaps she thought doing that would put us in danger.
m_mainafter_14_03_11,"If I had known this would happen,"
m_mainafter_14_03_12,I would have spoken to her more.
m_mainafter_14_03_13,And take more photos with her!
m_mainafter_14_03_14,Me too!
m_mainafter_14_03_15,"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll see each other again."
m_mainafter_14_03_16,I guess you're right.
m_mainafter_14_03_17,"Yeah, the Commander has a point."
m_mainafter_14_03_18,We'll take plenty of photos the next time we meet.
m_mainafter_14_04_1,"Hi, Sweetie11!!! :D"
m_mainafter_14_04_2,"How have you been, Rookie? ;)"
m_mainafter_14_04_3,Is this the group chat of your chamber of commerce?
m_mainafter_14_04_4,Not bad.
m_mainafter_14_04_5,That's right.
m_mainafter_14_04_6,"We've met at our shop a few times before, haven't we?"
m_mainafter_14_04_7,How are those supplies treating you?
m_mainafter_14_04_8,Anything I can do for you?
m_mainafter_14_04_9,Hmm... How should I put this?
m_mainafter_14_04_10,"I know you're awfully busy right now, so this is a bit awkward..."
m_mainafter_14_04_11,"Oh for crying out loud, I'll tell him."
m_mainafter_14_04_12,Is that so?
m_mainafter_14_04_13,Our intel says otherwise.
m_mainafter_14_04_14,It says you've been under attack by marauders searching for the black box.
m_mainafter_14_04_15,The Outpost is practically a war zone right now.
m_mainafter_14_04_16,:'(
m_mainafter_14_04_17,How awful!! Those big meanies!
m_mainafter_14_04_18,"In light of your situation, we have reached a decision."
m_mainafter_14_04_19,We will offer you our assistance.
m_mainafter_14_04_20,What kind of assistance?
m_mainafter_14_04_21,"You do realize who you're speaking with, right?"
m_mainafter_14_04_22,Do we have to spell it out?
m_mainafter_14_04_23,MONEY ☆
m_mainafter_14_04_24,Moolah.
m_mainafter_14_04_25,Resources.
m_mainafter_14_04_26,Let me give you the lowdown.
m_mainafter_14_04_27,We are in possession of coordinates leading to a massive stash of treasure up on the surface.
m_mainafter_14_04_28,"However, as you know, Nikkes"
m_mainafter_14_04_29,are not allowed to fight outside without a commander :(
m_mainafter_14_04_30,That's where you come into play.
m_mainafter_14_04_31,"Considering the state your Outpost is in, I'm sure you could use some additional funds."
m_mainafter_14_04_32,"Besides, going up to the surface is your whole thing, isn't it?"
m_mainafter_14_04_33,This is the long and short of it:
m_mainafter_14_04_34,"You and the Counters escort us to the coordinates,"
m_mainafter_14_04_35,and we split the treasure with you.
m_mainafter_14_04_36,What's our take?
m_mainafter_14_04_37,I see.
m_mainafter_14_04_38,We split everything 50/50.
m_mainafter_14_04_39,We trust that you'll find this offer rather generous.
m_mainafter_14_04_40,"Typically, the party who introduced the deal gets a bigger share."
m_mainafter_14_04_41,Can you not bump it up a bit to sweeten the deal?
m_mainafter_14_04_42,Fair enough.
m_mainafter_14_04_43,...
m_mainafter_14_04_44,"As much as we would like to,"
m_mainafter_14_04_45,that would result in a complete absence of profit for us.
m_mainafter_14_04_46,"All right, forget about it."
m_mainafter_14_04_47,"So, is it a deal?"
m_mainafter_14_04_48,You've made a wise choice.
m_mainafter_14_04_49,I'll inform you of the coordinates and time later.
m_mainafter_15_01_1,Which squad will it be?
m_mainafter_15_01_2,You mean the supporting unit?
m_mainafter_15_01_3,Yes.
m_mainafter_15_01_4,"Considering that Matis has just been revived,"
m_mainafter_15_01_5,they wouldn't be redeployed so soon after.
m_mainafter_15_01_6,My thoughts exactly.
m_mainafter_15_01_7,I think Syuen will try to take advantage of all the eyes that are on Matis right now.
m_mainafter_15_01_8,What about M.M.R.?
m_mainafter_15_01_9,Maybe Wardress will be deployed.
m_mainafter_15_01_10,Who knows?
m_mainafter_15_01_11,Although I've never seen a single member
m_mainafter_15_01_12,venture outside of that research institute.
m_mainafter_15_01_13,Me neither.
m_mainafter_15_01_14,"Actually, are they even allowed to leave that place?"
m_mainafter_15_01_15,Who knows?
m_mainafter_15_01_16,"They're responsible for capturing Raptures,"
m_mainafter_15_01_17,not going out on search expeditions.
m_mainafter_15_01_18,"Actually, the Scouts would probably be"
m_mainafter_15_01_19,the most appropriate for the job.
m_mainafter_15_01_20,"Yeah, you're probably right."
m_mainafter_15_01_21,"The Scouts aren't manufactured by Missilis,"
m_mainafter_15_01_22,"but if Syuen can swallow her pride for one second and ask Ingrid for a favor,"
m_mainafter_15_01_23,I'm sure she'd be willing to oblige.
m_mainafter_15_01_24,"The only thing is,"
m_mainafter_15_01_25,you know perfectly well Syuen can't do that.
m_mainafter_15_01_26,"Yeah,"
m_mainafter_15_01_27,that's not her style.
m_mainafter_15_01_28,:|
m_mainafter_15_01_29,:|
m_mainafter_15_01_30,"Jeez,"
m_mainafter_15_01_31,is her pride really so important to her?
m_mainafter_15_01_32,Don't think about it too much.
m_mainafter_15_01_33,Precisely.
m_mainafter_15_01_34,"No matter which squad ends up being our support, it'll be better than nothing."
m_mainafter_17_01_1,"Oops, sorry! I just noticed your messages.
Yeesh, there are so many...
Sorry again.
I'll try and check my message more often."
m_mainafter_17_01_2,Don't worry about it.
m_mainafter_17_01_3,"My good fellow, hast thou arrived in the Ark?"
m_mainafter_17_01_4,"Yes. I'm here safe and sound, thanks to Rapunzel."
m_mainafter_17_01_5,:p
m_mainafter_17_01_6,Well done!
m_mainafter_17_01_7,"At long last, the knights of the round have all gathered in one locale!"
m_mainafter_17_01_8,We must all drink and be merry!
m_mainafter_17_01_9,"Scarlet, are you drinking already?"
m_mainafter_17_01_10,Isn't your destination really far out?
m_mainafter_17_01_11,I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly.
m_mainafter_17_01_12,?
m_mainafter_17_01_13,What is that?
m_mainafter_17_01_14,"Alas, I have yet to arrive!"
m_mainafter_17_01_15,So you're drinking on the move?
m_mainafter_17_01_16,"Indeed! Ye truly understand me, right to mine core."
m_mainafter_17_01_17,With weather as splendid as this
m_mainafter_17_01_18,one simply must imbibe!
m_mainafter_17_01_19,Did I not tell you last time? Drink somewhere safe.
m_mainafter_17_01_20,"Indeed, thou speakest the truth."
m_mainafter_17_01_21,But one cannot so easily resist the temptation of such fine weather!
m_mainafter_17_01_22,"The finer the weather, the bigger the pour!"
m_mainafter_17_01_23,"Speaking of, I must fetch another cup."
m_mainafter_17_01_24,"Until we meet again, my friends."
m_mainafter_17_01_25,See you :|
m_mainafter_17_01_26,"Fine.
Try and stay alive until then, all of you."
m_mainafter_17_01_27,"Take care of yourselves, guys!"
m_mainafter_17_02_1,"Commander, are you okay?"
m_mainafter_17_02_2,"Other than what she told us, did Syuen say anything else?"
m_mainafter_17_02_3,How did Matis respond to the plan?
m_mainafter_17_02_4,"Anis, calm down."
m_mainafter_17_02_5,"Wow, Anis is full of questions today!"
m_mainafter_17_02_6,... Sorry.
m_mainafter_17_02_7,"I must admit, I'm awfully curious myself, Master."
m_mainafter_17_02_8,Syuen lied to Matis.
m_mainafter_17_02_9,??
m_mainafter_17_02_10,She said they are going to build new defensive walls for the Ark up on the surface.
m_mainafter_17_02_11,Huh?
m_mainafter_17_02_12,That's absurd!
m_mainafter_17_02_13,Hmm...
m_mainafter_17_02_14,They think they're off to do the right thing.
m_mainafter_17_02_15,"When they find out the truth, they're in for one heck of a shock..."
m_mainafter_17_02_16,I must tell Matis the truth.
m_mainafter_17_02_17,Don't do that.
m_mainafter_17_02_18,Commander!!
m_mainafter_17_02_19,"Don't tell me this is for their own good! It's lying to them, plain and simple!"
m_mainafter_17_02_20,Syuen hopes to keep the situation under wraps.
m_mainafter_17_02_21,Why would she want to do that?
m_mainafter_17_02_22,"If she didn't, Matis wouldn't be willing to go up to the surface."
m_mainafter_17_02_23,So what?! That's their choice to make!
m_mainafter_17_02_24,"If they were to refuse, they'd have their memories wiped."
m_mainafter_17_02_25,That's not 100% certain.
m_mainafter_17_02_26,Just look at public opinion right now.
m_mainafter_17_02_27,The people are in a furor. Syuen can't possibly turn a blind eye to that.
m_mainafter_17_02_28,Good point.
m_mainafter_17_02_29,How sad...
m_mainafter_17_02_30,"Given the gravity of the situation, Enikk would be justified in carrying out a memory wipe"
m_mainafter_17_02_31,if it meant appeasing the public.
m_mainafter_17_02_32,No.
m_mainafter_17_02_33,Nononono!
m_mainafter_17_02_34,I refuse to accept that!
m_mainafter_17_02_35,Feel however you want; it won't change anything.
m_mainafter_17_02_36,"The decision has been made, and Matis has to go."
m_mainafter_17_02_37,I don't want to go to the surface!
m_mainafter_18_01_01,"Hey Cutey, how are you feeling?"
m_mainafter_18_01_02,I heard that Laplace came to visit you.
m_mainafter_18_01_03,Of course. It is a hero's duty to visit those in need!
m_mainafter_18_01_04,How are you holding up?
m_mainafter_18_01_05,"Much better, thanks."
m_mainafter_18_01_06,That's great!
m_mainafter_18_01_07,"If you're feeling better, why not come visit us?"
m_mainafter_18_01_08,Just because he feels better
m_mainafter_18_01_09,doesn't mean he's been discharged from the hospital.
m_mainafter_18_01_10,!!
m_mainafter_18_01_11,Fine. Don't come then.
m_mainafter_18_01_12,How about you guys? Is everything good?
m_mainafter_18_01_13,"Yeah, we're doing all right."
m_mainafter_18_01_14,"Thanks to Missilis' state-of-the-art technology, we've made a full recovery."
m_mainafter_18_01_15,Hurry up and get better
m_mainafter_18_01_16,so that you can visit us!!
m_mainafter_18_01_17,I'll do that.
m_mainafter_18_01_18,Syuen and I have caused a lot of trouble for you.
m_mainafter_18_01_19,"But thanks to you, we don't have to be implanted with the NIMPH!"
m_mainafter_18_01_20,We won't ever forget what you've done for us.
m_mainafter_18_01_21,Words cannot begin to express my gratitude.
m_mainafter_18_01_22,Me too! Thank you again!!!
m_mainafter_18_01_23,A hero never forgets those who lend her a helping hand.
m_mainafter_18_01_24,"Well, I think you two have gotten the point across. No need for me to keep hammering it in."
m_mainafter_18_01_25,Seriously? How can you be so rude?
m_mainafter_18_01_26,I'm just kidding! Of course I'm incredibly grateful.
m_mainafter_18_01_27,You all really impressed me.
m_mainafter_18_01_28,You're the one who had it the worst.
m_mainafter_18_01_29,"All right, that's enough talking for now. You should rest up."
m_mainafter_18_01_30,"See you next time, Cutey."
m_mainafter_18_01_31,See you soon.
m_mainafter_18_01_32,"Can't wait to see you again, Birdie!"
m_mainafter_18_01_33,"Hero, bye!!"
m_ex_laplace_01_1,The hero!
m_ex_laplace_01_2,Laplace!
m_ex_laplace_01_3,Has!
m_ex_laplace_01_4,Arrived!
m_ex_laplace_01_5,Looks like we're working together from now on.
m_ex_laplace_01_6,I'm looking forward to it!
m_ex_laplace_01_7,I can't remember the last time I was paired up with an ordinary human.
m_ex_laplace_01_8,"Don't worry, though."
m_ex_laplace_01_9,You can leave everything to me!
m_ex_laplace_01_10,I'd rather we work together to solve problems.
m_ex_laplace_01_11,??
m_ex_laplace_01_12,"A heroic Nikke, like me, teaming up with a human?"
m_ex_laplace_01_13,Is that what you're telling me?
m_ex_laplace_01_14,That's right.
m_ex_laplace_01_15,Hahahaha!
m_ex_laplace_01_16,That's impossible!
m_ex_laplace_01_17,There's a world of difference between humans and even the most ordinary of Nikkes.
m_ex_laplace_01_18,And I assure you that I'm no ordinary Nikke.
m_ex_laplace_01_19,What can you possibly contribute?
m_ex_laplace_01_20,We're comrades.
m_ex_laplace_01_21,Say what?
m_ex_laplace_01_22,"If we work towards the same goal, that makes us comrades."
m_ex_laplace_01_23,!!
m_ex_laplace_01_24,Can't argue with you there.
m_ex_laplace_01_25,"All right, then. You'll be my new sidekick."
m_ex_laplace_01_26,Your call sign will be...
m_ex_laplace_01_27,Birdie!
m_ex_laplace_01_28,Why Birdie?
m_ex_laplace_01_29,That's the name of the sidekick in my favorite movie!
m_ex_laplace_01_30,"All right, then!"
m_ex_laplace_01_31,Onward we go! As heroes!
m_ex_laplace_01_32,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_laplace_01_33,Let's go!
m_ex_laplace_01_34,"That's the spirit, Birdie!"
m_ex_laplace_02_1,Birdie!
m_ex_laplace_02_2,"We've got a small problem,"
m_ex_laplace_02_3,"so I need your help, Birdie!"
m_ex_laplace_02_4,Did you break another window?
m_ex_laplace_02_5,Did you smash up a doorway?
m_ex_laplace_02_6,??
m_ex_laplace_02_7,How is breaking a window a problem now?
m_ex_laplace_02_8,A what now?
m_ex_laplace_02_9,"Oh, you mean those weird-shaped obstacles that are in every room."
m_ex_laplace_02_10,So that's what they're called. I've gotta remember that.
m_ex_laplace_02_11,"Anyway,"
m_ex_laplace_02_12,"we are conducting a rescue operation, and the building is on the verge of collapse."
m_ex_laplace_02_13,"Soooo, I'm trying to hold it up right now."
m_ex_laplace_02_14,What?!
m_ex_laplace_02_15,Get the Mighty Tools over pronto!
m_ex_laplace_02_16,"I may be a hero,"
m_ex_laplace_02_17,but that doesn't mean I can repair buildings.
m_ex_laplace_02_18,"Wait, how are you talking to me right now?"
m_ex_laplace_02_19,I'm holding the building up with one hand while texting you with the other!
m_ex_laplace_02_20,"Use both hands, for goodness sake!"
m_ex_laplace_02_21,Hahaha!
m_ex_laplace_02_22,"You worry too much, Birdie!"
m_ex_laplace_02_23,This is nothing for a hero like me!
m_ex_laplace_02_24,I've been through much worse than this.
m_ex_laplace_02_25,Have you ever seen the high-rise buildings in downtown Ark?
m_ex_laplace_02_26,"One time, one of them nearly collapsed. Oh boy, let me tell you, I thought my goose was cooked then!"
m_ex_laplace_02_27,"If Maxwell and Drake hadn't arrived when they did, I'd have..."
m_ex_laplace_02_28,Stop texting and hold it up with both hands!
m_ex_laplace_02_29,"Hahaha! All right, all right. Keep your shirt on!"
m_ex_laplace_02_30,Laplace doesn't answer for a long time...
m_ex_laplace_02_31,Laplace!
m_ex_laplace_02_32,"My arm's getting rather sore, so I switched arms."
m_ex_laplace_02_33,Sso rrybut I'm chat tin lef t hand
m_ex_laplace_02_34,I need to hurry and call Mighty Tools.
m_ex_laplace_03_1,Birdie!
m_ex_laplace_03_2,Something really great happened today!
m_ex_laplace_03_3,"I wanted you to be the first to know, so I contacted you right away."
m_ex_laplace_03_4,What happened?
m_ex_laplace_03_5,I received a fan letter!
m_ex_laplace_03_6,"Let me read it to you, so you better pay attention!"
m_ex_laplace_03_7,"For a while, there's nothing but silence."
m_ex_laplace_03_8,"Did you hear that, Birdie?"
m_ex_laplace_03_9,"Brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?"
m_ex_laplace_03_10,Erm... I didn't hear anything.
m_ex_laplace_03_11,Oh.
m_ex_laplace_03_12,I thought it was a voice call.
m_ex_laplace_03_13,"No probs, I'll just type it out."
m_ex_laplace_03_14,"Hello, Laplace."
m_ex_laplace_03_15,"Thanks to your heroic deeds,"
m_ex_laplace_03_16,our district is once again thriving.
m_ex_laplace_03_17,You helped us band together and work towards a common goal:
m_ex_laplace_03_18,repairing all the broken windows you left behind.
m_ex_laplace_03_19,"The crater you made during your grand entrance shattered the water pipes,"
m_ex_laplace_03_20,so we've all been sharing whatever water we have.
m_ex_laplace_03_21,Thank you for teaching us the joy of working together and sharing with our neighbors.
m_ex_laplace_03_22,You call that a fan letter?
m_ex_laplace_03_23,"Oh, right. The large amount of fire extinguishing fluid you used to put out the fire"
m_ex_laplace_03_24,"is still running down the walls of the building,"
m_ex_laplace_03_25,but it allowed us to escape unscathed.
m_ex_laplace_03_26,"Thank you so much, Laplace."
m_ex_laplace_03_27,I can't wait to see what you have in store for us in the future.
m_ex_laplace_03_28,I would love to meet you sometime.
m_ex_laplace_03_29,Please let me know when's a good time for you.
m_ex_laplace_03_30,I'd love to meet you in person to repay you for your deed.
m_ex_laplace_03_31,That's it!
m_ex_laplace_03_32,This fan letter...
m_ex_laplace_03_33,Woo-hoo!
m_ex_laplace_03_34,This is what being a hero is all about!
m_ex_laplace_03_35,I've got to meet my number one fan!
m_ex_laplace_03_36,I would suggest against that.
m_ex_laplace_03_37,Why!!??
m_ex_laplace_03_38,It's cooler to maintain an aura of mystery.
m_ex_laplace_03_39,"After all, heroes don't do meet-and-greets."
m_ex_laplace_03_40,!!
m_ex_laplace_03_41,Makes sense.
m_ex_laplace_03_42,I'll just keep this letter close and never lose this feeling!
m_ex_laplace_03_43,Quick! We must strike while the iron is hot!
m_ex_laplace_03_44,Let the special training begin!
m_ex_helm_01_1,"I'm Helm, the leader of the Aegis Squad, as well as the captain of the Admire."
m_ex_helm_01_2,It's an honor to fight together with you.
m_ex_helm_01_3,I'm looking forward to it.
m_ex_helm_01_4,Sum here.
m_ex_helm_01_5,??
m_ex_helm_01_6,Same here.
m_ex_helm_01_7,"Oh, a typo."
m_ex_helm_01_8,I thought you may have meant something else.
m_ex_helm_01_9,"I don't use Blabla much,"
m_ex_helm_01_10,so I'm not up to date on all the newest lingo.
m_ex_helm_01_11,You'll get better at it if you chat with me more.
m_ex_helm_01_12,"No worries, you've got bigger fish to fry."
m_ex_helm_01_13,"I appreciate it,"
m_ex_helm_01_14,but I already have a lot on my plate.
m_ex_helm_01_15,That's right.
m_ex_helm_01_16,There are more important things in life.
m_ex_helm_01_17,For example?
m_ex_helm_01_18,Are you asking because you're actually curious?
m_ex_helm_01_19,Or are you just messing with me?
m_ex_helm_01_20,??
m_ex_helm_01_21,Oh.
m_ex_helm_01_22,"Sorry,"
m_ex_helm_01_23,I guess you really don't know what we do at Aegis.
m_ex_helm_01_24,"You operate a massive ship, don't you?"
m_ex_helm_01_25,"You're essentially the navy, right?"
m_ex_helm_01_26,That's right.
m_ex_helm_01_27,However...
m_ex_helm_01_28,Hmm... I'm a little reluctant to say this.
m_ex_helm_01_29,"It's nothing embarrassing, but it's not exactly something to be proud of."
m_ex_helm_01_30,"If you have time, you're more than welcome to attend our next boat party."
m_ex_helm_01_31,Then you'll see what Aegis is all about.
m_ex_helm_01_32,I'll definitely be there if I get the chance.
m_ex_helm_01_33,Sounds good.
m_ex_helm_01_34,Talk to you later.
m_ex_helm_02_1,"Hey, Subordinate."
m_ex_helm_02_2,Someone donated an item that I can't make heads or tails of.
m_ex_helm_02_3,I was wondering if you'd know anything about it.
m_ex_helm_02_4,What does it look like?
m_ex_helm_02_5,"There are two of them, actually. It looks like they come as a pair."
m_ex_helm_02_6,"One of them has two triangles attached to a string,"
m_ex_helm_02_7,while the other only has one.
m_ex_helm_02_8,Wouldn't it be easier to just send a photo?
m_ex_helm_02_9,I think it might be a military item
m_ex_helm_02_10,that may leak top-secret information.
m_ex_helm_02_11,What's it made of?
m_ex_helm_02_12,How big is it?
m_ex_helm_02_13,I'm not too sure.
m_ex_helm_02_14,"From its texture and luster, it's seems to be something waterproof."
m_ex_helm_02_15,Hard to say.
m_ex_helm_02_16,"One of the strings is roughly the length of a person's torso, while the other is just as long as their pelvis."
m_ex_helm_02_17,"Oh, right."
m_ex_helm_02_18,"The attached triangles are tiny,"
m_ex_helm_02_19,even smaller than the palm of your hand.
m_ex_helm_02_20,It sounds like she's describing a...
m_ex_helm_02_21,Anything coming to mind?
m_ex_helm_02_22,I think it may be a swimsuit.
m_ex_helm_02_23,I think it may be a diving suit.
m_ex_helm_02_24,What?
m_ex_helm_02_25,Like for swimming?
m_ex_helm_02_26,Subordinate...
m_ex_helm_02_27,"I may not know much, but..."
m_ex_helm_02_28,Wait a sec...
m_ex_helm_02_29,The length of the strings and the places where the triangles are attached.
m_ex_helm_02_30,I think you may be right.
m_ex_helm_02_31,"Hold on, let me put it on."
m_ex_helm_02_32,You're going to what?
m_ex_helm_02_33,Helm doesn't answer for a while...
m_ex_helm_02_34,It really is a swimsuit.
m_ex_helm_02_35,But...
m_ex_helm_02_36,"I have to say,"
m_ex_helm_02_37,it's awfully skimpy
m_ex_helm_02_38,and uncomfortable.
m_ex_helm_02_39,Aren't swimsuits supposed to be comfortable?
m_ex_helm_02_40,So you tried it on?
m_ex_helm_02_41,What?
m_ex_helm_02_42,"Oh, um..."
m_ex_helm_02_43,"Yeah,"
m_ex_helm_02_44,I did.
m_ex_helm_02_45,I wore it...
m_ex_helm_02_46,"over my clothes though,"
m_ex_helm_02_47,"so don't get any funny ideas now,"
m_ex_helm_02_48,all right?
m_ex_helm_02_49,Okay.
m_ex_helm_02_50,Good.
m_ex_helm_02_51,Well... now that that's settled...
m_ex_helm_02_52,Go now
m_ex_helm_02_53,and get some rest.
m_ex_helm_03_1,"Hey, are you good at swimming?"
m_ex_helm_03_2,"It's kind of embarrassing to say out loud,"
m_ex_helm_03_3,but I'm an excellent swimmer.
m_ex_helm_03_4,"When you put me in water, I'm like a fish."
m_ex_helm_03_5,What makes you ask?
m_ex_helm_03_6,Folkwang was eyeballing me
m_ex_helm_03_7,when I was practicing at the swimming pool.
m_ex_helm_03_8,"After a while,"
m_ex_helm_03_9,she challenged me to a swimming race.
m_ex_helm_03_10,"Apparently, she's pretty competitive."
m_ex_helm_03_11,"I was getting a little bored swimming on my own,"
m_ex_helm_03_12,so I wanted to test my skills.
m_ex_helm_03_13,I could prove what Aegis is capable of
m_ex_helm_03_14,and why we are the Navy.
m_ex_helm_03_15,Sounds like you were excited.
m_ex_helm_03_16,"Of course, I was!"
m_ex_helm_03_17,"Nikkes can't typically swim,"
m_ex_helm_03_18,so a swimming competition isn't something you see every day.
m_ex_helm_03_19,??
m_ex_helm_03_20,What's wrong?
m_ex_helm_03_21,Does that mean Folkwang can't swim either?
m_ex_helm_03_22,"Oh, that..."
m_ex_helm_03_23,"Well, Folkwang decided to run on water."
m_ex_helm_03_24,"Since she's a track athlete, it should probably work for her?"
m_ex_helm_03_25,No kidding.
m_ex_helm_03_26,"Anyway, come watch if you have time."
m_ex_helm_03_27,It'll be fun.
m_ex_helm_03_28,I'll make sure not to miss it.
m_ex_helm_03_29,"All right, I'm off to practice."
m_ex_helm_03_30,I'm sure the competition will be an exhilarating one in numerous ways...
m_ex_neve_01_1,Alice!
m_ex_neve_01_2,Are you with Ludmilla?
m_ex_neve_01_3,I caant erach her.
m_ex_neve_01_4,"I was looking for some poalr brears, and I'm exhausted"
m_ex_neve_01_5,NeEd...sleep.
m_ex_neve_01_6,Coul dyou let Ludmilla know for me?
m_ex_neve_01_7,Othweise shelll be wOrried
m_ex_neve_01_8,I'll talk toy ou jatler
m_ex_neve_01_9,I think you've got the wrong person.
m_ex_neve_01_10,Neve doesn't send any more messages.
m_ex_neve_02_1,Burly Bear!
m_ex_neve_02_2,Are you busy?!
m_ex_neve_02_3,Not really.
m_ex_neve_02_4,Perfect!
m_ex_neve_02_5,Have you ever made an igloo?
m_ex_neve_02_6,Why do you ask?
m_ex_neve_02_7,"I've been dying to make one,"
m_ex_neve_02_8,but I don't know how.
m_ex_neve_02_9,Why do you want to make an igloo?
m_ex_neve_02_10,"To sleep in, of course!"
m_ex_neve_02_11,That way I can finally some decent sleep.
m_ex_neve_02_12,Wouldn't it be better to sleep in a cave?
m_ex_neve_02_13,Wouldn't it be better to sleep in the dorm?
m_ex_neve_02_14,There aren't any suitable caves near here.
m_ex_neve_02_15,The dorm is too far away. I'd fall asleep on the way over.
m_ex_neve_02_16,"Oh boy, so sleepy."
m_ex_neve_02_17,I can berly keep my eYes opeN
m_ex_neve_02_18,Whats housl I do/?
m_ex_neve_02_19,I'll just slepp in the snOw
m_ex_neve_02_20,Don't! It's too dangerous.
m_ex_neve_02_21,Don't care.
m_ex_neve_02_22,Polar beeeeeeeeeeeee
m_ex_neve_02_23,??
m_ex_neve_02_24,nb34rq3@$FFFF32
m_ex_neve_02_25,... Good night.
m_ex_neve_02_26,Guess she fell asleep while typing.
m_ex_neve_03_1,Burly Bear!
m_ex_neve_03_2,What are some things you can do with snow?
m_ex_neve_03_3,Have a snowball fight.
m_ex_neve_03_4,Make a snowman.
m_ex_neve_03_5,But you need more than one person
m_ex_neve_03_6,"to have a snowball fight, don't you?"
m_ex_neve_03_7,How about making a snow sculpture?
m_ex_neve_03_8,Sounds like fun!
m_ex_neve_03_9,What should I make?
m_ex_neve_03_10,A polar bear.
m_ex_neve_03_11,A penguin.
m_ex_neve_03_12,That's a great idea!
m_ex_neve_03_13,Hmm... wouldn't a polar bear be better?
m_ex_neve_03_14,There are polar bears in this area.
m_ex_neve_03_15,Maybe they'll think it's a real polar bear and come over to check it out.
m_ex_neve_03_16,Smart thinking.
m_ex_neve_03_17,"Before I get started, a quick nap!"
m_ex_neve_03_18,Too sleepy to starsat now
m_ex_neve_03_19,We'll takl about the dtials once I wakae up
m_ex_neve_03_20,don't send me anay messagesa
m_ex_talentum_03_1,Everybody!
m_ex_talentum_03_2,Have you heard?
m_ex_talentum_03_3,Heard what?
m_ex_talentum_03_4,What's up?
m_ex_talentum_03_5,Wouldn't you like to know?
m_ex_talentum_03_6,"Hehe, just kidding :D"
m_ex_talentum_03_7,You're gonna love this.
m_ex_talentum_03_8,"Since there's such a festive atmosphere outside,"
m_ex_talentum_03_9,I figured we ought to go on a little shopping spree together.
m_ex_talentum_03_10,Wanna meet up at the boutique on Royal Road tomorrow?
m_ex_talentum_03_11,:D
m_ex_talentum_03_12,Tomorrow?
m_ex_talentum_03_13,Let me think about it.
m_ex_talentum_03_14,My time is valuable.
m_ex_talentum_03_15,Mine too.
m_ex_talentum_03_16,"I know most people like to take it easy near the end of the year,"
m_ex_talentum_03_17,but any respectable boss always keeps their nose to the grindstone.
m_ex_talentum_03_18,Those paychecks and annual bonuses aren't going to send themselves.
m_ex_talentum_03_19,You guys are such spoilsports.
m_ex_talentum_03_20,I just remembered that I'm busy tomorrow as well.
m_ex_talentum_03_21,I should have known...
m_ex_talentum_03_22,"You too, Sweetie?"
m_ex_talentum_03_23,What's gotten into you guys? :'(
m_ex_talentum_03_24,Why am I the one who always has to make plans?
m_ex_talentum_03_25,It'd be nice if one of you asked to hang out once in a while!
m_ex_talentum_03_26,Aren't we supposed to be a squad?
m_ex_talentum_03_27,Fine.
m_ex_talentum_03_28,You've convinced me.
m_ex_talentum_03_29,"Huh, really???"
m_ex_talentum_03_30,I can join you guys if we go shopping online.
m_ex_talentum_03_31,...
m_ex_talentum_03_32,We could also leave comments on your livestreams.
m_ex_talentum_03_33,"That's kind of like us shopping together, isn't it? Close enough, at least."
m_ex_talentum_03_34,"That way, we can be available even during meetings."
m_ex_talentum_03_35,Do you need a link for the Shopaholics chatroom?
m_ex_talentum_03_36,"Eh, to be honest, I don't think that's a good idea."
m_ex_talentum_03_37,Forget it!
m_ex_talentum_03_38,All you two care about is money!
m_ex_talentum_03_39,And?
m_ex_talentum_03_40,We can't do anything about it.
m_ex_talentum_03_41,How else could we buy your fancy new winter-wear?
m_ex_talentum_03_42,Not to mention all those designer bags.
m_ex_talentum_03_43,?
m_ex_talentum_03_44,What do you mean?
m_ex_talentum_03_45,Exactly what I said.
m_ex_talentum_03_46,We went out and ordered
m_ex_talentum_03_47,some designer bags and winter wear for you.
m_ex_talentum_03_48,!!!!!!
m_ex_talentum_03_49,Wow!
m_ex_talentum_03_50,"What are we gonna do, Sweetie?"
m_ex_talentum_03_51,??
m_ex_talentum_03_52,We don't deserve to be in the company
m_ex_talentum_03_53,of such distinguished young ladies.
m_ex_talentum_03_54,That's it. I'm renaming the group to:
m_ex_talentum_03_55,☆ The Distinguished Debutantes and their Devout Devotees ☆
m_ex_talentum_03_56,I'll take that as a sign that you're pleased?
m_ex_talentum_03_57,Of course!!! I'm tearing up over here!
m_ex_talentum_03_58,"In that case, how about sending 50 samples of your new product to Talentum Mall?"
m_ex_talentum_03_59,You got it!
m_ex_talentum_03_60,I'll get on it right away.
m_ex_talentum_03_61,"Just a friendly reminder,"
m_ex_talentum_03_62,we'll be releasing a new laptop model soon.
m_ex_talentum_03_63,We'd love to partner up with your brand of laptop bags.
m_ex_talentum_03_64,What do you say?
m_ex_talentum_03_65,"Let's do it! After all, isn't that what a devotee is for? :D"
m_ex_talentum_03_66,"Do you want a custom design? Name it, and we'll make it happen."
m_ex_talentum_03_67,This conversation seems to have taken a turn...
m_ex_talentum_03_68,Was this all a setup?
m_ex_talentum_03_69,"Client,"
m_ex_talentum_03_70,you're harshing our vibe.
m_ex_talentum_03_71,I think we'd have enough fun with Rupee anyway.
m_ex_talentum_03_72,Shall we call it a day?
m_ex_talentum_03_73,I've got a meeting coming up.
m_ex_talentum_03_74,Same here.
m_ex_talentum_03_75,All right.
m_ex_talentum_03_76,Wishing great fortune to our
m_ex_talentum_03_77,fabulous Talentum debutantes!
m_ex_talentum_03_78,Bye!
m_ex_talentum_04_1,Guys.
m_ex_talentum_04_2,Did any of you check your email?
m_ex_talentum_04_3,I have.
m_ex_talentum_04_4,"Apparently, the Ark is having a rough fiscal year."
m_ex_talentum_04_5,"They want us to come up with some kind of event. A seasonal promotion, a pop-up shop, that sort of thing."
m_ex_talentum_04_6,Classic email from the Central Government.
m_ex_talentum_04_7,That's rich.
m_ex_talentum_04_8,What have they ever done for us while we're out here busting our backs making a living?
m_ex_talentum_04_9,"Every quarter, it's something else with them."
m_ex_talentum_04_10,You can say that again.
m_ex_talentum_04_11,Preach.
m_ex_talentum_04_12,This isn't right.
m_ex_talentum_04_13,Why don't we simply ignore them?
m_ex_talentum_04_14,I considered it.
m_ex_talentum_04_15,I was planning on just going through the motions
m_ex_talentum_04_16,in order to keep up appearances.
m_ex_talentum_04_17,Hold a run-of-the-mill flash sale or something.
m_ex_talentum_04_18,But I don't really want to do that...
m_ex_talentum_04_19,We can't allow Talentum's reputation to suffer.
m_ex_talentum_04_20,"It's an activity organized by the Merchant Union. If we don't give it our all,"
m_ex_talentum_04_21,what will the consumers think?
m_ex_talentum_04_22,They could feel like they'd been duped by you guys.
m_ex_talentum_04_23,It could damage your brand image.
m_ex_talentum_04_24,That's precisely what I'm saying.
m_ex_talentum_04_25,Hmm...
m_ex_talentum_04_26,"All right then Rookie, have you got anything in mind?"
m_ex_talentum_04_27,Let's spitball some ideas.
m_ex_talentum_04_28,Something where we'll come out smelling like roses.
m_ex_talentum_04_29,Limited edition seasonal products?
m_ex_talentum_04_30,What about a sales event centered on gaming?
m_ex_talentum_04_31,"Sweetie,"
m_ex_talentum_04_32,do you realize how much money and R&D we'd have to invest in order
m_ex_talentum_04_33,to churn out new products for winter?
m_ex_talentum_04_34,"We'd run ourselves ragged,"
m_ex_talentum_04_35,and all we'd have to show for it is a puny pop-up shop.
m_ex_talentum_04_36,What about a sales event centered on gaming then?
m_ex_talentum_04_37,Video games?
m_ex_talentum_04_38,What do those have to do with what we're discussing?
m_ex_talentum_04_39,"Wait, actually..."
m_ex_talentum_04_40,that might not be such a bad idea.
m_ex_talentum_04_41,Yeah.
m_ex_talentum_04_42,We can build up some hype to show that Talentum is taking the gaming industry to the next level.
m_ex_talentum_04_43,"And most importantly, we don't have to make any new products."
m_ex_talentum_04_44,"Plus, we already have a professional that we can consult."
m_ex_talentum_04_45,Who?
m_ex_talentum_04_46,You don't mean...
m_ex_talentum_04_47,"That's right, you!"
m_ex_talentum_04_48,You're always in your room playing video games with Exia.
m_ex_talentum_04_49,Yeah.
m_ex_talentum_04_50,You and her camp in there practically every night
m_ex_talentum_04_51,twiddling your joysticks.
m_ex_talentum_04_52,Are we all in agreement?
m_ex_talentum_04_53,I'm in.
m_ex_talentum_04_54,Me too.
m_ex_talentum_04_55,"In that case,"
m_ex_talentum_04_56,Rookie...
m_ex_talentum_04_57,We'll leave the rest to you.
m_ex_talentum_04_58,??
m_ex_talentum_04_59,Agreed!
m_ex_talentum_04_60,"No one is more qualified to handle this than you, Sweetie!"
m_ex_talentum_04_61,But I'm not even a member of your squad...
m_ex_talentum_04_62,Don't worry about that.
m_ex_talentum_04_63,"So long as we've got financial support and the right people backing us,"
m_ex_talentum_04_64,I think we'll be able to pull this oval.
m_ex_talentum_04_65,... I'll assume that's a typo?
m_ex_talentum_04_66,"Ugh, stupid predictive text."
m_ex_talentum_04_67,It's the bane of my existence.
m_ex_talentum_04_68,"Anyway, we're counting on you, Client."
m_ex_talentum_04_69,"With your help, we'll have ourselves a grand year-end event that gamers will love."
m_ex_talentum_04_70,Sounds like you're passing the buck if you ask me...
m_ex_talentum_04_71,No one replies anymore...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_1,Teacher!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_2,Do you remember Emma's cooking last time?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_3,Wasn't it delicious?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_4,I could go for seconds.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_5,Do you actually mean that?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_6,"You really crack me up, Anne."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_7,Of course! It was super good!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_8,You don't think so?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_9,"Oh right, I remember you didn't eat very much of it."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_10,Let's just say Emma and I have different tastes.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_11,Oh...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_12,I didn't realize.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_13,I thought everyone liked her cooking.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_14,What are you talking about?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_15,Good kids would never eat that kind of stuff.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_16,Huh?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_17,... I've said too much.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_18,How about we try something other than Emma's cooking?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_19,Sure.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_20,"Nothing else has come remotely close to her cooking,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_21,so I'm open to new things.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_22,Sounds like you're happy eating nothing but Emma's cooking.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_23,I sure am!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_24,"Even when she makes the same dish,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_25,it tastes different every time.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_26,Don't you think that's impressive?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_27,"Either way though, I'll try something new if it's a recommendation from you, Teacher."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_28,What are you in the mood for?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_29,Hmm...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_30,I heard there's a new fusion restaurant in the Ark that specializes in croquettes.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_31,Can we go there?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_32,They must have all sorts of crazy new flavors.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_33,Let's go.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_34,Okay!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_01_35,This is gonna be great!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_1,Teacher!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_2,I'm so happy today!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_3,I hung out with a new friend
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_4,Anne...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_5,?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_6,I want to ask you something.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_7,"Sure,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_8,anything you want.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_9,What was that drone you were playing with?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_10,You mean Mune?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_11,Mune?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_12,"Yes, my buddy, Mune!"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_13,Rupee said that it helps
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_14,"complete the look I'm going for,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_15,so she bought it for me.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_16,And she gave it a name?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_17,"Yeah, apparently it's from an old story."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_18,Although I don't know much about the details.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_19,"To be honest, her naming it made me happier"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_20,than the gift itself.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_21,"It's a fitting name, and it does look pretty cute."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_22,"I know, right?"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_23,"Whenever it flies,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_24,it likes to hover above my head.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_25,"Teacher,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_26,"would you like to play with Mune, too?"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_27,I'm sure it'd prefer being around you.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_28,"Sure, I'll have a go."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_29,It would?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_30,It'd be nice if it got along with you too.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_31,All right! I'm sure you and Mune will get along great.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_32,Just one more thing...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_33,... Huh. What was I going to say again?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_34,I forgot.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_35,I got so excited that I forgot to write it down in my notebook.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_36,"Well, tell me when you remember it."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_02_37,Will do!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_1,Sweetie!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_2,Sweeeeeeeetie!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_3,What's the matter?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_4,... Rupee?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_5,"No, it's Anne!"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_6,Duh!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_7,"I was chatting with Rupee,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_8,and it got me thinking...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_9,I think the way she talks is super cute.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_10,:D
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_11,So I decided that I want to talk like that too!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_12,☆
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_13,It's really hard tho...>_<
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_14,T-T
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_15,"Like, super-duper hard :/"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_16,"What do you think, Teacher?"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_17,Do you like it?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_18,I still need a minute to adjust.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_19,"I didn't freak you out, did I?"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_20,A little bit.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_21,I'm not sure if my brain can handle this.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_22,Huh???
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_23,Are you feeling okay?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_24,Hello?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_25,Say something!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_26,I'm fine now.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_27,"Okay, good."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_28,I was about to take you to the hospital. :0
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_29,"We've got to keep you in tip-top shape, Teacher."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_30,"I'm fine, really."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_31,Good!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_32,You had me worried for a second.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_33,...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_34,"Teacher,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_35,"I know you were a little out of sorts just now, and I don't want to press, but..."
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_36,... Could you answer my question?
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_37,It's kind of important to me.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_38,You sound very cute.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_39,I prefer your original way of speaking.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_40,Really??
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_41,"I'm not quite sure I've got the hang of it yet,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_42,but I'll keep at it.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_43,...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_44,"Thanks, Sweetie!"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_45,:-)
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_46,Really? I think this new way is cuter.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_47,"But, if that's what you prefer,"
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_48,I'll go back to my original way of speaking.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_49,Just a sec...
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_50,Rupee is inviting me out to go shopping.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_51,Have fun.
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_52,Thanks!
m_ex_anne_miraclefairy_03_53,Talk to you next time.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_1,"Hey Sweetie, what are you up to?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_2,I'm preparing presents.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_3,For who?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_4,Heehee...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_5,For...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_6,The upcoming Christmas event!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_7,There's gonna be a raffle where you can win awesome prizes.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_8,The only thing is...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_9,I've got to prepare 99 presents :/
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_10,I'm so tired :0
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_11,Anything I can do to help?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_12,"Don't worry, you've got this."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_13,You want to help?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_14,Really？
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_15,Oh...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_16,"Actually, no, it's okay."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_17,I need to give each of them my full attention.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_18,That way they're more meaningful.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_19,This is something I've gotta do myself.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_20,"But thanks anyway, Honey buns ♡"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_21,I hope so...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_22,That way they're more meaningful.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_23,I can do this!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_24,Best of luck.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_25,"Having said that,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_26,let me know if you have any good ideas.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_27,I've been racking my brain trying to come up with
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_28,99 different gift ideas.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_29,T_T
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_30,Will do.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_31,Much appreciated ☆
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_01_32,Until next time!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_1,Sweetie!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_2,"You've been working so hard lately,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_3,so I got you a little something.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_4,Where are you now?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_5,Are you busy?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_6,I was just resting.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_7,That's perfect!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_8,"So,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_9,what kind of present would you like?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_10,Psych! I already know what you want.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_11,"Actually, I really need a"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_12,"I know exactly how you think, Honey."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_13,"So, I got you..."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_14,Wait
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_15,Me! ♡
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_16,??
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_17,"All right, let's see it."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_18,I'm your present!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_19,"Hehe, just kidding."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_20,"Actually, I went out and got a whole bunch of new clothes for you."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_21,You'll be sporting the latest fashions from head to toe.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_22,I can't wait to see how you look in them! I'm on my way right now.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_23,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_24,I'm your
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_25,"Wait, what?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_26,Let's see it.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_27,See what?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_28,The present.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_29,You.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_30,Rupee doesn't reply for a long time.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_31,...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_32,"Are you still there, Sweetie?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_33,I'm still waiting for you.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_34,Oh!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_02_35,Okay! ♡♡♡♡♡
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_01,Phew!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_02,I'm pooped.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_03,Feels like I've been run over by a steamroller.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_04,Who knew handing out presents was such hard work?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_05,"Didn't it make you feel good, though?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_06,Super great.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_07,You deserve a present. What would you like?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_08,Darn right.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_09,And it's all because I did such a super duper job preparing.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_10,So...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_11,Do I get a present?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_12,What did you have in mind?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_13,Heh-heh.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_14,Guess☆
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_15,A seasonal fox-fur scarf?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_16,Some lingerie?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_17,I've already got one of those.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_18,"But even that would still be special,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_19,so long as it comes from you.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_20,I'd be over the moon if you got me something like that.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_21,!!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_22,"I'm not one to turn down nice lingerie,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_23,"but it seems to me you'll be getting just as much fun out of, if not more, than me."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_24,Nothing gets by you.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_25,"Anyway, you guessed wrong!"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_26,I was gonna make you keep guessing
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_27,"until you got it right,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_28,but I want it too bad.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_29,So I'm just gonna give you the answer.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_30,And that is...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_31,"C'mon, tell me!"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_32,The anticipation is killing me.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_33,"Drum roll, please..."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_34,24 hours with you!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_35,??
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_36,??
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_37,What? Don't you like it?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_38,I thought you were going to make me buy you something expensive.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_39,You can come see me anytime already.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_40,"Sweetie, your time is the most valuable thing of all."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_41,"You're really popular, you know?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_42,"I know that,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_43,but it's not the same.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_44,"It's not as... formal, I guess?"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_45,I feel a little awkward saying this.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_46,And a little worried.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_47,I may be revealing too much...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_48,Hmm.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_49,"If 24 hours isn't doable, then..."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_50,I'd be happy with 12 hours.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_51,I'll make time.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_52,Really???
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_53,"You're the best, Sweetie!"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_54,...
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_55,So how many hours do you think you can spare?
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_56,All 24.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_57,I can swing 12.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_58,!!!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_59,"To be honest, I'd have been happy even with 12 hours."
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_60,"But now that you promised,"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_61,no takebacks!
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_62,Okay! :D
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_63,I want your undivided attention
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_64,"for the full 12 hours, though!"
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_65,You got it.
m_ex_rupee_wintershopper_03_66,"Thanks, Sweetie ♡"
m_ex_viper_01_1,Is this Commander {AccountData.NickName}'s number?
m_ex_viper_01_2,Viper?
m_ex_viper_01_3,It is you! I got it right!
m_ex_viper_01_4,How did you get my number?
m_ex_viper_01_5,I did my research ;)
m_ex_viper_01_6,I just wanted to say hi
m_ex_viper_01_7,and wanted to talk about some personal stuff as well♡
m_ex_viper_01_8,"What do you mean by ""personal""?"
m_ex_viper_01_9,"Oh, you know..."
m_ex_viper_01_10,There's something I wanted to ask.
m_ex_viper_01_11,"No, that's not right."
m_ex_viper_01_12,I have a bunch of questions I want to ask!
m_ex_viper_01_13,What do you want to know?
m_ex_viper_01_14,"No beating around the bush with you, I see!"
m_ex_viper_01_15,Just stuff like... what are your hobbies?
m_ex_viper_01_16,What's your favorite food?
m_ex_viper_01_17,What turns you on? What turns you off?
m_ex_viper_01_18,Stuff like that.
m_ex_viper_01_19,This is starting to feel like an interview.
m_ex_viper_01_20,I suppose you could say that♡
m_ex_viper_01_21,??
m_ex_viper_01_22,"Unlike everyone else,"
m_ex_viper_01_23,I'm usually in the Outer Rim.
m_ex_viper_01_24,So I can't see you very often :'(
m_ex_viper_01_25,"I'd rather talk to you in person, but since I can't,"
m_ex_viper_01_26,I'll just have to send you messages here.
m_ex_viper_01_27,It's the only way I can get closer to you.
m_ex_viper_01_28,Why do you want to get closer to me?
m_ex_viper_01_29,"C'mon, don't be a stranger!"
m_ex_viper_01_30,"I'm one of your Nikkes now, Honey♡"
m_ex_viper_01_31,That name sounds... off.
m_ex_viper_01_32,Honey?
m_ex_viper_01_33,What? Don't you like it?
m_ex_viper_01_34,"I was just teasing, but you reacting like that"
m_ex_viper_01_35,makes me want to use it for real.
m_ex_viper_01_36,"Anyhoo, if you're ever curious about anything, send me a message, Honey."
m_ex_viper_01_37,"If you want to meet in person, even better :D"
m_ex_viper_01_38,Okay.
m_ex_viper_01_39,Until next time!
m_ex_viper_02_1,Honey♡♡♡ Are you up?
m_ex_viper_02_2,I enjoyed our date yesterday :)
m_ex_viper_02_3,"Sorry, but I can't remember much."
m_ex_viper_02_4,I'm not surprised.
m_ex_viper_02_5,You drank quite a bit.
m_ex_viper_02_6,It's possible that you're spreading yourself too thin.
m_ex_viper_02_7,Do you remember anything that happened?
m_ex_viper_02_8,"Of course, I remember everything. Hehe!"
m_ex_viper_02_9,I nearly couldn't get out of bed this morning
m_ex_viper_02_10,thanks to last night.
m_ex_viper_02_11,Why?
m_ex_viper_02_12,"It was my first time,"
m_ex_viper_02_13,"so I wanted to take a break,"
m_ex_viper_02_14,"but you were feeling so good,"
m_ex_viper_02_15,that you wouldn't let me.
m_ex_viper_02_16,What?!
m_ex_viper_02_17,Not that I didn't like it.
m_ex_viper_02_18,"I was just a little taken aback, that's all."
m_ex_viper_02_19,"I kept saying that I couldn't take much more,"
m_ex_viper_02_20,but you kept reassuring me that you'd take care of everything...
m_ex_viper_02_21,????????????????
m_ex_viper_02_22,You really can't remember anything?
m_ex_viper_02_23,"Yesterday, after we were done eating,"
m_ex_viper_02_24,"you took me back to your room, and we had some drinks. After that, we..."
m_ex_viper_02_25,we played that game all night. What was it called again?
m_ex_viper_02_26,Wait just a second.
m_ex_viper_02_27,I quickly check the activity log for Final Quest.
m_ex_viper_02_28,It shows that I was logged in all night.
m_ex_viper_02_29,Hehehe. Surprised?
m_ex_viper_02_30,You could say that.
m_ex_viper_02_31,"I'm just a beginner, so I'm not that skilled,"
m_ex_viper_02_32,"but you kept cheering me on, even though I kept dying."
m_ex_viper_02_33,I don't usually do that.
m_ex_viper_02_34,I'm usually much better at that game.
m_ex_viper_02_35,"Wow, really?"
m_ex_viper_02_36,I've never seen you so happy.
m_ex_viper_02_37,"Even though video games aren't usually my thing,"
m_ex_viper_02_38,I'm more than happy
m_ex_viper_02_39,to play with you once in a while.
m_ex_viper_02_40,That'd be nice.
m_ex_viper_02_41,Great!
m_ex_viper_02_42,"Come to think of it, you didn't get much sleep last night."
m_ex_viper_02_43,Aren't you tired?
m_ex_viper_02_44,Nothing I can't manage.
m_ex_viper_02_45,I'm fine. What about you?
m_ex_viper_02_46,That's good :)
m_ex_viper_02_47,I'm a bit tired
m_ex_viper_02_48,so I was planning on taking the day off.
m_ex_viper_02_49,Ok. Rest up.
m_ex_viper_02_50,Will do. My hips are super sore too.
m_ex_viper_02_51,"... All we did was play video games, right?"
m_ex_viper_02_52,Hehe.
m_ex_viper_02_53,See you later♡
m_ex_viper_03_1,"Honey, have you seen Jackal?"
m_ex_viper_03_2,"No, why?"
m_ex_viper_03_3,I've got a bone to pick with her.
m_ex_viper_03_4,"She made a mess of my closet,"
m_ex_viper_03_5,and I think
m_ex_viper_03_6,she snagged some of my favorite clothes.
m_ex_viper_03_7,My vanity is in shambles as well.
m_ex_viper_03_8,Sounds like she's taken an interest in her appearance.
m_ex_viper_03_9,Maybe she hit puberty?
m_ex_viper_03_10,Your guess is as good as mine.
m_ex_viper_03_11,"Actually, now that I think about it..."
m_ex_viper_03_12,you said something about how she ought to dress up more!
m_ex_viper_03_13,At least I think you did.
m_ex_viper_03_14,I did?
m_ex_viper_03_15,I'm almost positive.
m_ex_viper_03_16,Did you and Jackal go off and have fun together?
m_ex_viper_03_17,Yes.
m_ex_viper_03_18,No.
m_ex_viper_03_19,"Well, my room is a disaster zone,"
m_ex_viper_03_20,and I can't exactly say
m_ex_viper_03_21,"I'm over the moon,"
m_ex_viper_03_22,but at least you're happy.
m_ex_viper_03_23,Really?
m_ex_viper_03_24,"Considering the state that my room is in,"
m_ex_viper_03_25,I was at least hoping you'd gotten some fun out of all this.
m_ex_viper_03_26,Sorry :/
m_ex_viper_03_27,Don't be.
m_ex_viper_03_28,Thinking things through isn't exactly Jackal's forte.
m_ex_viper_03_29,I know you were merely making an innocent remark.
m_ex_viper_03_30,"Anyway, what should I do?"
m_ex_viper_03_31,I was saving those clothes for an important occasion.
m_ex_viper_03_32,"I've never even worn them before,"
m_ex_viper_03_33,not once.
m_ex_viper_03_34,I guess I can't show you now :(
m_ex_viper_03_35,What kind of occasion?
m_ex_viper_03_36,Like...
m_ex_viper_03_37,"our anniversary,"
m_ex_viper_03_38,or your birthday.
m_ex_viper_03_39,Well
m_ex_viper_03_40,what's happened has happened.
m_ex_viper_03_41,Now you need to choose something for me to wear!
m_ex_viper_03_42,Me?
m_ex_viper_03_43,"I wanted to pick an outfit for you anyway, so"
m_ex_viper_03_44,it makes sense if you're the one to choose it.
m_ex_viper_03_45,And that includes all the lingerie ;)
m_ex_viper_03_46,!!
m_ex_viper_03_47,Hehe! Just message me whenever you have some time.
m_ex_quency_01_1,"Counselor, what are you doing?"
m_ex_quency_01_2,whatareyoudoin? Whatareyoudoin?
m_ex_quency_01_3,Is something wrong?
m_ex_quency_01_4,Nothing. Am I not allowed to just say hi?
m_ex_quency_01_5,Does the center allow you to have a phone?
m_ex_quency_01_6,They sure do.
m_ex_quency_01_7,It's totally fine!
m_ex_quency_01_8,That's not what I've heard. Phones are forbidden there.
m_ex_quency_01_9,"In most cases, yes."
m_ex_quency_01_10,"But for me, having a phone is vital to"
m_ex_quency_01_11,"running my business,"
m_ex_quency_01_12,"figuring out new escape routes,"
m_ex_quency_01_13,and getting in touch with you as well.
m_ex_quency_01_14,How would they feel about you smuggling in a phone?
m_ex_quency_01_15,It wouldn't matter.
m_ex_quency_01_16,"If they confiscated it, I'd just get another one."
m_ex_quency_01_17,"If you need any help with anything, just let me know."
m_ex_quency_01_18,Let me know if you ever need a backup device.
m_ex_quency_01_19,You'd do that for me?
m_ex_quency_01_20,That's so sweet of you!
m_ex_quency_01_21,It is because you want to keep in touch with me?
m_ex_quency_01_22,That's right.
m_ex_quency_01_23,Nope.
m_ex_quency_01_24,Aw!
m_ex_quency_01_25,"I feel the same way, Counselor."
m_ex_quency_01_26,Ever heard of a thing called a little white lie...?
m_ex_quency_01_27,"Anyway, I appreciate you offering to help,"
m_ex_quency_01_28,but it's not too difficult for me to get my hands on a phone.
m_ex_quency_01_29,"Whoa, look at the time!"
m_ex_quency_01_30,"Time flies when I chat with you, Counselor."
m_ex_quency_01_31,Let's go out and have some croquettes sometime.
m_ex_quency_01_32,Sure thing.
m_ex_quency_02_1,Counselor.
m_ex_quency_02_2,Coooounssssserlllorrrr.
m_ex_quency_02_3,Anybody there?
m_ex_quency_02_4,Heeeeellooooo?
m_ex_quency_02_5,ooooooooo
m_ex_quency_02_6,ooooo
m_ex_quency_02_7,??
m_ex_quency_02_8,Finally!
m_ex_quency_02_9,Are you doing anything?
m_ex_quency_02_10,Can you fetch some goods for me?
m_ex_quency_02_11,"I had everything planned out for yesterday,"
m_ex_quency_02_12,but then one of my tunnels got blocked.
m_ex_quency_02_13,"I need to get a move on, or else the deal will be called off,"
m_ex_quency_02_14,and it'd take a good long while before I can dig another tunnel.
m_ex_quency_02_15,"I've got some primo items lined up today, super important."
m_ex_quency_02_16,Are you sure me picking them up is okay?
m_ex_quency_02_17,Do you want me to help clear the tunnel?
m_ex_quency_02_18,"Sure, it's no problem at all."
m_ex_quency_02_19,I don't think that'll be necessary.
m_ex_quency_02_20,Just picking up the merchandise will be more than enough.
m_ex_quency_02_21,I'll head to your room once I've got the tunnel cleared.
m_ex_quency_02_22,"Okay, just tell me when and where the drop-off is going to be."
m_ex_quency_02_23,... No reply.
m_ex_quency_02_24,All done!
m_ex_quency_02_25,??
m_ex_quency_02_26,That was easy.
m_ex_quency_02_27,??
m_ex_quency_02_28,I won't be needing you to go.
m_ex_quency_02_29,Problem solved!
m_ex_quency_02_30,Did you sort everything out?
m_ex_quency_02_31,Yep!
m_ex_quency_02_32,There was a thick plank in the way.
m_ex_quency_02_33,"I thought dealing with it would be a major headache,"
m_ex_quency_02_34,but I smashed it with one well-timed blow.
m_ex_quency_02_35,I shouldn't have worried!
m_ex_quency_02_36,Kinda feel a bit silly now :p
m_ex_quency_02_37,I just wonder who put the plank there in the first place...
m_ex_quency_02_38,"Anyway, gotta run. See ya!"
m_ex_quency_03_1,"Counselor, do you know of any places"
m_ex_quency_03_2,that have a bunch of bottle caps?
m_ex_quency_03_3,The garbage dumb.
m_ex_quency_03_4,My room.
m_ex_quency_03_5,I've already searched that place up and down.
m_ex_quency_03_6,"Enough plastic bottles to last two lifetimes, but no caps."
m_ex_quency_03_7,You mean the Commander's Room?
m_ex_quency_03_8,Are there many bottle caps there?
m_ex_quency_03_9,"Yep, because I drink a lot of soda."
m_ex_quency_03_10,"Ah, so you drink soda often?"
m_ex_quency_03_11,Save the bottle caps for me then.
m_ex_quency_03_12,I'll come get them later.
m_ex_quency_03_13,Are you running low on bottle caps?
m_ex_quency_03_14,Not really.
m_ex_quency_03_15,But you can never have too many.
m_ex_quency_03_16,"Think of it this way: you can never have too many credits, right?"
m_ex_quency_03_17,Right.
m_ex_quency_03_18,"Well, it's the same basic idea."
m_ex_quency_03_19,"In the Rehabilitation Center, bottle caps are our currency."
m_ex_quency_03_20,"So, if you save up a lot of extra bottle caps,"
m_ex_quency_03_21,remember to contact me.
m_ex_quency_03_22,Got it.
m_ex_quency_03_23,Thanks!
m_ex_jackal_01_1,Hehehe
m_ex_jackal_01_2,Commander!!!11
m_ex_jackal_01_3,I heard that you and I are going on an operation.
m_ex_jackal_01_4,Any idea what the mission objective is?
m_ex_jackal_01_5,Hopefully we'll get to do something fun.
m_ex_jackal_01_6,Did you have anything particular in mind?
m_ex_jackal_01_7,I...
m_ex_jackal_01_8,I want to do something I'm good at.
m_ex_jackal_01_9,I don't like doing things I'm bad at.
m_ex_jackal_01_10,It's boooorrring.
m_ex_jackal_01_11,Not many people enjoy doing things they're not good at.
m_ex_jackal_01_12,"Well, count me amongst them."
m_ex_jackal_01_13,It's way nicer doing things that you're good at.
m_ex_jackal_01_14,So what would that be for you?
m_ex_jackal_01_15,Running!!
m_ex_jackal_01_16,And biting!
m_ex_jackal_01_17,I've got a great set of chompers.
m_ex_jackal_01_18,And...
m_ex_jackal_01_19,listening to the Captain.
m_ex_jackal_01_20,"And, and"
m_ex_jackal_01_21,Er...
m_ex_jackal_01_22,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_jackal_01_23,Outwitting the A.C.P.U.
m_ex_jackal_01_24,Shooting weapons.
m_ex_jackal_01_25,"Yeah, that too."
m_ex_jackal_01_26,I'm a good runner.
m_ex_jackal_01_27,"Every time they see me, they chase after me."
m_ex_jackal_01_28,It's so annoying.
m_ex_jackal_01_29,"But I always outrun them, which is fun."
m_ex_jackal_01_30,"Yeah, that too."
m_ex_jackal_01_31,I'm a real crack shot.
m_ex_jackal_01_32,I like how stuff explodes when you shoot it.
m_ex_jackal_01_33,Is that what we're going to do?
m_ex_jackal_01_34,Right now?
m_ex_jackal_01_35,"Let's go, then!"
m_ex_jackal_01_36,Right now?
m_ex_jackal_01_37,"Yes, right now!"
m_ex_jackal_01_38,"Oh, wait."
m_ex_jackal_01_39,Just a sec.
m_ex_jackal_01_40,I'll go first.
m_ex_jackal_01_41,You follow.
m_ex_jackal_01_42,Wait a minute...
m_ex_jackal_01_43,... Jackal doesn't reply.
m_ex_jackal_02_1,"Commander, commander!!"
m_ex_jackal_02_2,I just messed with the A.C.P.U.!
m_ex_jackal_02_3,With Poli?
m_ex_jackal_02_4,With Miranda?
m_ex_jackal_02_5,??
m_ex_jackal_02_6,"No, I said I messed with the A.C.P.U."
m_ex_jackal_02_7,Poli and Miranda are the only two members of the A.C.P.U.
m_ex_jackal_02_8,Whatever.
m_ex_jackal_02_9,"I was hanging out in the gutters today,"
m_ex_jackal_02_10,when the A.C.P.U. started harassing me.
m_ex_jackal_02_11,What were you doing in the gutter?
m_ex_jackal_02_12,Finding stuff to chew on.
m_ex_jackal_02_13,There was this pipe made of reinforced plastic or something.
m_ex_jackal_02_14,"It was super tough, but if I bit down hard on it,"
m_ex_jackal_02_15,I could break it down into smaller pieces.
m_ex_jackal_02_16,It was awesome!
m_ex_jackal_02_17,Water started gushing out everywhere.
m_ex_jackal_02_18,"Made a heck of a lotta noise, too."
m_ex_jackal_02_19,Sounds like you had fun.
m_ex_jackal_02_20,"So there I was minding my own business, when the A.C.P.U. showed up."
m_ex_jackal_02_21,"They ran over and started shouting at me,"
m_ex_jackal_02_22,so I stole their hats.
m_ex_jackal_02_23,You what?
m_ex_jackal_02_24,I stole their hats and ran off.
m_ex_jackal_02_25,"They tried to chase after me, but I ran for a loooong time."
m_ex_jackal_02_26,They almost got me a couple times.
m_ex_jackal_02_27,"I used to hate those two,"
m_ex_jackal_02_28,but it was fun horsing around with them today.
m_ex_jackal_02_29,What about their hats?
m_ex_jackal_02_30,I'm wearing them right now.
m_ex_jackal_02_31,Both of 'em.
m_ex_jackal_02_32,... I can feel a migraine coming on.
m_ex_jackal_02_33,You have to give them back.
m_ex_jackal_02_34,Hmm???
m_ex_jackal_02_35,Why??
m_ex_jackal_02_36,"If I keep these, I'll be able to keep having fun with Miranda and Poli."
m_ex_jackal_02_37,I hope they come to hang out with me soon.
m_ex_jackal_02_38,"In the meantime, do you want to hang out, Commander?"
m_ex_jackal_02_39,"Jackal, give them back."
m_ex_jackal_02_40,No.
m_ex_jackal_02_41,Why do you keep pestering me about the hats?
m_ex_jackal_02_42,Don't you like me having a fun time with the A.C.P.U.?
m_ex_jackal_02_43,"No, I don't."
m_ex_jackal_02_44,Why not??!!
m_ex_jackal_02_45,Don't you want me to be happy!??!!?
m_ex_jackal_02_46,I want you all to myself.
m_ex_jackal_02_47,Huh???
m_ex_jackal_02_48,Ah-hah!
m_ex_jackal_02_49,I knew it!!!
m_ex_jackal_02_50,Are you jealous????
m_ex_jackal_02_51,Yes.
m_ex_jackal_02_52,Heh-heh.
m_ex_jackal_02_53,Gotcha. I'll be right back once I return these.
m_ex_jackal_02_54,"But in return,"
m_ex_jackal_02_55,I want you to do me a favor.
m_ex_jackal_02_56,I want you to...
m_ex_jackal_02_57,run your fingers through my hair 100 times!
m_ex_jackal_02_58,Only 100 times? That's easy.
m_ex_jackal_02_59,All right!
m_ex_jackal_02_60,I'll be back soon.
m_ex_jackal_02_61,... I may have to apologize to Poli and Miranda next time I see them.
m_ex_jackal_03_1,Commanger.
m_ex_jackal_03_2,Watcha doin'?
m_ex_jackal_03_3,Resting.
m_ex_jackal_03_4,Yeah?

m_ex_jackal_03_29,Got it.
m_ex_jackal_03_30,Hehehe
m_ex_jackal_03_31,Tatses great.
m_ex_sin_01_1,Counselor!
m_ex_sin_01_2,I've finally got a phone!
m_ex_sin_01_3,I knew there was no way I could ever have one while I was in the Rehabilitation Center. > <
m_ex_sin_01_4,It's nice to hear you speaking without the converter.
m_ex_sin_01_5,You're telling me!
m_ex_sin_01_6,"The guards over there can't go five minutes without checking their phones,"
m_ex_sin_01_7,yet inmates aren't allowed to have phones at all. So unfair!
m_ex_sin_01_8,How are you feeling now that you're out?
m_ex_sin_01_9,Haha!
m_ex_sin_01_10,I feel amazing!
m_ex_sin_01_11,I'm free at last!
m_ex_sin_01_12,I was so over everyone at the center.
m_ex_sin_01_13,It was starting to get seriously boring.
m_ex_sin_01_14,"Now that I'm surrounded by all these young and beautiful people,"
m_ex_sin_01_15,it's like I've got a new lease on life.
m_ex_sin_01_16,The world is my oyster!
m_ex_sin_01_17,"In that case, what are you hoping to accomplish next?"
m_ex_sin_01_18,"Making new friends,"
m_ex_sin_01_19,of course.
m_ex_sin_01_20,I was just speaking to everyone a while ago.
m_ex_sin_01_21,They're all super chill.
m_ex_sin_01_22,"I still haven't fully come out of my shell,"
m_ex_sin_01_23,but I'm really looking forward to getting to know everyone better.
m_ex_sin_01_24,I'm glad to hear you say that.
m_ex_sin_01_25,"Just try and stay out of trouble, okay?"
m_ex_sin_01_26,You make it sound like
m_ex_sin_01_27,"you were worried about me before, haha!"
m_ex_sin_01_28,I hope you won't stop thinking about me now that I'm adjusting so well.
m_ex_sin_01_29,"After all, it's always nice being around someone who has your back."
m_ex_sin_01_30,Don't worry about me.
m_ex_sin_01_31,"As long as we all are in cahoots, there won't be any trouble."
m_ex_sin_01_32,I'll count you in if we decide to get up to anything fun.
m_ex_sin_01_33,Hehehe.
m_ex_sin_01_34,I'll talk to you later.
m_ex_sin_01_35,XOXO
m_ex_sin_02_1,Counselor! ((((((> <))))))
m_ex_sin_02_2,Guilty and I are hatching up one heck of a scheme.
m_ex_sin_02_3,You want in?
m_ex_sin_02_4,"What does this so-called ""scheme"" entail?"
m_ex_sin_02_5,Hehe...
m_ex_sin_02_6,Let me tell you...
m_ex_sin_02_7,... Sin doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_sin_02_8,???
m_ex_sin_02_9,"Whoops, sorry!"
m_ex_sin_02_10,I was talking with Guilty.
m_ex_sin_02_11,Have you ever heard of giving out free hugs?
m_ex_sin_02_12,Yes.
m_ex_sin_02_13,"Sure, it's when people stand on the street and offer hugs to passersby."
m_ex_sin_02_14,Yep! I figured you would know.
m_ex_sin_02_15,Most people are a bit apprehensive
m_ex_sin_02_16,about ex-inmates who have just been released from the Rehabilitation Center.
m_ex_sin_02_17,"Guilty and I figured that if we go around giving people hugs,"
m_ex_sin_02_18,it might help change any preconceptions people have about us.
m_ex_sin_02_19,"You two aren't up to anything nefarious, are you?"
m_ex_sin_02_20,Hmm?
m_ex_sin_02_21,... Sin doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_sin_02_22,Sin？
m_ex_sin_02_23,"Oh, hey!"
m_ex_sin_02_24,"Actually, the whole giving out hugs thing wasn't our first idea."
m_ex_sin_02_25,"We figured that since you wouldn't discriminate against any ex-inmates,"
m_ex_sin_02_26,"you'd feel the same way about our plan, and we wanted to get your thoughts on it."
m_ex_sin_02_27,Hmm...
m_ex_sin_02_28,"So maybe in the end, free hugs are the way to go."
m_ex_sin_02_29,"Thank you for enlightening us, Counselor. Extra points for you!!!"
m_ex_sin_02_30,Wait a minute.
m_ex_sin_02_31,What?
m_ex_sin_02_32,"Guilty's ""hugs"" could end up crushing someone."
m_ex_sin_02_33,Haha.
m_ex_sin_02_34,I know that.
m_ex_sin_02_35,"In the name of overcoming prejudice, that's a risk we'll have to take."
m_ex_sin_02_36,Wouldn't it be better if you...
m_ex_sin_02_37,"This way, it adds a little excitement to the mix."
m_ex_sin_02_38,I think you'd be better off coming up with an alternative plan.
m_ex_sin_02_39,... Sin doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_sin_02_40,Maybe.
m_ex_sin_02_41,But we've already started making preparations.
m_ex_sin_02_42,It'd be a shame to give up now.
m_ex_sin_02_43,"Plus, now that I've heard you out, Counselor,"
m_ex_sin_02_44,we're back on track.
m_ex_sin_02_45,"Actually, Guilty wants to stick to the original plan, too."
m_ex_sin_02_46,And what would that be?
m_ex_sin_02_47,She'll be delighted to know that you agree.
m_ex_sin_02_48,So if we were to quit now...
m_ex_sin_02_49,"Wait, what's the original plan?"
m_ex_sin_02_50,Guilty will give everyone a great big bear hug!
m_ex_sin_02_51,... And then what?
m_ex_sin_02_52,I'll gather 10 people and get back to you tomorrow morning.
m_ex_sin_02_53,"Get ready to have fun, Counselor!!!! ((((> <))))"
m_ex_sin_02_54,Hehehe
m_ex_sin_02_55,Hahahahahaha
m_ex_sin_03_1,All work and no play make the Commander a dull boy!
m_ex_sin_03_2,Time for a surprise round of Would You Rather?
m_ex_sin_03_3,"Take off my converter, or spend 10 years in the Rehabilitation Center."
m_ex_sin_03_4,"Option 1, of course."
m_ex_sin_03_5,"Option 1 would be irresponsible of me, so option 2."
m_ex_sin_03_6,Haha
m_ex_sin_03_7,That's my preferred option as well.
m_ex_sin_03_8,"If you had to choose, being destroyed mentally beats being destroyed physically any day of the week."
m_ex_sin_03_9,No kidding! ㅇvㅇ
m_ex_sin_03_10,No offense Counselor but you wouldn't last a day in the center.
m_ex_sin_03_11,You'd be wearing your underwear for a hat before it was time for chow.
m_ex_sin_03_12,You'd really rather subject yourself to all that rather than remove my converter?
m_ex_sin_03_13,I didn't realize you had such strong convictions.
m_ex_sin_03_14,"All right, next question."
m_ex_sin_03_15,"Take off my converter, or be sent to the surface for 20 years."
m_ex_sin_03_16,Option 1.
m_ex_sin_03_17,"Option 2, because it's bound to happen sooner or later."
m_ex_sin_03_18,Looool
m_ex_sin_03_19,Option 1 is always the way to go.
m_ex_sin_03_20,"If you chose option 2, you'd be trapped above ground for the rest of your life."
m_ex_sin_03_21,Having to spend every day hanging on by a thread... you can hardly call that life.
m_ex_sin_03_22,Whaaaa?!?!
m_ex_sin_03_23,"Why are you so pessimistic, Counselor?"
m_ex_sin_03_24,How can someone responsible for countless Nikkes' mental health
m_ex_sin_03_25,be such a downer?
m_ex_sin_03_26,"That's it, 15 points deducted!"
m_ex_sin_03_27,That'll teach you to be more positive.
m_ex_sin_03_28,"All right, last question."
m_ex_sin_03_29,"Take off my converter, or become Syuen's toady for life."
m_ex_sin_03_30,Option 1.
m_ex_sin_03_31,?
m_ex_sin_03_32,You don't even want to think it over?
m_ex_sin_03_33,No. Option 1.
m_ex_sin_03_34,Haha!
m_ex_sin_03_35,I see!
m_ex_sin_03_36,"Choose option 2, and you'd be an underling, but at least you'd be working for the CEO of Missilis."
m_ex_sin_03_37,That's bound to come with some perks attached.
m_ex_sin_03_38,I'm surprised you picked the first option without any hesitation.
m_ex_sin_03_39,"Then again, I suppose taking off my converter would be preferable"
m_ex_sin_03_40,to spending the rest of your days under someone's thumb.
m_ex_sin_03_41,"After all, it's just a silly little mask all! Hehe!"
m_ex_sin_03_42,"Anyway, Counselor((((((>▣<))))))"
m_ex_sin_03_43,I hope you've learned something today.
m_ex_sin_03_44,Have a nice day!
m_ex_sin_03_45,XOXO
m_ex_guilty_01_1,"Councilor. No, that's not right..."
m_ex_guilty_01_2,??
m_ex_guilty_01_3,Counsel... no. Buddy.
m_ex_guilty_01_4,Guilty？
m_ex_guilty_01_5,Hey buddy.
m_ex_guilty_01_6,Buddy?
m_ex_guilty_01_7,Hello.
m_ex_guilty_01_8,I'm using voice-to-text.
m_ex_guilty_01_9,It's hard.
m_ex_guilty_01_10,It's not terribly accurate.
m_ex_guilty_01_11,I'm surprised you could make sense of all that.
m_ex_guilty_01_12,Thanks so much.
m_ex_guilty_01_13,"I'm using voice-to-text, and I'm kind of struggling."
m_ex_guilty_01_14,Why are you using voice-to-text?
m_ex_guilty_01_15,Why. Question mark.
m_ex_guilty_01_16,Because I'm tied up.
m_ex_guilty_01_17,Sorry. I guess it was a silly question.
m_ex_guilty_01_18,Yeah.
m_ex_guilty_01_19,But it's good now.
m_ex_guilty_01_20,There are times when it works okay.
m_ex_guilty_01_21,But there are also times that.
m_ex_guilty_01_22,It socks.
m_ex_guilty_01_23,Socks. Sax. Not sax.
m_ex_guilty_01_24,It sucks?
m_ex_guilty_01_25,I know what you're trying to say.
m_ex_guilty_01_26,"Yes, that's it."
m_ex_guilty_01_27,I'm just glad you understand me.
m_ex_guilty_01_28,"Still, this is starting to really tick me off."
m_ex_guilty_01_29,This is hardly what I'd call hand. Handy.
m_ex_guilty_01_30,It's making me want to pull my hair out.
m_ex_guilty_01_31,It's so annoying.
m_ex_guilty_01_32,Did you text me to say that you've got a phone?
m_ex_guilty_01_33,Yeah.
m_ex_guilty_01_34,"Just wanted to send a quick message to let you know,"
m_ex_guilty_01_35,But.
m_ex_guilty_01_36,It's difficult.
m_ex_guilty_01_37,No need to send more. I'll visit you sometime.
m_ex_guilty_01_38,"Yeah, I don't want to send any more."
m_ex_guilty_01_39,It's driving mean.
m_ex_guilty_01_40,Driving me madam.
m_ex_guilty_01_41,Really.
m_ex_guilty_01_42,Ah.
m_ex_guilty_01_43,I'm so pissed.
m_ex_guilty_01_44,I'm gonna smash this phone in two seconds.
m_ex_guilty_01_45,Bye.
m_ex_guilty_01_46,"Okay, try not to get too frustrated."
m_ex_guilty_02_1,Sin said that
m_ex_guilty_02_2,"once she was able to text,"
m_ex_guilty_02_3,she felt freer than she ever had.
m_ex_guilty_02_4,"Apparently, according to her, it's different for me though."
m_ex_guilty_02_5,"If I have to resort to texting,"
m_ex_guilty_02_6,I feel that I can't properly express myself.
m_ex_guilty_02_7,"Do you feel the same, Counselor?"
m_ex_guilty_02_8,"Well, voice recognition software is getting better and better."
m_ex_guilty_02_9,"Yeah, I've used it a couple times."
m_ex_guilty_02_10,It's a bit all over the place.
m_ex_guilty_02_11,Sometimes it can really irritate mean.
m_ex_guilty_02_12,Every takes me.
m_ex_guilty_02_13,Ah.
m_ex_guilty_02_14,See? I'm getting mad right now.
m_ex_guilty_02_15,It's okay.
m_ex_guilty_02_16,All right.
m_ex_guilty_02_17,But.
m_ex_guilty_02_18,Sin has also been irritating me.
m_ex_guilty_02_19,"Every time she gets one of my messages, all she does is laugh at me."
m_ex_guilty_02_20,I want revenge.
m_ex_guilty_02_21,I'm gonna squeeze her as hard as I can.
m_ex_guilty_02_22,You can't do that.
m_ex_guilty_02_23,Calm down.
m_ex_guilty_02_24,Why not?
m_ex_guilty_02_25,What?
m_ex_guilty_02_26,Are you trying to defend Sin?
m_ex_guilty_02_27,You should be on my side!
m_ex_guilty_02_28,You don't really want to do that to her.
m_ex_guilty_02_29,I know...
m_ex_guilty_02_30,But I am angry.
m_ex_guilty_02_31,I want raven.
m_ex_guilty_02_32,I want revenge.
m_ex_guilty_02_33,Got any ideas?
m_ex_guilty_02_34,Grab Sin's phone.
m_ex_guilty_02_35,! Exclamation mark.
m_ex_guilty_02_36,That'd be like robbing her of her freedom!
m_ex_guilty_02_37,"Counselor, you're so smart."
m_ex_guilty_02_38,This is a brilliant ideal.
m_ex_guilty_02_39,Brilliant ideal? Haha
m_ex_guilty_02_40,"Counselor,"
m_ex_guilty_02_41,are you laughing at me?
m_ex_guilty_02_42,I would never do such a thing.
m_ex_guilty_02_43,That's a good idea.
m_ex_guilty_02_44,I'll get a revan with her phone.
m_ex_guilty_02_45,Revenge.
m_ex_guilty_02_46,Than you.
m_ex_guilty_02_47,Tank you.
m_ex_guilty_02_48,Thank you.
m_ex_guilty_03_1,Voice recognition.
m_ex_guilty_03_2,So hard.
m_ex_guilty_03_3,Should I continue using it?
m_ex_guilty_03_4,??
m_ex_guilty_03_5,"Where are you now, Counselor?"
m_ex_guilty_03_6,I want to see you.
m_ex_guilty_03_7,Should I continue texting?
m_ex_guilty_03_8,Guilty??
m_ex_guilty_03_9,Tied up and lying down like this.
m_ex_guilty_03_10,Feels so dad.
m_ex_guilty_03_11,Feels so bad. Damn.
m_ex_guilty_03_12,Why am I the only Nikke
m_ex_guilty_03_13,who has to go through all this nonsense?
m_ex_guilty_03_14,I might as well be back in the Rehabilitation Center.
m_ex_guilty_03_15,Did you not check your messages?
m_ex_guilty_03_16,I feel like destroying something.
m_ex_guilty_03_17,Or giving something a good squeeze.
m_ex_guilty_03_18,What?
m_ex_guilty_03_19,You feel like doing something?
m_ex_guilty_03_20,I need to get out.
m_ex_guilty_03_21,"Where are you, Counselor?"
m_ex_guilty_03_22,When can you come over?
m_ex_guilty_03_23,I need some air.
m_ex_guilty_03_24,Should I bust out of here?
m_ex_guilty_03_25,Get. Aw of here.
m_ex_guilty_03_26,Get out of here.
m_ex_guilty_03_27,Okay.
m_ex_guilty_03_28,I'm getting out.
m_ex_guilty_03_29,Right now.
m_ex_guilty_03_30,I'll go find some other Nikkes
m_ex_guilty_03_31,and give each of them a big hug.
m_ex_guilty_03_32,"Guilty, calm down!!"
m_ex_guilty_03_33,Hello? Guilty?
m_ex_guilty_03_34,Hmm?
m_ex_guilty_03_35,What's that?
m_ex_guilty_03_36,My screen just lit up.
m_ex_guilty_03_37,Apparently it's a message from you.
m_ex_guilty_03_38,So now I'm sending this in response.
m_ex_guilty_03_39,And it does this automatically? That's amazing.
m_ex_guilty_03_40,Haven't you checked my messages?
m_ex_guilty_03_41,No.
m_ex_guilty_03_42,I'm getting out.
m_ex_guilty_03_43,I'm going crazy.
m_ex_guilty_03_44,Stir-crazy.
m_ex_guilty_03_45,I'm the only Nikke who has to go through this.
m_ex_guilty_03_46,I wanna go crush some Nikkes.
m_ex_guilty_03_47,Don't do it.
m_ex_guilty_03_48,Why not?
m_ex_guilty_03_49,I'm so bored.
m_ex_guilty_03_50,I'm coming to you now.
m_ex_guilty_03_51,Right now?
m_ex_guilty_03_52,Right away? Question mark.
m_ex_guilty_03_53,Yes. Right away.
m_ex_guilty_03_54,Got it
m_ex_guilty_03_55,See you some.
m_ex_guilty_03_56,See you soon.
m_ex_realkindness_01_1,Wow!
m_ex_realkindness_01_2,Is this our chatroom?
m_ex_realkindness_01_3,Sin? Guilty? Are you here as well?
m_ex_realkindness_01_4,Yep! ((^^))
m_ex_realkindness_01_5,Do you really think all of us staying together like this is a good idea?
m_ex_realkindness_01_6,Aren't they afraid we'll start a revolt or something? :p
m_ex_realkindness_01_7,"Yeah, big oversight on their part."
m_ex_realkindness_01_8,"If we were in the Rehabilitation Center, they'd separate us straight away."
m_ex_realkindness_01_9,Maybe the Counselor is overly trusting?
m_ex_realkindness_01_10,Or just underestimating us?
m_ex_realkindness_01_11,It's because I trust you.
m_ex_realkindness_01_12,I'm glad that
m_ex_realkindness_01_13,you trust me.
m_ex_realkindness_01_14,Guilty? When did you get here?
m_ex_realkindness_01_15,I didn't hear you make any noise.
m_ex_realkindness_01_16,I thought you were not in our room.
m_ex_realkindness_01_17,Voice recognition.
m_ex_realkindness_01_18,It's sow.
m_ex_realkindness_01_19,Slob.
m_ex_realkindness_01_20,Slow.
m_ex_realkindness_01_21,Is voice recognition hard to use?
m_ex_realkindness_01_22,Are you too far away from your phone to use the keyboard?
m_ex_realkindness_01_23,Would you like me to buy you a headset?
m_ex_realkindness_01_24,Head three?
m_ex_realkindness_01_25,"Whoa, you've got three heads?"
m_ex_realkindness_01_26,Are you a Cerberus??!! (> <) (^^) (-3-)
m_ex_realkindness_01_27,"Cerberus, too hilarious lol"
m_ex_realkindness_01_28,"Enough kidding around, all of you!"
m_ex_realkindness_01_29,"Yeah, can it you two."
m_ex_realkindness_01_30,"Wait, a headset"
m_ex_realkindness_01_31,would have a microphone attached to it!
m_ex_realkindness_01_32,That'd make voice-to-text way easier!
m_ex_realkindness_01_33,"Get me three bottle caps, and I'll have that for you in no time."
m_ex_realkindness_01_34,Three bottle cabs?
m_ex_realkindness_01_35,Cabs
m_ex_realkindness_01_36,Guilty's asking you to be her cabbie girl! ((((((> <))))))
m_ex_realkindness_01_37,"Sorry Guilty, but it is pretty funny, haha"
m_ex_realkindness_01_38,You made me laugh so hard!
m_ex_realkindness_01_39,I don't want to use SMS.
m_ex_realkindness_01_40,Let's meet.
m_ex_realkindness_01_41,No.
m_ex_realkindness_01_42,You'll squeeze the life out of me!
m_ex_realkindness_01_43,So let's meet and talk.
m_ex_realkindness_01_44,10 points to Counselor
m_ex_realkindness_01_45,for helping us chat via SMS :D
m_ex_realkindness_01_46,You really shouldn't laugh at Guilty.
m_ex_realkindness_01_47,Cabs kek
m_ex_realkindness_01_48,Counselor？
m_ex_realkindness_01_49,Sorry.
m_ex_realkindness_01_50,"Oops, Guilty is going to blow a gasket if this keeps up."
m_ex_realkindness_01_51,I gotta go!
m_ex_realkindness_01_52,"See you, everyone!"
m_ex_realkindness_01_53,"Ok, be sure to meat offline!"
m_ex_realkindness_01_54,"Ok, be sure to meat offline! (> <))))!!!!"
m_ex_realkindness_01_55,Lmao
m_ex_realkindness_01_56,Damn.
m_ex_realkindness_01_57,I might need to comfort Guilty later.
m_ex_realkindness_02_1,"Guys, the weather has been fantastic the past few days."
m_ex_realkindness_02_2,It's time for some outdoor activities!
m_ex_realkindness_02_3,Let's go for a picnic.
m_ex_realkindness_02_4,Pic Nikke？
m_ex_realkindness_02_5,Pic? Nikke？
m_ex_realkindness_02_6,"Yeah, pic Nikke."
m_ex_realkindness_02_7,Argh...
m_ex_realkindness_02_8,Can't you just ignore my typos?
m_ex_realkindness_02_9,"Hehe, will do."
m_ex_realkindness_02_10,"Guilty, are you the only one still in your room?"
m_ex_realkindness_02_11,What?
m_ex_realkindness_02_12,I'm already outside.
m_ex_realkindness_02_13,Quincy is outside too.
m_ex_realkindness_02_14,What about Counselor?
m_ex_realkindness_02_15,I'm outside too.
m_ex_realkindness_02_16,I'm in the Commander's Room.
m_ex_realkindness_02_17,What? Why is everyone outside?
m_ex_realkindness_02_18,What about me?
m_ex_realkindness_02_19,Good.
m_ex_realkindness_02_20,"If you were outside as well,"
m_ex_realkindness_02_21,I'd be super mad.
m_ex_realkindness_02_22,"Wow, the voice-to-text is super accurate all of a sudden!"
m_ex_realkindness_02_23,Don't be upset.
m_ex_realkindness_02_24,That's why I suggested that we all go on a picnic.
m_ex_realkindness_02_25,"Where do you want to go, Guilty?"
m_ex_realkindness_02_26,I
m_ex_realkindness_02_27,As long as it's outside.
m_ex_realkindness_02_28,"With you, Counselor."
m_ex_realkindness_02_29,Anywhere is fine.
m_ex_realkindness_02_30,Oh.
m_ex_realkindness_02_31,You poor thing.
m_ex_realkindness_02_32,Poor Guilty.
m_ex_realkindness_02_33,Pool Guilty. TTT_TTT
m_ex_realkindness_02_34,I don't need your pity.
m_ex_realkindness_02_35,You guys are the worst.
m_ex_realkindness_02_36,"Geez, you don't have to rip our heads off!"
m_ex_realkindness_02_37,"I knew this would happen,"
m_ex_realkindness_02_38,so I already laid a picnic blanket out in the park at the Outpost.
m_ex_realkindness_02_39,"I also bought some Splendamin. Mint chocolate, your favorite!(((> <)))"
m_ex_realkindness_02_40,Mint chocolate?
m_ex_realkindness_02_41,I hate that flavor!
m_ex_realkindness_02_42,I'll prepare something on my own.
m_ex_realkindness_02_43,Really?
m_ex_realkindness_02_44,Really!! -3-
m_ex_realkindness_02_45,That's nice.
m_ex_realkindness_02_46,Hehehe
m_ex_realkindness_02_47,"Okay, let's meet at the park."
m_ex_realkindness_02_48,"Counselor, why don't you and Guilty come together?"
m_ex_realkindness_02_49,Sure.
m_ex_realkindness_02_50,! Exclamation mark.
m_ex_realkindness_02_51,"Ok, be quick, Counselor."
m_ex_realkindness_02_52,On my way.
m_ex_realkindness_02_53,"I know we were all just making fun of each other,"
m_ex_realkindness_02_54,but this is all so touching!
m_ex_realkindness_02_55,It's so rare that Guilty has a chance to go out with us.
m_ex_realkindness_02_56,I'm starting to feel emotional!
m_ex_realkindness_02_57,Yea! It feels nice!
m_ex_realkindness_02_58,"See you later, guys!"
m_ex_cocoa_01_1,Greetings!
m_ex_cocoa_01_2,"This is the head maid of Maid Cafe,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_3,"Cocoa, at your service."
m_ex_cocoa_01_4,So much formality.
m_ex_cocoa_01_5,"A maid must be formal at all times,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_6,most of all when she is introducing herself to others.
m_ex_cocoa_01_7,At least that's what Ade told me.
m_ex_cocoa_01_8,How very professional of you.
m_ex_cocoa_01_9,What a polite little munchkin you are.
m_ex_cocoa_01_10,But of course.
m_ex_cocoa_01_11,Being a maid is my profession.
m_ex_cocoa_01_12,I must follow all necessary protocols.
m_ex_cocoa_01_13,I'm no munchkin!
m_ex_cocoa_01_14,"Ever since I set out to become a professional maid,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_15,such mawkish terms of endearment
m_ex_cocoa_01_16,have become a thing of the past for me.
m_ex_cocoa_01_17,"All right then. Anyway, what made you reach out to me over Blabla?"
m_ex_cocoa_01_18,To appoint you as master.
m_ex_cocoa_01_19,??
m_ex_cocoa_01_20,Boss Mirrorball informed me that
m_ex_cocoa_01_21,"I am now in your employ,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_22,which makes you my master.
m_ex_cocoa_01_23,"In exchange for looking after me,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_24,I will do my utmost to serve you in any way possible.
m_ex_cocoa_01_25,"All right, I will do my best."
m_ex_cocoa_01_26,Great.
m_ex_cocoa_01_27,"You know, technically I'm not supposed to do this..."
m_ex_cocoa_01_28,"But next time you come to our cafe,"
m_ex_cocoa_01_29,I'll be sure to give you some extra ketchup.
m_ex_cocoa_01_30,I can get away with it because I'm the head maid.
m_ex_cocoa_01_31,Just don't say anything to Ade or Soda.
m_ex_cocoa_01_32,Got it.
m_ex_cocoa_01_33,I'll have to stop by the Maid Cafe sometime soon.
m_ex_cocoa_02_1,"Master,"
m_ex_cocoa_02_2,what are you doing?
m_ex_cocoa_02_3,Are you busy?
m_ex_cocoa_02_4,Can we talk?
m_ex_cocoa_02_5,"Sure, what's up?"
m_ex_cocoa_02_6,Would you like to play the Cipher Game with me?
m_ex_cocoa_02_7,Cipher Game?
m_ex_cocoa_02_8,Yeah.
m_ex_cocoa_02_9,Let's begin!
m_ex_cocoa_02_10,You have to imagine that our communications are under the surveillance of
m_ex_cocoa_02_11,the Central Government.
m_ex_cocoa_02_12,So we have to use a secret language to communicate.
m_ex_cocoa_02_13,"I'll tell you how to play. Pay attention, now!"
m_ex_cocoa_02_14,Cocoa = Acoco
m_ex_cocoa_02_15,Customer = Crow
m_ex_cocoa_02_16,The Cafe = Nest
m_ex_cocoa_02_17,Ketchup = Bird dropping
m_ex_cocoa_02_18,That's all for now.
m_ex_cocoa_02_19,I'll try to remember.
m_ex_cocoa_02_20,Okay.
m_ex_cocoa_02_21,Then...
m_ex_cocoa_02_22,Let's begin.
m_ex_cocoa_02_23,There are 2 crows in the nest now.
m_ex_cocoa_02_24,"When they were ordering omelet rice,"
m_ex_cocoa_02_25,they wanted me to use bird droppings to draw one of those Transmorpher robots.
m_ex_cocoa_02_26,But Acoco don't know the first thing about Transmorphers.
m_ex_cocoa_02_27,I was hoping you could give me a few pointers.
m_ex_cocoa_02_28,Model it after Exia.
m_ex_cocoa_02_29,Model it after Laplace.
m_ex_cocoa_02_30,Exia isn't a robot.
m_ex_cocoa_02_31,She's a Nikke.
m_ex_cocoa_02_32,Laplace isn't a Transmorpher.
m_ex_cocoa_02_33,She's just a Nikke who can alter her appearance.
m_ex_cocoa_02_34,"Sorry, I was just kidding."
m_ex_cocoa_02_35,...
m_ex_cocoa_02_36,It seems you don't know anything either.
m_ex_cocoa_02_37,I'll just have to improvise.
m_ex_cocoa_02_38,Cocoa doesn't respond for a while.
m_ex_cocoa_02_39,"What did you end up drawing, Acoco?"
m_ex_cocoa_02_40,Your face.
m_ex_cocoa_02_41,With a robot body.
m_ex_cocoa_02_42,!!
m_ex_cocoa_02_43,"I just don't get Transmorphers,"
m_ex_cocoa_02_44,so I decided to draw my favorite face.
m_ex_cocoa_02_45,"The crows said they liked it, at any rate."
m_ex_cocoa_02_46,"In fact, they want another one."
m_ex_cocoa_02_47,Pardon me.
m_ex_cocoa_02_48,"I'd love to keep playing the Cipher Game with you,"
m_ex_cocoa_02_49,but I've got to go squirt out some more bird droppings for them.
m_ex_cocoa_02_50,I'm honored to be chosen as your muse.
m_ex_cocoa_02_51,I never gave you permission to use my likeness...
m_ex_cocoa_02_52,That's great!
m_ex_cocoa_02_53,I'm having a great time drawing you.
m_ex_cocoa_02_54,Huh?
m_ex_cocoa_02_55,What are you talking about?
m_ex_cocoa_02_56,Nothing...
m_ex_cocoa_02_57,"Well, gotta run."
m_ex_cocoa_02_58,"Cipher Game,"
m_ex_cocoa_02_59,over.
m_ex_cocoa_03_1,"This letter can be traced all the way back to the surface. It goes around and around every year, delivering fortune and prosperity to everyone who receives it.
After getting this letter, you have 7 days to send it to someone else."
m_ex_cocoa_03_2,You must send the letter to 7 people who could use a bit of luck in their lives.
m_ex_cocoa_03_3,"Disseminate this letter and you have 7 years of good fortune.
If you don't, you will be down on your luck for 3 years."
m_ex_cocoa_03_4,"This letter cannot be ignored, so don't forget: 7 letters to 7 lucky recipients."
m_ex_cocoa_03_5,"You may think it's a bit inconvenient, but look on the bright side: There's 7 years of good luck waiting at the end of all this!"
m_ex_cocoa_03_6,??
m_ex_cocoa_03_7,I was told that this is a lucky letter.
m_ex_cocoa_03_8,Something tells me that isn't exactly true.
m_ex_cocoa_03_9,I'm starting to feel the same way.
m_ex_cocoa_03_10,I heard that someone earned 2 billion credits
m_ex_cocoa_03_11,after sending this letter out.
m_ex_cocoa_03_12,Have you already sent it to 7 people?
m_ex_cocoa_03_13,Yes. You're the last one.
m_ex_cocoa_03_14,Who else did you send it to?
m_ex_cocoa_03_15,"Ade, Soda,"
m_ex_cocoa_03_16,and some customers of the Maid Cafe.
m_ex_cocoa_03_17,You sent it to the customers?
m_ex_cocoa_03_18,I want fortune
m_ex_cocoa_03_19,to smile upon everyone.
m_ex_cocoa_03_20,"You should start sending this letter out straight away, Master."
m_ex_cocoa_03_21,I don't know who else I can send it to.
m_ex_cocoa_03_22,You're kidding.
m_ex_cocoa_03_23,You don't have even one other person in mind?
m_ex_cocoa_03_24,Nope. I'm about to get slammed with bad luck.
m_ex_cocoa_03_25,Cocoa doesn't respond for a while.
m_ex_cocoa_03_26,"Master,"
m_ex_cocoa_03_27,come to the Maid Cafe. Quick!
m_ex_cocoa_03_28,??
m_ex_cocoa_03_29,"I asked some of the customers if they'd mind being sent the lucky letter,"
m_ex_cocoa_03_30,and they said they'd be happy to receive it.
m_ex_cocoa_03_31,So you can just send the letter to them.
m_ex_cocoa_03_32,It's not really that impor...
m_ex_cocoa_03_33,"Master,"
m_ex_cocoa_03_34,you could be facing 3 years of bad luck here!
m_ex_cocoa_03_35,"Sorry, but I've got to go. Ade is calling me."
m_ex_cocoa_03_36,Remember to send the letter over Blabla when you arrive at the Maid Cafe!
m_ex_biscuit_01_1,"Hey there, Trainer."
m_ex_biscuit_01_2,"Biscuit, at your service!"
m_ex_biscuit_01_3,I'm responsible for
m_ex_biscuit_01_4,keeping a leash on all those cute puppies
m_ex_biscuit_01_5,in the Happy Zoo Squad.
m_ex_biscuit_01_6,"Why did you call me ""Trainer""?"
m_ex_biscuit_01_7,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_biscuit_01_8,"I was told that once we're all living under the same roof,"
m_ex_biscuit_01_9,you'll be taking care of our little stable of critters.
m_ex_biscuit_01_10,"I'd say that makes ""Trainer"" a fitting moniker for you."
m_ex_biscuit_01_11,I suppose so.
m_ex_biscuit_01_12,Hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_01_13,"Actually, I was a little worried you wouldn't be so keen on me calling you that."
m_ex_biscuit_01_14,"I'm glad that you like it, hee hee!"
m_ex_biscuit_01_15,"Now that introductions are out of the way, we can..."
m_ex_biscuit_01_16,Happily!
m_ex_biscuit_01_17,U・ᴥ・U
m_ex_biscuit_01_18,Joyfully!
m_ex_biscuit_01_19,U^ᴥ^U
m_ex_biscuit_01_20,And woof-woofily!
m_ex_biscuit_01_21,U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_biscuit_01_22,... Spend time with the doggos!
m_ex_biscuit_01_23,... Woof-woofily?
m_ex_biscuit_01_24,Arf arf!
m_ex_biscuit_01_25,Isn't it great? I came up with that term myself.
m_ex_biscuit_01_26,!!
m_ex_biscuit_01_27,That's the spirit!
m_ex_biscuit_01_28,Hee hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_01_29,"I'll see you next time, furry bois in tow."
m_ex_biscuit_01_30,See you around.

m_ex_biscuit_02_6,Biscuit?
m_ex_biscuit_02_7,Whoops!
m_ex_biscuit_02_8,Sorry!
m_ex_biscuit_02_9,The puppies were trampling all over my phone.
m_ex_biscuit_02_10,Cats usually do that more often.
m_ex_biscuit_02_11,Huh?
m_ex_biscuit_02_12,You mean cats are able to use phones now?
m_ex_biscuit_02_13,What clever little kitties!
m_ex_biscuit_02_14,I've gotta ask Nero about this.
m_ex_biscuit_02_15,"Erm, or maybe you shouldn't bother her..."
m_ex_biscuit_02_16,Oh? No?
m_ex_biscuit_02_17,If you say so U @ᴥ@ U
m_ex_biscuit_02_18,How did your phone end up falling victim to a stampede of puppies?
m_ex_biscuit_02_19,Hmm...U ´ᴥ` U
m_ex_biscuit_02_20,The animal shelter wanted me to come in and volunteer today
m_ex_biscuit_02_21,because they're super swamped.

m_ex_biscuit_02_27,Ugh!
m_ex_biscuit_02_28,Sorry about that.
m_ex_biscuit_02_29,They almost took it away again.
m_ex_biscuit_02_30,Those little guys really are obsessed with my phone...
m_ex_biscuit_02_31,U ;;ᴥ;; U
m_ex_biscuit_02_32,"I'm sorry about this, Trainer,"
m_ex_biscuit_02_33,but it may be a good idea to turn off notifications from me for a while.
m_ex_biscuit_02_34,Otherwise I'm afraid I'll keep pestering you with these random messages.

m_ex_biscuit_02_36,"Sure, I'll turn them off."
m_ex_biscuit_02_37,!_!!++}{}±±>§§-13];l[.
m_ex_biscuit_02_38,I think I'll take Biscuit's advice and mute her notifications for a while.
m_ex_biscuit_03_1,Trainer!
m_ex_biscuit_03_2,Which of these barks is your favorite:
m_ex_biscuit_03_3,Arf Arf!
m_ex_biscuit_03_4,Ruff ruff!
m_ex_biscuit_03_5,Woof woof!
m_ex_biscuit_03_6,Which one is your favorite?
m_ex_biscuit_03_7,Um...
m_ex_biscuit_03_8,"Sorry, did you say ""woof, woof""?"
m_ex_biscuit_03_9,Is that one your favorite?
m_ex_biscuit_03_10,What was up with those other choices?
m_ex_biscuit_03_11,The others?
m_ex_biscuit_03_12,"They're just different variations on a barking sound, I suppose."
m_ex_biscuit_03_13,Hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_14,... Alrighty then.
m_ex_biscuit_03_15,I'm gonna need a little more information.
m_ex_biscuit_03_16,Oh...
m_ex_biscuit_03_17,Allow me to explain.
m_ex_biscuit_03_18,Each bark is best suited to a type of puppy U ´ᴥ` U
m_ex_biscuit_03_19,Arf arf! is for real powerhouse puppers U ´ᴥ` U
m_ex_biscuit_03_20,Ruff ruff! is for super peppy puppies U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_biscuit_03_21,Woof woof! is for timid yet delightful doggos U=ᴥ=U
m_ex_biscuit_03_22,"In that case, I prefer ""Arf arf!"""
m_ex_biscuit_03_23,"In that case, I prefer ""Ruff ruff!"""
m_ex_biscuit_03_24,"I'm still going with ""Woof woof!"" as my favorite."
m_ex_biscuit_03_25,That makes more sense that you'd choose that.
m_ex_biscuit_03_26,So you like frolicsome fluffy bois.
m_ex_biscuit_03_27,Ah-hah!
m_ex_biscuit_03_28,I knew you'd be a sucker for those cuddly little livewires!
m_ex_biscuit_03_29,Really?
m_ex_biscuit_03_30,I'm surprised.
m_ex_biscuit_03_31,I thought for sure
m_ex_biscuit_03_32,you'd pick one of the other two choices.
m_ex_biscuit_03_33,I'm also a fan of Grrr.
m_ex_biscuit_03_34,Grrr?
m_ex_biscuit_03_35,What kind of puppy makes that noise?
m_ex_biscuit_03_36,Poli.
m_ex_biscuit_03_37,Oh.
m_ex_biscuit_03_38,... Oh!
m_ex_biscuit_03_39,That's how Poli barks
m_ex_biscuit_03_40,"when she's angry at Miranda, isn't it?"
m_ex_biscuit_03_41,Sure is.
m_ex_biscuit_03_42,"Hee hee, okay! I think I can see the appeal."
m_ex_biscuit_03_43,Poli's pretty adorable as well.
m_ex_biscuit_03_44,"""Hee hee"" does it for me as well."
m_ex_biscuit_03_45,Hee hee?
m_ex_biscuit_03_46,Who says that?
m_ex_biscuit_03_47,Look at the messages you just sent me.
m_ex_biscuit_03_48,Huh? My messages?
m_ex_biscuit_03_49,!!!
m_ex_biscuit_03_50,"Er, oh."
m_ex_biscuit_03_51,Did you figure out who it is?
m_ex_biscuit_03_52,Um...
m_ex_biscuit_03_53,is it me?
m_ex_biscuit_03_54,Bingo.
m_ex_biscuit_03_55,Hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_56,Hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_57,Hee hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_58,Trainer likes me...
m_ex_biscuit_03_59,Agh! This is so embarrassing!
m_ex_biscuit_03_60,And fantastic!
m_ex_biscuit_03_61,I'll have to say that more often then!
m_ex_biscuit_03_62,Hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_63,Hee hee.
m_ex_biscuit_03_64,Hee hee hee!
m_ex_biscuit_03_65,Hee hee hee!
m_ex_biscuit_03_66,Hee hee hee hee hee!
m_ex_maidforyou_01_1,Say...
m_ex_maidforyou_01_2,Has anyone seen Cocorella today?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_3,Cocowhat now?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_4,Have you lost your umbrella?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_5,My black umbrella.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_6,I lost it at some point while I was outside.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_7,I can't find it anywhere.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_8,Yeah.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_9,"When I got back, it was missing, and now I can't find it."
m_ex_maidforyou_01_10,Hmm...
m_ex_maidforyou_01_11,Why don't you retrace your steps?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_12,We'll all put our heads together and see if we can come up with anything.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_13,Let's see...
m_ex_maidforyou_01_14,The first thing I did was go to the toy store to see Mica and Belorta.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_15,Then I went to the comic book store in Talentum Mall.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_16,Then to the Commander's Room to hang out with Master.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_17,"And finally, I did a shift at the Maid Cafe before heading home."
m_ex_maidforyou_01_18,Quite the busy schedule.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_19,Any self-respecting maid never spends her time idly.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_20,What was that about Cocorella?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_21,It's gone missing?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_22,I'm passing by the toy store right now.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_23,I'll pop in and have a look.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_24,I'm here cleaning the Maid Cafe. I'll check around here.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_25,"In that case,"
m_ex_maidforyou_01_26,I'll head over to the Talentum Mall.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_27,Leave the Commander's Room to me.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_28,I rummage through the Commander's Room for a long time.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_29,The staff at the toy store said they haven't seen anything.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_30,It doesn't seem to be in the cafe either.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_31,Maybe someone thought it was theirs and took it by mistake?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_32,?!?!?!?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_33,This can't be happening!
m_ex_maidforyou_01_34,"No sign of it at the comic book shop, either."
m_ex_maidforyou_01_35,I think I found it.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_36,"For reasons that elude me, the umbrella was in the trash can."
m_ex_maidforyou_01_37,Awesome!
m_ex_maidforyou_01_38,I figured Master would be the one to find it.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_39,You're the best Master! I'm not worthy!
m_ex_maidforyou_01_40,"Having said that, now might not be the best time to bring it to you."
m_ex_maidforyou_01_41,Why not?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_42,Cocorella positively reeks at the moment.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_43,Cocorella also needs some time alone.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_44,What happened?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_45,Did Cocorella fart?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_46,What happened?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_47,Did Cocorella... wet the bed?
m_ex_maidforyou_01_48,What the... no.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_49,Then I'm afraid I'll have to insist it is returned at once.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_50,Cocoa.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_51,Have some faith.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_52,I'm sure there's a reason Master doesn't want to return Cocorella yet.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_53,...
m_ex_maidforyou_01_54,Fine.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_55,"I'll wait,"
m_ex_maidforyou_01_56,but only because I'm a professional.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_57,It should only take a day or so.
m_ex_maidforyou_01_58,I will wash the umbrella before returning it to Cocoa.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_1,Yeah!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_2,I'm gonna develop a magical new product
m_ex_maidforyou_02_3,that'll make every master in the world happy.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_4,Ohmygodohmygod!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_5,The time has finally come.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_6,What exactly is this new magical product?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_7,I'm glad you asked.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_8,We're going to be introducing a new set meal that has fondue and black tea.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_9,"However, any customer who orders that has to say a little jingle first."
m_ex_maidforyou_02_10,Like say...
m_ex_maidforyou_02_11,"Drip, drop. Splish, splash. Be delicious and don't be trash!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_12,Something like that.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_13,!!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_14,Heh-heh.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_15,I've got all sorts of great ideas stirring around.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_16,Can I share a few choice ones?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_17,How about we all come up with our own little jingle?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_18,"Okay, mine will be:"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_19,"Squish, squelch, ketchup fondue for me and you!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_20,Why the obsession with ketchup?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_21,I'm just giving them some options.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_22,My turn.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_23,"Bloop bloop, out comes the tea!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_24,"Isn't it cute? Now, repeat after me! Meow meow!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_25,"For the last part, you gotta put your hands on your head like cat ears."
m_ex_maidforyou_02_26,Isn't this embarrassing?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_27,"Sure, that should work."
m_ex_maidforyou_02_28,Eh?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_29,You think so?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_30,Do you really mean that? :(
m_ex_maidforyou_02_31,No... of course not...
m_ex_maidforyou_02_32,Then prove it.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_33,"I can understand you might be a bit shy, but I know just how to overcome that."
m_ex_maidforyou_02_34,You just need to imagine yourself as a maid.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_35,Then you can help us come up with some more slogans.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_36,We've got plenty of our own ideas.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_37,Woohoo!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_38,Master praised me.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_39,Now I can die happy.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_40,Oh no you don't. You don't get to die yet.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_41,"Now that we all shared our slogans,"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_42,"it's your turn, Master."
m_ex_maidforyou_02_43,"I have to come up with one, too?"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_44,"You don't have to,"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_45,"but since we're so ensconced in the maid industry,"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_46,it could be helpful to hear some input from a layman.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_47,Hmm...
m_ex_maidforyou_02_48,I feel it might be best to say whatever first comes to mind.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_49,"No pain, no gain. You gotta grin and bear it, even if it's embarrassing!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_50,"Oooh-rah! Booyah! Gimme the cutest transformation of all, rah rah rah!"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_51,?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_52,?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_53,?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_54,?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_55,That...
m_ex_maidforyou_02_56,was awesome!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_57,"I can see some customers coming,"
m_ex_maidforyou_02_58,so we'll have to save the slogans for another time.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_59,Very well.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_60,A true maid must know when to stop.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_61,I'll go ahead and get back to cleaning!
m_ex_maidforyou_02_62,Talk to you guys later.
m_ex_maidforyou_02_63,Was my slogan really that bad?
m_ex_maidforyou_02_64,... No one answers.
m_ex_soda_01_1,Hello!
m_ex_soda_01_2,"Excuse me, but is this Commander {AccountData.NickName}?"
m_ex_soda_01_3,Yes.
m_ex_soda_01_4,No.
m_ex_soda_01_5,"Phew, good."
m_ex_soda_01_6,0____o
m_ex_soda_01_7,Sorry!
m_ex_soda_01_8,Just kidding :D
m_ex_soda_01_9,"Aw man, you got me good, Master!"
m_ex_soda_01_10,I thought for sure I'd texted the wrong person.
m_ex_soda_01_11,What's up?
m_ex_soda_01_12,"We're going to be working together, and"
m_ex_soda_01_13,I just wanted to introduce myself.
m_ex_soda_01_14,My name's Soda. I'm responsible for all the cooking and cleaning in Maid For You.
m_ex_soda_01_15,Text me whenever you need anything.
m_ex_soda_01_16,"I also give great massages, and I'm able to clean your ears as well if you need that."
m_ex_soda_01_17,"Actually, now that you mention it..."
m_ex_soda_01_18,Yes?
m_ex_soda_01_19,My neck has been killing me lately. I could use a massage.
m_ex_soda_01_20,My ears have been super itchy lately. I could use an ear cleaning.
m_ex_soda_01_21,"Ah, gotcha."
m_ex_soda_01_22,"Well, whenever you're free,"
m_ex_soda_01_23,stop by the Maid Cafe.
m_ex_soda_01_24,I'll have you feeling better in no time.
m_ex_soda_01_25,I can also come to you if that's more convenient.
m_ex_soda_01_26,"Great, thanks."
m_ex_soda_01_27,"Anyway,"
m_ex_soda_01_28,I should get back to cleaning.
m_ex_soda_01_29,See you around!
m_ex_soda_01_30,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_soda_02_1,Master!
m_ex_soda_02_2,Are you in the Commander's Room?
m_ex_soda_02_3,Not at the moment.
m_ex_soda_02_4,When will you be back?
m_ex_soda_02_5,I've got a surprise for you when you get back!
m_ex_soda_02_6,I just arrived...
m_ex_soda_02_7,Tah-dah!
m_ex_soda_02_8,Did you clean my room for me?
m_ex_soda_02_9,Yep!
m_ex_soda_02_10,I did it while you were out.
m_ex_soda_02_11,Thank you.
m_ex_soda_02_12,You entered my room without permission?
m_ex_soda_02_13,!!
m_ex_soda_02_14,"Whoops, sorry!"
m_ex_soda_02_15,"I thought you might be tired after a long day at work, so I tidied up your room for you."
m_ex_soda_02_16,I never thought about having to ask for permission...
m_ex_soda_02_17,I'm just kidding. Thank you.
m_ex_soda_02_18,"Oh, haha! Very funny!"
m_ex_soda_02_19,"What do you think? Super clean, isn't it?"
m_ex_soda_02_20,"Yes, but..."
m_ex_soda_02_21,But?
m_ex_soda_02_22,There's a pair of rubber gloves on the desk.
m_ex_soda_02_23,Huh?
m_ex_soda_02_24,What are those doing there?
m_ex_soda_02_25,You tell me.
m_ex_soda_02_26,I swore I took all my cleaning supplies back with me.
m_ex_soda_02_27,There's a spray bottle on the sofa as well.
m_ex_soda_02_28,Huh?
m_ex_soda_02_29,Hmm...
m_ex_soda_02_30,"Oh, that!"
m_ex_soda_02_31,I was going to come back for that later.
m_ex_soda_02_32,I guess I ended up forgetting about it.
m_ex_soda_02_33,"The cap is loose, and there's liquid seeping out."
m_ex_soda_02_34,That doesn't sound good...
m_ex_soda_02_35,The sofa is soaked.
m_ex_soda_02_36,Oh no!
m_ex_soda_02_37,I'm sorry.
m_ex_soda_02_38,I'll clean it right away!
m_ex_soda_03_1,Master!
m_ex_soda_03_2,Maaaaaster!
m_ex_soda_03_3,Yes?
m_ex_soda_03_4,I wanted to get Cocoa a gift.
m_ex_soda_03_5,Do you have any suggestions?
m_ex_soda_03_6,Is it her birthday?
m_ex_soda_03_7,Why do you want to get her a gift out of the blue?
m_ex_soda_03_8,"No, it's not her birthday."
m_ex_soda_03_9,"She's been working so hard recently,"
m_ex_soda_03_10,so Ade and I wanted to surprise her with a gift.
m_ex_soda_03_11,"Ade wants me to come up with a few ideas,"
m_ex_soda_03_12,but I'm totally stumped.
m_ex_soda_03_13,I want to get Cocoa something that can come in handy.
m_ex_soda_03_14,How about some colored paper?
m_ex_soda_03_15,How about some sweet-and-sour ketchup?
m_ex_soda_03_16,"I bought her some of that yesterday, hehe."
m_ex_soda_03_17,"How about ketchup, then?"
m_ex_soda_03_18,Ketchup?
m_ex_soda_03_19,That's right! She was interested in this new brand of ketchup that just came out.
m_ex_soda_03_20,That'd make for a great gift.
m_ex_soda_03_21,She can use it to draw patterns on top of her omurice.
m_ex_soda_03_22,Are you sure that's enough to be considered a gift?
m_ex_soda_03_23,Absolutely! It's one of Cocoa's favorite things.
m_ex_soda_03_24,I can almost hear her now:
m_ex_soda_03_25,Thank you so much! Ketchup is my absolute favorite!
m_ex_soda_03_26,"Here, let me make you both some omurice."
m_ex_soda_03_27,Hahahaha
m_ex_soda_03_28,I'm gonna go buy some of that ketchup.
m_ex_soda_03_29,"Thanks for the idea, Master!"
m_ex_sakura_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_sakura_01_2,"I'm Sakura, the head of Seimeikai."
m_ex_sakura_01_3,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_sakura_01_4,"Nice to meet you, too."
m_ex_sakura_01_5,All right then.
m_ex_sakura_01_6,There's no further reply from Sakura. She seems to be considering what to say next.
m_ex_sakura_01_7,There's something I wanted to ask you.
m_ex_sakura_01_8,What is it?
m_ex_sakura_01_9,What are some things you like?
m_ex_sakura_01_10,I feel this is something I should know about.
m_ex_sakura_01_11,I like you.
m_ex_sakura_01_12,... {AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_01_13,Do you really think it's appropriate to be making such childish jokes
m_ex_sakura_01_14,when we've only just met?
m_ex_sakura_01_15,Sorry...
m_ex_sakura_01_16,Let's try this again.
m_ex_sakura_01_17,What are some things you like?
m_ex_sakura_01_18,I like drinking tea.
m_ex_sakura_01_19,I like gazing at flowers.
m_ex_sakura_01_20,You do?
m_ex_sakura_01_21,What kind of tea do you prefer?
m_ex_sakura_01_22,I enjoy pretty much all kinds of tea.
m_ex_sakura_01_23,"In that case, how about I invite you over for tea sometime?"
m_ex_sakura_01_24,That sounds nice.
m_ex_sakura_01_25,Is that so?
m_ex_sakura_01_26,One of my favorite activities is going for a stroll and taking in the flora.
m_ex_sakura_01_27,Sounds like we have the same hobby.
m_ex_sakura_01_28,"If you'd like to,"
m_ex_sakura_01_29,"the next time we talk online, we could each have a cup of tea and share our thoughts."
m_ex_sakura_01_30,That'd be nice.
m_ex_sakura_01_31,How fantastic that we share the same hobby.
m_ex_sakura_01_32,"As long as you're free,"
m_ex_sakura_01_33,I'd like to invite you over to my residence.
m_ex_sakura_01_34,"For now though, I must go."
m_ex_sakura_01_35,Have a nice day.
m_ex_sakura_02_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_sakura_02_2,are you busy?
m_ex_sakura_02_3,I'm wondering what I should prepare for the afternoon tea.
m_ex_sakura_02_4,What would you prefer?
m_ex_sakura_02_5,You mean what kind of food I'd like?
m_ex_sakura_02_6,Precisely.
m_ex_sakura_02_7,Cookies would be nice.
m_ex_sakura_02_8,Some cake would be nice.
m_ex_sakura_02_9,So you're a fan of cookies?
m_ex_sakura_02_10,I'll prepare some that will go well with the tea.
m_ex_sakura_02_11,So you have a soft spot for cakes?
m_ex_sakura_02_12,I'll prepare something I'm sure you'll enjoy
m_ex_sakura_02_13,"Wait, are you getting all this ready for me?"
m_ex_sakura_02_14,Of course.
m_ex_sakura_02_15,Who else?
m_ex_sakura_02_16,Why?
m_ex_sakura_02_17,Huh?
m_ex_sakura_02_18,Aren't you coming over today?
m_ex_sakura_02_19,I heard that you were.
m_ex_sakura_02_20,I intentionally kept my schedule open today
m_ex_sakura_02_21,so that I could be here to greet you.
m_ex_sakura_02_22,"I don't know what you heard, but I wasn't intending on coming over today."
m_ex_sakura_02_23,Sakura doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_sakura_02_24,Sorry for the late reply. I was just confirming something.
m_ex_sakura_02_25,Turns out one of my subordinates made a mistake.
m_ex_sakura_02_26,"I do have a guest coming today, but it's someone else, not you."
m_ex_sakura_02_27,I apologize on behalf of my subordinates for their error.
m_ex_sakura_02_28,No worries. It's not a big deal.
m_ex_sakura_02_29,At least I have a better idea of what you enjoy eating.
m_ex_sakura_02_30,"The next time you come visit me,"
m_ex_sakura_02_31,I'll prepare some refreshments that are perfectly suited to your tastes.
m_ex_sakura_02_32,Thank you.
m_ex_sakura_02_33,You're welcome.
m_ex_sakura_02_34,Have a nice day.
m_ex_sakura_03_1,I was reading about hot springs that were on the surface in ancient times.
m_ex_sakura_03_2,"Tell me,"
m_ex_sakura_03_3,do you like hot springs?
m_ex_sakura_03_4,Very much. Nothing beats a warm dip in a hot spring.
m_ex_sakura_03_5,"I do, but they're gone now, so I can't enjoy them."
m_ex_sakura_03_6,I feel the same way.
m_ex_sakura_03_7,Soaking in a warm hot spring
m_ex_sakura_03_8,makes all my fatigue just melt away.
m_ex_sakura_03_9,Tell me about it.
m_ex_sakura_03_10,"There aren't any hot springs in the Ark, either."
m_ex_sakura_03_11,What made you bring up hot springs all of a sudden?
m_ex_sakura_03_12,"I just told you! I was reading about them in a book, and it caught my interest."
m_ex_sakura_03_13,"So, I decided to divert some natural hot spring water to make my own hot spring."
m_ex_sakura_03_14,Is that actually possible?
m_ex_sakura_03_15,It sure is.
m_ex_sakura_03_16,I asked my subordinates to look into whether it was feasible to make a hot spring in the courtyard.
m_ex_sakura_03_17,"Turns out it is, so they went ahead and made one."
m_ex_sakura_03_18,The only thing is that the courtyard looks a bit bare with just the hot spring and nothing else.
m_ex_sakura_03_19,"If you're up for it, we could..."
m_ex_sakura_03_20,Let's do it.
m_ex_sakura_03_21,Right now?
m_ex_sakura_03_22,Whoa...
m_ex_sakura_03_23,All right.
m_ex_sakura_03_24,"Sorry, it's just that I didn't expect you to agree so readily to it."
m_ex_sakura_03_25,I'm glad you're so enthusiastic about helping me think about
m_ex_sakura_03_26,what trees and flowers I should plant by the hot spring.
m_ex_sakura_03_27,"Oh, I thought you meant..."
m_ex_sakura_03_28,Something the matter?
m_ex_sakura_03_29,Oh... er... nothing.
m_ex_sakura_03_30,"Anyway, whenever you're free,"
m_ex_sakura_03_31,come stop by.
m_ex_sakura_03_32,I'll be expecting you.
m_ex_sakura_03_33,Got it.
m_ex_d_01_1,Testing. Testing.
m_ex_d_01_2,??
m_ex_d_01_3,"Wow, text messages are great! So easy."
m_ex_d_01_4,1234567890
m_ex_d_01_5,!@#%^&*()
m_ex_d_01_6,"Letters, numbers, special characters."
m_ex_d_01_7,Test completed.
m_ex_d_01_8,What are you doing?
m_ex_d_01_9,I'm testing my device.
m_ex_d_01_10,All done.
m_ex_d_01_11,Okay...
m_ex_d_01_12,But why?
m_ex_d_01_13,Hm...
m_ex_d_01_14,"I was told to contact you,"
m_ex_d_01_15,and was given a cellphone.
m_ex_d_01_16,"Now that the test is complete, I can properly introduce myself."
m_ex_d_01_17,I'm D.
m_ex_d_01_18,Is that your real name?
m_ex_d_01_19,"No, it's a code name."
m_ex_d_01_20,I'm from the Perilous Siege squad.
m_ex_d_01_21,"Per orders from the Judges and the Central Government,"
m_ex_d_01_22,"I am to serve under your command, effective immediately."
m_ex_d_01_23,Let me know if you need anything.
m_ex_d_01_24,"If I'm not on an assignment, I'll offer assistance."
m_ex_d_01_25,"What exactly are these ""assignments"" you're referring to?"
m_ex_d_01_26,Tracking down and eliminating whoever
m_ex_d_01_27,"breaks the law, commits acts of transgression,"
m_ex_d_01_28,or otherwise poses a threat to the Ark.
m_ex_d_01_29,"My targets encompass a wide range of individuals,"
m_ex_d_01_30,and occasionally even include high-ranking officials in the Ark and the Outer Rim.
m_ex_d_01_31,"Once they are targeted for termination, their fate is sealed."
m_ex_d_01_32,That is my mission.
m_ex_d_01_33,"Naturally,"
m_ex_d_01_34,you could also become a potential target.
m_ex_d_01_35,Bear that in mind.
m_ex_d_01_36,You're a person of some renown in the Ark.
m_ex_d_01_37,You've got a lot of eyes on you.
m_ex_d_01_38,"The more Nikkes you have under your command,"
m_ex_d_01_39,the more people will see you as a threat.
m_ex_d_01_40,You'll have no shortage of enemies.
m_ex_d_01_41,Be acutely aware of your words and actions.
m_ex_d_01_42,I wouldn't want to see your name appear
m_ex_d_01_43,on one of my mission briefings.
m_ex_d_01_44,I'll keep that in mind.
m_ex_d_01_45,That's all I have to say.
m_ex_d_01_46,Is there anything else you want to know?
m_ex_d_01_47,"Even if I did, I don't think you'd answer."
m_ex_d_01_48,Not at the moment.
m_ex_d_01_49,A wise choice.
m_ex_d_01_50,"So long as you don't become a target,"
m_ex_d_01_51,I won't lay a finger on you.
m_ex_d_01_52,That I can promise you.
m_ex_d_01_53,How reassuring.
m_ex_d_01_54,"Okay,"
m_ex_d_01_55,catch you later.
m_ex_d_02_1,I have a question.
m_ex_d_02_2,What is it?
m_ex_d_02_3,"Sometimes, when I'm passing through an alley,"
m_ex_d_02_4,I can sense that people are afraid of me.
m_ex_d_02_5,Do you have any idea why that is?
m_ex_d_02_6,I might have a slight idea why...
m_ex_d_02_7,Maybe you were just imagining things.
m_ex_d_02_8,Why?
m_ex_d_02_9,"No, this was no figment of my imagination."
m_ex_d_02_10,"The moment I made eye contact with them,"
m_ex_d_02_11,they'd yelp and avert their gaze.
m_ex_d_02_12,Were you holding your axe?
m_ex_d_02_13,Huh?
m_ex_d_02_14,Of course I was.
m_ex_d_02_15,Do you see how that could perhaps be an issue?
m_ex_d_02_16,Why would it be?
m_ex_d_02_17,I wasn't chasing anyone or even brandishing it.
m_ex_d_02_18,You know that I don't kill innocent people.
m_ex_d_02_19,"Be that as it may, a weapon is a weapon."
m_ex_d_02_20,D doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_d_02_21,So what should I do?
m_ex_d_02_22,Don't walk around brandishing your axe when you're not on an assignment.
m_ex_d_02_23,"When you're out and about, always be smiling."
m_ex_d_02_24,No can do.
m_ex_d_02_25,I never know when I'll be given an assignment.
m_ex_d_02_26,"Okay then. When you're out and about, always be smiling."
m_ex_d_02_27,Are you trying to be funny? Why would I do that?
m_ex_d_02_28,Smiling is the best way to leave a good impression.
m_ex_d_02_29,Hmm.
m_ex_d_02_30,Is it?
m_ex_d_02_31,Got it.
m_ex_d_02_32,I'll try it out right away.
m_ex_d_02_33,It's raining outside.
m_ex_d_02_34,How about waiting until it's sunny out?
m_ex_d_02_35,D doesn't reply. She must have gone out.
m_ex_d_02_36,I did what you said.
m_ex_d_02_37,Everyone ran away in a panic.
m_ex_d_02_38,So much for your bright idea.
m_ex_d_02_39,... Sorry.
m_ex_d_02_40,You have nothing to apologize for.
m_ex_d_02_41,We'll just have to come up with another solution.
m_ex_d_02_42,we should figure another way out.
m_ex_d_02_43,I'll let you know if I come up with anything.
m_ex_d_02_44,Me too.
m_ex_d_03_1,Do you like performing?
m_ex_d_03_2,Some of my assignments require me to do a little acting.
m_ex_d_03_3,"I have a hard time finding someone to practice my acting with, though."
m_ex_d_03_4,K isn't exactly a great thespian.
m_ex_d_03_5,"If I hadn't been a commander, I'd have been an actor."
m_ex_d_03_6,"Unfortunately, I'm not a trained actor either."
m_ex_d_03_7,You don't say.
m_ex_d_03_8,Maybe you can tag along
m_ex_d_03_9,on my next mission.
m_ex_d_03_10,Hm...
m_ex_d_03_11,Have you ever considered learning?
m_ex_d_03_12,Let me tell you something.
m_ex_d_03_13,Knowing how to perform can be a lifesaver
m_ex_d_03_14,when you're on certain missions.
m_ex_d_03_15,What role are you best at playing?
m_ex_d_03_16,I'm good at playing almost anything.
m_ex_d_03_17,"A girl immersed in unrequited love, a wealthy mademoiselle, a tramp..."
m_ex_d_03_18,Sometimes I can even imitate animals.
m_ex_d_03_19,Animals? How on earth do you pull that off?
m_ex_d_03_20,I don't actually pretend to be an animal.
m_ex_d_03_21,I hide in the bushes and imitate the sounds they make.
m_ex_d_03_22,"Sometimes, a target will respond to these sounds."
m_ex_d_03_23,"Next time I'm free, I'd love to see a demonstration."
m_ex_d_03_24,Sure thing.
m_ex_d_03_25,"Anyway, what role would you be interested in playing?"
m_ex_d_03_26,An assassin.
m_ex_d_03_27,A boyfriend.
m_ex_d_03_28,That should be easy enough.
m_ex_d_03_29,What would I need to do?
m_ex_d_03_30,Nothing special.
m_ex_d_03_31,"Whenever you've got a target who's behaving immorally,"
m_ex_d_03_32,you take your axe and chop'em to bits straight away.
m_ex_d_03_33,... That seems a bit outside the realm of acting.
m_ex_d_03_34,You're the one who wanted to be an assassin!
m_ex_d_03_35,"In that case,"
m_ex_d_03_36,I can play the girlfriend.
m_ex_d_03_37,How about we run through a scene now?
m_ex_d_03_38,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_d_03_39,Ready... action!
m_ex_d_03_40,Darling!
m_ex_d_03_41,"Yes, my dear?"
m_ex_d_03_42,When are you going to marry me?
m_ex_d_03_43,I'm not getting any younger.
m_ex_d_03_44,"My family pesters me day and night, demanding to know when I'll be wed."
m_ex_d_03_45,"You told me to wait, and I have."
m_ex_d_03_46,How long do you intend to keep me waiting?
m_ex_d_03_47,Are you going to marry me or not?
m_ex_d_03_48,"Whenever I broach the issue of marriage,"
m_ex_d_03_49,you always change the subject.
m_ex_d_03_50,Almost all my female friends
m_ex_d_03_51,have been proposed.
m_ex_d_03_52,"You don't intend on breaking up with me, do you?"
m_ex_d_03_53,Are you seeing another woman?
m_ex_d_03_54,If you are...
m_ex_d_03_55,... Just a minute. Can we start again?
m_ex_d_03_56,What's the matter? That was good.
m_ex_d_03_57,It was just... a lot to take in at a go.
m_ex_d_03_58,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_d_03_59,Come by the hotel whenever you're free.
m_ex_d_03_60,Okay.
m_ex_rei_01_1,Teacher.
m_ex_rei_01_2,I heard you're going to be coming to our school.
m_ex_rei_01_3,??
m_ex_rei_01_4,"At least,"
m_ex_rei_01_5,that's what I've heard.
m_ex_rei_01_6,There's supposed to be a famous Commander coming to work as a substitute teacher at our school.
m_ex_rei_01_7,How did you know?
m_ex_rei_01_8,"I have my sources, hee-hee."
m_ex_rei_01_9,"I'm not a first year student here, y'know."
m_ex_rei_01_10,It's not even my second year.
m_ex_rei_01_11,It's my third year here!
m_ex_rei_01_12,One.
m_ex_rei_01_13,Two.
m_ex_rei_01_14,THREE!
m_ex_rei_01_15,3 >>>>>>>>>>> 2>> 1
m_ex_rei_01_16,Three is waaaaaay bigger than one or two.
m_ex_rei_01_17,"It's on a totally different level,"
m_ex_rei_01_18,and that's the highest in the school.
m_ex_rei_01_19,"So basically, what I'm saying is,"
m_ex_rei_01_20,I've got plenty of access to information.
m_ex_rei_01_21,... I think she needs to get taken down a peg.
m_ex_rei_01_22,My assignment as a substitute is supposed to be top secret.
m_ex_rei_01_23,??
m_ex_rei_01_24,It is?
m_ex_rei_01_25,"Absolutely. Extremely classified, as per the Central Government."
m_ex_rei_01_26,Wowee!
m_ex_rei_01_27,So I want to know how you came across this information.
m_ex_rei_01_28,"Uh, well..."
m_ex_rei_01_29,"You do realize that stealing classified information is a crime, don't you?"
m_ex_rei_01_30,No!
m_ex_rei_01_31,Er...
m_ex_rei_01_32,I mean...
m_ex_rei_01_33,What I meant was... I just imagined it.
m_ex_rei_01_34,"Yeah, that's it."
m_ex_rei_01_35,I was just thinking about how cool it'd be if a super-famous Commander
m_ex_rei_01_36,came and taught at our school for a bit.
m_ex_rei_01_37,"It was all in my head, hehe."
m_ex_rei_01_38,So you imagined all of it?
m_ex_rei_01_39,"Yep, every last bit."
m_ex_rei_01_40,But... are you actually gonna be a substitute here?
m_ex_rei_01_41,"If you are, then I'm super stoked!"
m_ex_rei_01_42,"I'm already in my third year here,"
m_ex_rei_01_43,I've gotta start conducting myself like a senior student.
m_ex_rei_01_44,I look forward to seeing you improve.
m_ex_rei_01_45,I will.
m_ex_rei_01_46,It's taken me ages to get where I am.
m_ex_rei_01_47,There's so much that I wanna do.
m_ex_rei_01_48,"Like my homework for example, which I need to get started on."
m_ex_rei_01_49,"See you later, Teacher."
m_ex_rei_01_50,Something tells me this assignment won't be a walk in the park...
m_ex_rei_02_1,"Ugh, I don't wanna do my homework."
m_ex_rei_02_2,Can you do it for me?
m_ex_rei_02_3,Do you have a lot of homework?
m_ex_rei_02_4,Oodles and boodles!
m_ex_rei_02_5,"Way too much, if you ask me."
m_ex_rei_02_6,What have you been studying lately?
m_ex_rei_02_7,Hmm...
m_ex_rei_02_8,"Nothing special, really."
m_ex_rei_02_9,Just ordinary coursework.
m_ex_rei_02_10,"Actually, I've been meaning to ask you something."
m_ex_rei_02_11,What is it?
m_ex_rei_02_12,"What does the M.M.R. Vocational School do, exactly?"
m_ex_rei_02_13,"Well, in a nutshell,"
m_ex_rei_02_14,it's...
m_ex_rei_02_15,meant to educate Nikkes.
m_ex_rei_02_16,That sorta thing.
m_ex_rei_02_17,Then what's up with the name?
m_ex_rei_02_18,Beats me.
m_ex_rei_02_19,Maybe M.M.R. is one of the main donors of the school.
m_ex_rei_02_20,Shouldn't you know this kind of stuff by now?
m_ex_rei_02_21,Rei doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_rei_02_22,"For most Nikkes, the limits of their performances are capped at the time of their production."
m_ex_rei_02_23,"Others, however, are capable of improving these thresholds through further education."
m_ex_rei_02_24,"To learn more about this special subsect of Nikkes,"
m_ex_rei_02_25,a special school was established.
m_ex_rei_02_26,M.M.R is responsible for providing education and technical support to its students.
m_ex_rei_02_27,Therefore leading to its designation as a vocational school.
m_ex_rei_02_28,"I've gotta ask Rei, why are you so curious about this all of a sudden?"
m_ex_rei_02_29,... Did you just copy and paste messages Zwei sent you?
m_ex_rei_02_30,I didn't!
m_ex_rei_02_31,None of what you just said sounds like you at all.
m_ex_rei_02_32,There's something off about that last message you just sent.
m_ex_rei_02_33,"I've already told you, I'm a third year student!"
m_ex_rei_02_34,I can speak eloquently when I put my mind to it.
m_ex_rei_02_35,... If you say so.
m_ex_rei_02_36,I do say so.
m_ex_rei_02_37,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_rei_02_38,That... must have been that darned autocorrect.
m_ex_rei_02_39,"It should say ""Teacher"","
m_ex_rei_02_40,"not ""Rei""."
m_ex_rei_02_41,I'm not quite convinced you can blame autocorrect for that...
m_ex_rei_02_42,"I'm telling you, that's what happened!"
m_ex_rei_02_43,"Anyways, does that answer your question?"
m_ex_rei_02_44,"If there's nothing else, I'd like to get started on my homework."
m_ex_rei_02_45,"Oh, right."
m_ex_rei_02_46,I nearly forgot.
m_ex_rei_02_47,Do you want to do my homework for me?
m_ex_rei_02_48,"No, I don't."
m_ex_rei_02_49,Fine...
m_ex_rei_03_1,Teacher.
m_ex_rei_03_2,Ask me anything.
m_ex_rei_03_3,Just be sure to add a question mark at the end.
m_ex_rei_03_4,When are you going to grow taller?
m_ex_rei_03_5,How is life as a third-year student?
m_ex_rei_03_6,(My height.)
m_ex_rei_03_7,(Despite my belief that)
m_ex_rei_03_8,"(I have been growing steadily at an incremental rate,)"
m_ex_rei_03_9,(my actual height has not changed one iota in the past six months.)
m_ex_rei_03_10,(Satisfactory.)
m_ex_rei_03_11,"(Many things have changed, despite moving up only one grade.)"
m_ex_rei_03_12,"(There is a feeling that all of my blood, sweat and tears during my first two years has paid off.)"
m_ex_rei_03_13,"(Having said that, I did not actually experience any truly traumatic events in that time period.)"
m_ex_rei_03_14,(I was merely using a figure of speech.)
m_ex_rei_03_15,... What is going on?
m_ex_rei_03_16,Hee-hee.
m_ex_rei_03_17,"It's an AI I made with Naru 1, 2, and 3."
m_ex_rei_03_18,It can answer questions automatically.
m_ex_rei_03_19,"So long as there is a question mark at the end of a sentence, it will be recognized as a question."
m_ex_rei_03_20,Its answers are a bit... unorthodox.
m_ex_rei_03_21,True...
m_ex_rei_03_22,There are still some kinks I need to work out.
m_ex_rei_03_23,It should be fine after I do some tinkering around.
m_ex_rei_03_24,"A few kinks, huh?"
m_ex_rei_03_25,Yeah.
m_ex_rei_03_26,Do you remember what you learned in class today?
m_ex_rei_03_27,(I slept for approximately 4 hours during today's lesson.)
m_ex_rei_03_28,(I am unable to recall what I learned.)
m_ex_rei_03_29,"Shut up, will you?!"
m_ex_rei_03_30,...
m_ex_rei_03_31,Perhaps I should implement a feature
m_ex_rei_03_32,that allows it to lie.
m_ex_rei_03_33,"Erm, I mean..."
m_ex_rei_03_34,I should allow it to only answer certain questions and not others.
m_ex_rei_03_35,Have you finished all your homework?
m_ex_rei_03_36,"For the love of God, please stop asking questions!"
m_ex_rei_03_37,"(Although I know of this thing called 'homework',)"
m_ex_rei_03_38,"(I have not dedicated much time to completing it. No time at all, in fact.)"
m_ex_rei_03_39,"(When I go to school tomorrow, I will suck up to the teachers.)"
m_ex_rei_03_40,(This is an approximation of the user's thought process.)
m_ex_rei_03_41,...
m_ex_rei_03_42,...
m_ex_rei_03_43,I'm thinking I should pull the plug on this whole AI idea.
m_ex_rei_03_44,That's probably a good idea.
m_ex_rei_03_45,...
m_ex_dorothy_01_1,This is Dorothy from Eden.
m_ex_dorothy_01_2,Are these messages coming through?
m_ex_dorothy_01_3,Loud and clear.
m_ex_dorothy_01_4,Good.
m_ex_dorothy_01_5,"Starting today, I am to provide you with assistance, Your Grace."
m_ex_dorothy_01_6,"What, may I ask, is the reason for this kind offer?"
m_ex_dorothy_01_7,There is no special reason.
m_ex_dorothy_01_8,"It is merely something I have decided to do, nothing more."
m_ex_dorothy_01_9,Although I realize you and I
m_ex_dorothy_01_10,"will not be able to understand each other fully,"
m_ex_dorothy_01_11,there is much overlap in our ideology.
m_ex_dorothy_01_12,It is for that reason that I've decided to assist you.
m_ex_dorothy_01_13,"Well, thanks, I guess."
m_ex_dorothy_01_14,You mustn't thank me so soon.
m_ex_dorothy_01_15,It is far too early for that.
m_ex_dorothy_01_16,We have only just begun.
m_ex_dorothy_01_17,I should also mention that I expect certain things of you as well.
m_ex_dorothy_01_18,Why is that?
m_ex_dorothy_01_19,"It takes a remarkable individual to garner such a reputation in the Ark,"
m_ex_dorothy_01_20,and still manage to find their way to Eden in one piece.
m_ex_dorothy_01_21,It's not often that I take such an interest in other people.
m_ex_dorothy_01_22,I hope that interest is not misplaced.
m_ex_dorothy_01_23,I'll try and make it worth your while.
m_ex_dorothy_01_24,You won't be disappointed.
m_ex_dorothy_01_25,Very well.
m_ex_dorothy_01_26,"It's nice to see you're willing to give it your best shot,"
m_ex_dorothy_01_27,but results are the only thing that matters.
m_ex_dorothy_01_28,I hope you can have some more confidence in your abilities going forward.
m_ex_dorothy_01_29,I'm relieved to see that you're confident.
m_ex_dorothy_01_30,"For now at least, it appears I have chosen wisely."
m_ex_dorothy_01_31,I'm looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_dorothy_01_32,Likewise.
m_ex_dorothy_01_33,I'll be in touch
m_ex_dorothy_01_34,when one of us requires assistance from the other.
m_ex_dorothy_01_35,Have a nice day.
m_ex_dorothy_02_1,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_2,have you seen Isabel recently?
m_ex_dorothy_02_3,"Yes, I have."
m_ex_dorothy_02_4,"No, I haven't"
m_ex_dorothy_02_5,Are you sure
m_ex_dorothy_02_6,you are telling me the truth?
m_ex_dorothy_02_7,... I've seen her.
m_ex_dorothy_02_8,Did anything unusual happen
m_ex_dorothy_02_9,when you last saw her?
m_ex_dorothy_02_10,"No, I guess not."
m_ex_dorothy_02_11,You guess?
m_ex_dorothy_02_12,That's rather vague.
m_ex_dorothy_02_13,I didn't feel like anything out of the ordinary happened.
m_ex_dorothy_02_14,That's good to hear.
m_ex_dorothy_02_15,Isabel has been acting rather erratic recently.
m_ex_dorothy_02_16,"Be forewarned,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_17,"once she fixates on someone, she can potentially become a danger to herself and others."
m_ex_dorothy_02_18,"She's a bit headstrong, and can go a bit overboard at times."
m_ex_dorothy_02_19,So long as she doesn't take it too far.
m_ex_dorothy_02_20,"At any rate, it's clear that her most recent fixation is you."
m_ex_dorothy_02_21,"Be that as it may,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_22,do not let her steamroll over you.
m_ex_dorothy_02_23,You humoring her may cause her to act like a spoiled child.
m_ex_dorothy_02_24,Understood.
m_ex_dorothy_02_25,There's no need to be overly concerned.
m_ex_dorothy_02_26,I'm confident that
m_ex_dorothy_02_27,you won't let anything unfortunate happen.
m_ex_dorothy_02_28,Is there anything else noteworthy?
m_ex_dorothy_02_29,Noah is always harassing me.
m_ex_dorothy_02_30,Harran is always harassing me.
m_ex_dorothy_02_31,"Yes, Noah..."
m_ex_dorothy_02_32,I'm afraid I cannot help you there.
m_ex_dorothy_02_33,Does she tease you relentlessly as well?
m_ex_dorothy_02_34,"Oddly enough, no."
m_ex_dorothy_02_35,"On the contrary,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_36,she is nothing but well-behaved around me.
m_ex_dorothy_02_37,"She and I get along quite well,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_38,so I find her rather endearing.
m_ex_dorothy_02_39,I'm sorry to see that you have not had the same experience with her.
m_ex_dorothy_02_40,Harran...
m_ex_dorothy_02_41,Hmm...
m_ex_dorothy_02_42,She doesn't tend to bully others for no reason.
m_ex_dorothy_02_43,Perhaps you've done something that rubbed her the wrong way.
m_ex_dorothy_02_44,Or maybe she merely gets a kick out of getting your goat.
m_ex_dorothy_02_45,Did I do something wrong?
m_ex_dorothy_02_46,No.
m_ex_dorothy_02_47,I don't think so.
m_ex_dorothy_02_48,"If that was the case, you'd already be dead."
m_ex_dorothy_02_49,Harran wouldn't waste her time on someone she didn't find intriguing.
m_ex_dorothy_02_50,"In fact, I think she may be interested in you."
m_ex_dorothy_02_51,...
m_ex_dorothy_02_52,"From the looks of it,"
m_ex_dorothy_02_53,you're receiving no small amount of attention
m_ex_dorothy_02_54,from our squad.
m_ex_dorothy_02_55,"If there's nothing else, you should go get some rest."
m_ex_dorothy_02_56,See you around.
m_ex_dorothy_03_1,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_03_2,did you send me something?
m_ex_dorothy_03_3,I did. Glad to see it got there okay.
m_ex_dorothy_03_4,"Ah,"
m_ex_dorothy_03_5,so it was from you.
m_ex_dorothy_03_6,I was shocked to see a box with my name written on it.
m_ex_dorothy_03_7,May I open it?
m_ex_dorothy_03_8,Go ahead.
m_ex_dorothy_03_9,Just a moment.
m_ex_dorothy_03_10,After a while.
m_ex_dorothy_03_11,I opened it. It's a parasol.
m_ex_dorothy_03_12,With white lace trimming. Beautiful.
m_ex_dorothy_03_13,What possessed you to send this to me?
m_ex_dorothy_03_14,Don't you like it?
m_ex_dorothy_03_15,I like it very much.
m_ex_dorothy_03_16,"It's just a bit sudden, that's all."
m_ex_dorothy_03_17,"If you intend for this to be a bribe, it's a bit meager."
m_ex_dorothy_03_18,"If you want to grease some palms, a parasol won't get you very far."
m_ex_dorothy_03_19,"On the other hand, if it's just a gift, plain and simple, then what's the reason for sending it?"
m_ex_dorothy_03_20,"It's just an ordinary gift. No more, no less."
m_ex_dorothy_03_21,A gift?
m_ex_dorothy_03_22,Why would you send me a gift out of the blue like this?
m_ex_dorothy_03_23,I'm starting to think you're up to something.
m_ex_dorothy_03_24,Are you trying to get something from me?
m_ex_dorothy_03_25,Is this some elaborate trick to make me appear foolish?
m_ex_dorothy_03_26,I just thought you'd appreciate it.
m_ex_dorothy_03_27,??
m_ex_dorothy_03_28,There is no reply for a while.
m_ex_dorothy_03_29,Let me get this straight.
m_ex_dorothy_03_30,"You thought this parasol suited me,"
m_ex_dorothy_03_31,so you decided to give to me as a gift.
m_ex_dorothy_03_32,"That's it, and that's all."
m_ex_dorothy_03_33,Exactly.
m_ex_dorothy_03_34,And you don't want anything
m_ex_dorothy_03_35,in return?
m_ex_dorothy_03_36,Not at all.
m_ex_dorothy_03_37,Hmm...
m_ex_dorothy_03_38,...
m_ex_dorothy_03_39,In that case...
m_ex_dorothy_03_40,I'll accept it gladly.
m_ex_dorothy_03_41,"For a while afterwards, there are no further messages from Dorothy."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_1,Rouge has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_2,???
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_3,"Hello, Highroller."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_4,"Forgive me for inviting you so suddenly,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_5,"but I feel I was a bit aloof previously, so I wanted to talk with you."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_6,"As you know, luck has been in your favor,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_7,so you will get what your heart desires.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_8,Thank you.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_9,I wasn't fishing for a compliment.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_10,And
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_11,one more thing...
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_12,Blanc has joined the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_13,Noir has joined the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_14,?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_15,What's going on?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_16,Huh?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_17,What do you mean what's going on?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_18,Pit Boss?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_19,How did you two get in here?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_20,"I noticed you've been staring at your phone for a while now,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_21,so I snuck a peek at the group name and joined.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_22,Good grief...
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_23,I thought I had this group set on private.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_24,Guess not! The name popped up as soon as I searched it.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_25,Wait a moment.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_26,Rouge has changed the group settings.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_27,There.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_28,What were you and Pit Boss talking about?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_29,"Yeah, why did you create a private group chat?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_30,Nothing special.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_31,Isn't that right?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_32,"Yep, nothing unusual over here."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_33,"Nothing special? I thought we had something, Rouge."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_34,What?!
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_35,What are you talking about?
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_36,Hehehe.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_37,... Please don't joke around like that.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_38,"Well, at any rate,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_39,it seems like you two were having a good time.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_40,"Now that Noir and I have joined, don't forget about us the next time you're off having fun."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_41,"Yeah, it'll be way more fun with us around!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_42,I was just giving my thoughts on the upcoming event.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_43,"Well, not my personal thoughts necessarily, more like notices and stuff like that."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_44,"Ah, so this is just a temporary group?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_45,"I was wondering why it was called ""Bunny Room"", what a strange name!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_46,Heh-heh.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_47,"Well, the casino is about to open."
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_48,Let's get ready.
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_49,Okie-dokie!
m_ex_bunnyx777_01_50,Okay...
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_1,Commander!
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_2,How'd it go?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_3,How'd what go?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_4,The lottery!
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_5,Didn't you say you had good luck?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_6,"You bought a lottery ticket, didn't you?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_7,Did you win the first prize?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_8,Can we finally afford a fridge for my sodas?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_9,I thought that's what the fridge in the Commander's Room was for.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_10,Huh?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_11,It is?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_12,"I guess you're right, my soda does take up about 90% of that fridge..."
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_13,But that's not important!
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_14,Don't change the subject.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_15,I wanna know if you've won the lottery.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_16,Did you hit the jackpot?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_17,I never bought a ticket.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_18,??
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_19,"Aw, c'mon!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_20,Why were you so obsessed about having good luck then?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_21,I was kinda jealous cause I thought you'd hit it big.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_22,I'm going to take part in the event organized by Coin Rush.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_23,OMG!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_24,The one where the winner gets a smooch from Noir and Blanc?
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_25,So THAT'S why you want lady luck on your side.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_26,"Pssh, figures."
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_27,I thought there'd be more to it than that.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_28,"Well, good luck anyway."
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_29,"Actually, you know..."
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_30,I'll be happy with second place.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_31,I'll try.
m_ex_bunnyx777_02_32,May fortune smile upon you... and me!
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_1,"Hey, Pit Boss,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_2,did you get back safe?
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_3,"We wanted to escort you to Commander's Room,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_4,but it turned out you had to walk us back to the dormitory. Thanks.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_5,You're welcome.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_6,"We were supposed to give you good luck,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_7,"but I guess it was the other way around, lol"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_8,Tomorrow is the big day. Are you tired?
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_9,I didn't realize it was so late :p
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_10,"It's okay, I've got plenty of energy."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_11,Haha!
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_12,:D
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_13,Thanks for all your help.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_14,Sorry to have bothered you.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_15,How can we ever repay you?
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_16,Don't stress too much about the competition.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_17,"Even if you don't win, it's okay."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_18,We're just grateful that you're willing to show up for us.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_19,"Yeah, super grateful!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_20,"I doubt we'll have a lot of time to interact with you tomorrow,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_21,but just remember that we're cheering for you.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_22,"Yeah, we'll be thinking about you!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_23,"We certainly will, the whole day!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_24,"Thanks, everyone."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_25,Sleep well.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_26,See you tomorrow.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_27,Don't forget to dream about me.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_28,"Good night, and good luck."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_29,"Lol, sure thing!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_30,See you in our dreams.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_31,"Wow, you sound like a radio presenter."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_32,"Can't wait to see the face behind that voice, hehe!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_33,"Blanc, Noir."
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_34,We have to get up earlier tomorrow.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_35,Go to bed.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_36,You got it.
m_ex_bunnyx777_03_37,See you all tomorrow!!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_1,Pit Boss!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_2,I keep thinking about that day.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_3,Same here!
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_4,Me too.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_5,??
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_6,What day?
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_7,The day of the event?
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_8,Yeah.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_9,It was quite the shindig.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_10,A real barn burner.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_11,You bet.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_12,????
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_13,What?
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_14,"You were there too, Rouge?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_15,Of course I was.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_16,"You saw me,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_17,don't you remember?
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_18,??????
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_19,"You mean, Pit Boss"
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_20,and the ki...
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_21,I was the hostess
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_22,of the last game.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_23,"When I saw those three sevens pop up in the final round,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_24,I was so shocked that I could hardly breathe.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_25,Oh.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_26,Thjat.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_27,Typo. That.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_28,"Yeah, the last game was really awesome."
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_29,Yep yep yep
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_30,Pit Boss nailed it!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_31,Thanks :p
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_32,...
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_33,You all are acting pretty strange.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_34,"Well, Noir and I need to practice our pole dancing routine."
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_35,Be there in a sec.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_36,All right.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_37,I've got other work to do anyway.
m_ex_bunnyx777_04_38,"Keep up the good work, everyone."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_1,"Highroller,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_2,Mustang wants to tell us something.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_3,I'll invite him to the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_4,Rouge has invited Mustang to join the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_5,EEEntertainment!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_6,Désolé! Sorry for the sudden irruption.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_7,"I heard about this blah group and I have something to say to vous,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_8,so I asked Rouge to add me.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_9,Go on.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_10,It's about l' homme I took away.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_11,"After some discussion, we décidé to have him work at Coin Rush on a volunteer basis."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_12,"However,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_13,erm...
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_14,"Actually, it would be better for him to tell you."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_15,Mustang has invited Sullen Man to join the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_16,"H-hey,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_17,everyone.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_18,How's everybody doing?
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_19,Hey!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_20,Long time no see!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_21,"We're great, thanks."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_22,Glad to hear that.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_23,So...
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_24,"First of all, I want to apologize."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_25,Especially to {AccountData.NickName}.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_26,I'm sorry for losing my temper and acting so suspiciously.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_27,I never got the chance to talk to you on the day of the event.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_28,It's okay.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_29,I'd like to thank everyone else who's in here as well.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_30,"I'm a much happier person now,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_31,and it's thanks to you all.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_32,You helped yourself. We just gave you a little push.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_33,Right!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_34,"It doesn't matter how much luck we imparted to you,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_35,none of it would do anything if you didn't want to change.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_36,You don't understand.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_37,That was the first time anyone has given me any form of encouragement.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_38,"I never knew how to take the first step towards self-improvement, so I always stayed put."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_39,"So once again,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_40,"thank you, everyone."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_41,He's recently started his internship here at the casino. C'est magnifique!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_42,"He's a happy fellow, and I've come out the other end with a talented new employee. C'est fantastique!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_43,That's all I have to say.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_44,"See you, guys!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_45,Mustang left the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_46,"Have a wonderful day, everyone."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_47,Sullen Man left the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_48,"Aww, isn't that wonderful?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_49,I haven't been this happy in a long time.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_50,Aww...
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_51,I'm getting emotional...
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_52,"If you ask me, he's the real winner here."
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_53,He's sure to succeed.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_54,Noir!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_55,We've gotta put on one heck of a show tonight!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_56,You got it!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_57,I'm all riled up now! In a good way!
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_58,Just don't overdo it and sprain something.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_59,Sure thing.
m_ex_bunnyx777_05_60,Right!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_1,"Highroller,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_2,I'm a little curious.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_3,How did you beat Blanc
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_4,in rock paper scissors?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_5,Huh?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_6,Why do you want to know?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_7,I've never beaten you more than once in a row.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_8,Really?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_9,"The three sevens were pretty amazing,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_10,but I'm most intrigued by your rock paper scissors technique.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_11,You could say I've been obsessing over it lately :/
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_12,"Actually, I was pretty surprised myself"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_13,that you managed to win three times in a row.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_14,What's your secret?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_15,Rock paper scissors is all about mind games.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_16,It was just dumb luck.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_17,"Whoa, no kidding?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_18,How do you do it?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_19,"Generally speaking, you can tell what someone is about to throw by looking at their hands."
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_20,How so?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_21,Your hand tends to relax a bit before throwing scissors.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_22,"Wow, really?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_23,"Meanwhile, your hand tends to tense up if you're going with rock."
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_24,No kidding...
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_25,So you were able to notice all of these subtle movements while you were playing the game?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_26,That's amazing!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_27,Just kidding.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_28,Huh?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_29,I just got lucky.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_30,Oh... is that so...
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_31,Wait a minute.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_32,"You must have had Blanc and Noir help you out beforehand, didn't you?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_33,Yep!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_34,We gave his luck a jump start!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_35,"Well, aren't you two just"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_36,the epitome of luck?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_37,Where are you right now?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_38,Hanging out in the dormitory.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_39,Why?
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_40,Today's coin flip was tails.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_41,Give me some luck! I need it!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_42,Fill 'er up!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_43,I'm coming over.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_44,"Nope, sorry."
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_45,Only Pit Boss can do that.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_46,"Oh, you don't say?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_47,Then I'll have them come with me.
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_48,Hold on!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_49,What???
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_50,We're not even dressed yet!!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_51,"We'd better put on something before they come, Blanc."
m_ex_bunnyx777_06_52,Okay.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_1,Pit Boss.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_2,You still remember the kiss Noir and I gave you after you won first place?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_3,You bet I do.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_4,How's your luck been holding up?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_5,Not too bad.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_6,Then can we test it?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_7,"I'm a little curious, that's all, hehe."
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_8,How?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_9,Hmm...
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_10,I've got it!
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_11,I have something in my hand.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_12,Can you guess what it is?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_13,Chocolate Splendamin.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_14,A rabbit toy that looks like Noir.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_15,???!!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_16,Wow!
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_17,Amazing...
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_18,Are you serious?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_19,"Okay, how about this?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_20,Do we have a show in Coin Rush today?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_21,Yes.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_22,No.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_23,!!!!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_24,"OMG!!! That's amazing, Pit Boss!!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_25,You were correct both times.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_26,This is beyond luck.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_27,I think Highroller is clairvoyant.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_28,I don't think so.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_29,Because he was actually wrong both times.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_30,"Wait, what?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_31,I was wrong?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_32,LOLOLOL
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_33,LOLOLOL
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_34,What is this?
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_35,"Don't be too mad. When you think about it, us being able"
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_36,to have such fun together is the luckiest thing of all.
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_37,"Well well, aren't you a sweet-talker?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_38,Hehe!
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_39,"We've had so much fun hanging around with you, Pit Boss."
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_40,"Yeah, tons of fun."
m_ex_bunnyx777_07_41,I suppose things can't be all that bad if Noir and Blanc are this gleeful.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_1,Commander.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_2,You won first place?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_3,Yeah.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_4,Let's goooo!
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_5,And you got a kiss from Blanc and Noir?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_6,Uh-huh.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_7,How was it?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_8,You feeling lucky?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_9,Are you jealous?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_10,Hmm?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_11,Jealous?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_12,Me?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_13,...
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_14,Of course I am!
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_15,You were swapping spit with two women at the same time.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_16,How do you expect me to be happy about that?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_17,"Well congratulations, you're one step closer to forming your very own harem."
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_18,Where are you now?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_19,Now?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_20,Why?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_21,I'd like you to give me some luck as well.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_22,Why me?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_23,"If anything, I'm the epitome of misfortune."
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_24,Then I have to share my luck with you.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_25,When did you learn to be such a smooth talker?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_26,Does flattery value go hand in hand with how lucky you are?
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_27,Fine.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_28,"I'm a bit far away right now, but..."
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_29,...
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_30,I'll catch you later.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_31,Don't forget to have some soda ready for me in your room.
m_ex_bunnyx777_08_32,It really does feel like my luck has turned lately.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_1,Rouge has invited Rupee to join the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_2,Rouge has invited Viper to join the group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_3,??
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_4,"Per Mustang's request, I have added Rupee and Viper to the group chat."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_5,Hello everyone!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_6,Thanks for inviting me! :)
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_7,"Cool, now the group'll be more lively!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_8,Greetings!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_9,Why did Mustang want them in the group all of a sudden?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_10,"Don't tell me you've already forgotten, Sweetie!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_11,Didn't we talk about this before?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_12,Mustang is coming up with a new event.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_13,One that we decided to participate in.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_14,"I'm Viper, a bunny with a venomous bite!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_15,"And I'm Rupee, the most luxurious bunny of them all!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_16,"Not bad, huh?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_17,Awesome!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_18,"Then I'll be Blanc, the adorable white bunny."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_19,That suits you perfectly.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_20,I'm not sure I agree.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_21,"I don't feel there's a place for me in this conversation,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_22,so perhaps I should bow out and let everyone chat amongst themselves.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_23,"Well, I'm going to exit the group."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_24,!!!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_25,But why?!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_26,"Yeah, why?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_27,You're the main focus of this entire group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_28,Me?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_29,That's right!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_30,"Four bunnies, or hares, if you will, fight amongst themselves for the favor of one solitary tortoise."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_31,"That's you, Sweetie, hehe!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_32,Why wasn't I made aware of this?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_33,"We only just heard about it ourselves,"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_34,right before we were invited to this group.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_35,She's right.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_36,I didn't know about it either.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_37,Me neither.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_38,Isn't this all a bit... inappropriate?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_39,Let's work hard and make this event just as big a success as the last!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_40,We're gonna have a blast!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_41,Let me confirm the dates first.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_42,"Noir and I can help you with any luck that you need, Pit Boss."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_43,"Yeah, we're here whenever you need us!"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_44,"Unfortunately, it seems that the event has already..."
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_45,"Where are you, Pit Boss?"
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_46,In the Commander's Room?
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_47,No! I think he's in the park.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_48,Right!
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_49,Nobody is listening to me.
m_ex_bunnyx777_09_50,... So much for my luck.
m_ex_noir_01_1,H-hello...
m_ex_noir_01_2,Pit Boss.
m_ex_noir_01_3,I'm Noir from the 777 Squad.
m_ex_noir_01_4,I heard I'm going to be working with you.
m_ex_noir_01_5,I'm looking forward to it!
m_ex_noir_01_6,Same here.
m_ex_noir_01_7,Great!
m_ex_noir_01_8,So...
m_ex_noir_01_9,Erm...
m_ex_noir_01_10,...
m_ex_noir_01_11,"Hehe, sorry."
m_ex_noir_01_12,I'm a bit self-conscious.
m_ex_noir_01_13,I don't usually chat one-on-one with people on blah like this.
m_ex_noir_01_14,"Well, not just on blah..."
m_ex_noir_01_15,"Ugh, I don't know what I'm saying."
m_ex_noir_01_16,I'm sorry :/
m_ex_noir_01_17,Don't worry. Relax. You can say whatever comes to mind.
m_ex_noir_01_18,Thanks.
m_ex_noir_01_19,"Oh, right."
m_ex_noir_01_20,Have you been to Coin Rush before?
m_ex_noir_01_21,Yes.
m_ex_noir_01_22,No.
m_ex_noir_01_23,You have?
m_ex_noir_01_24,Then you know what a fun place it can be.
m_ex_noir_01_25,You haven't?
m_ex_noir_01_26,There're all sorts of games that you can play.
m_ex_noir_01_27,"It's a fun place, and we're always holding different events."
m_ex_noir_01_28,Blanc and I also perform there.
m_ex_noir_01_29,The two of us do a synchronized pole dance.
m_ex_noir_01_30,We do all sorts of different moves.
m_ex_noir_01_31,Sounds cool.
m_ex_noir_01_32,Not really :'(
m_ex_noir_01_33,"Blanc is cool, though."
m_ex_noir_01_34,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_noir_01_35,Do you know who Blanc is?
m_ex_noir_01_36,She's my twin sister.
m_ex_noir_01_37,She's got fair skin.
m_ex_noir_01_38,"She's slim,"
m_ex_noir_01_39,"pretty,"
m_ex_noir_01_40,and kind.
m_ex_noir_01_41,She's like an angel.
m_ex_noir_01_42,I've heard of her.
m_ex_noir_01_43,"I should have known you would, haha."
m_ex_noir_01_44,Everyone knows about Blanc and how attractive she is.
m_ex_noir_01_45,"Oh, jeez."
m_ex_noir_01_46,Sorry.
m_ex_noir_01_47,I'm blabbering too much.
m_ex_noir_01_48,"No, it's okay."
m_ex_noir_01_49,You're too kind :)
m_ex_noir_01_50,"Anyways, I'll reach out when Blanc and I have a performance."
m_ex_noir_01_51,"If you have time, you're more than welcome to come see us."
m_ex_noir_01_52,I'll do that.
m_ex_noir_01_53,Sounds good!
m_ex_noir_01_54,"I'll see you around, then."
m_ex_noir_02_1,"Pit Boss,"
m_ex_noir_02_2,have you seen Blanc?
m_ex_noir_02_3,Isn't she usually with you?
m_ex_noir_02_4,"Usually, yes."
m_ex_noir_02_5,But she didn't show up for practice.
m_ex_noir_02_6,"She's 10 minutes late already,"
m_ex_noir_02_7,and I haven't been able to reach her.
m_ex_noir_02_8,I thought you might know where she is.
m_ex_noir_02_9,"Sorry, but I've got no idea."
m_ex_noir_02_10,Okay...
m_ex_noir_02_11,Do you think something happened?
m_ex_noir_02_12,She may just be running late.
m_ex_noir_02_13,Hmm...
m_ex_noir_02_14,"That might be the case, but"
m_ex_noir_02_15,"if she is late, she usually lets me know."
m_ex_noir_02_16,Maybe she just forgot.
m_ex_noir_02_17,What?!
m_ex_noir_02_18,That's concerning...
m_ex_noir_02_19,We were supposed to run through our moves for the upcoming performance.
m_ex_noir_02_20,"It's two days from now, so we don't have a lot of time."
m_ex_noir_02_21,Hmm...
m_ex_noir_02_22,Ah-hah!
m_ex_noir_02_23,Pit Boss.
m_ex_noir_02_24,Yes?
m_ex_noir_02_25,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_noir_02_26,Not really.
m_ex_noir_02_27,In that case...
m_ex_noir_02_28,...
m_ex_noir_02_29,Could...
m_ex_noir_02_30,Could you maybe...
m_ex_noir_02_31,"If I leave it to Noir to finish her question, we'll be here all day."
m_ex_noir_02_32,Do you want me to check your moves for you instead?
m_ex_noir_02_33,Yeah.
m_ex_noir_02_34,Only if it's okay with you.
m_ex_noir_02_35,I'd be incredibly grateful.
m_ex_noir_02_36,"You've seen our performance many times before, so"
m_ex_noir_02_37,I'm sure you'd notice if something was off.
m_ex_noir_02_38,Could you make it to the practice room in... say... an hour?
m_ex_noir_02_39,You got it.
m_ex_noir_02_40,Hm.
m_ex_noir_02_41,"If Blanc contacts you before then,"
m_ex_noir_02_42,"or if you happen to run into her,"
m_ex_noir_02_43,please tell her to contact me ASAP!
m_ex_noir_02_44,"I'm sure nothing is wrong, but I'm just worried."
m_ex_noir_02_45,Understood.
m_ex_noir_02_46,Thank you!
m_ex_noir_02_47,I'll see you later.
m_ex_noir_03_1,"Pit Boss,"
m_ex_noir_03_2,"I was walking through the park,"
m_ex_noir_03_3,and a guy who said he was a fan asked me for a handshake.
m_ex_noir_03_4,And?
m_ex_noir_03_5,It's just that...
m_ex_noir_03_6,"I was so shy,"
m_ex_noir_03_7,that I ended up apologizing
m_ex_noir_03_8,and running away.
m_ex_noir_03_9,:'(
m_ex_noir_03_10,I could see the disappointment in his eyes.
m_ex_noir_03_11,"When I think about it, I feel so bad."
m_ex_noir_03_12,Do you think there's any way I could make it up to him?
m_ex_noir_03_13,"Unless you're able to track that person down, it's going to be pretty difficult."
m_ex_noir_03_14,I thought so too...
m_ex_noir_03_15,"Ugh, why am I always like this?"
m_ex_noir_03_16,Do you think there is a way to fix this?
m_ex_noir_03_17,"I already know that if this happened tomorrow, I'd do the exact same thing again."
m_ex_noir_03_18,Just imagine that the person in front of you is me.
m_ex_noir_03_19,Just envision the person in front of you as a rock.
m_ex_noir_03_20,Erm...
m_ex_noir_03_21,I don't know...
m_ex_noir_03_22,I think that'd only make me more nervous :/
m_ex_noir_03_23,"Having said that,"
m_ex_noir_03_24,I do feel awfully comfortable whenever I'm talking to you...
m_ex_noir_03_25,A rock?
m_ex_noir_03_26,...
m_ex_noir_03_27,I...
m_ex_noir_03_28,I could talk to a rock no problem!
m_ex_noir_03_29,"It's not like a rock has feelings, after all."
m_ex_noir_03_30,I think this method might just work out!
m_ex_noir_03_31,"It's settled, then."
m_ex_noir_03_32,"If anyone approaches me,"
m_ex_noir_03_33,I'll do exactly what you said.
m_ex_noir_03_34,Then I won't be flustered.
m_ex_noir_03_35,Well...
m_ex_noir_03_36,"at least not AS flustered, anyway."
m_ex_noir_03_37,And I won't leave them feeling disappointed.
m_ex_noir_03_38,I'm positive this will work.
m_ex_noir_03_39,Oooh!
m_ex_noir_03_40,Thank you!
m_ex_noir_03_41,Actually...
m_ex_noir_03_42,Yes?
m_ex_noir_03_43,"If you're so nervous around people, how do you manage to perform in front of a massive crowd so often?"
m_ex_noir_03_44,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_noir_03_45,It's all because of Blanc.
m_ex_noir_03_46,"As long as we're together,"
m_ex_noir_03_47,I can do it too.
m_ex_noir_03_48,How should I put it...
m_ex_noir_03_49,"Once I'm on stage, I feel like I'm someone else."
m_ex_noir_03_50,Someone brimming with confidence.
m_ex_noir_03_51,Sounds to me like you're born to be on the stage.
m_ex_noir_03_52,"Hehe, maybe you're right."
m_ex_noir_03_53,"You're making me blush, Pit Boss..."
m_ex_noir_03_54,"Anyway, I can't keep going around snubbing my devoted fans."
m_ex_noir_03_55,I've got to try harder!
m_ex_noir_03_56,I'll be cheering you on all the way.
m_ex_noir_03_57,Thanks!
m_ex_noir_03_58,And thanks for listening to my story.
m_ex_noir_03_59,"Anyway, you should get some rest!"
m_ex_777_01_1,Pit Boss!!
m_ex_777_01_2,Are you busy?
m_ex_777_01_3,Not really.
m_ex_777_01_4,"Okay, great!"
m_ex_777_01_5,What's the matter?
m_ex_777_01_6,Um... Can you join our show?
m_ex_777_01_7,Just this once? T^T
m_ex_777_01_8,Me?
m_ex_777_01_9,Yeah!
m_ex_777_01_10,The one we were supposed to perform with stood us up.
m_ex_777_01_11,Are you sure I'm qualified?
m_ex_777_01_12,Of course!
m_ex_777_01_13,You don't have to do much.
m_ex_777_01_14,"Just stand on the stage,"
m_ex_777_01_15,and Noir and I will take care of the rest.
m_ex_777_01_16,Can you tell me what you're planning on doing?
m_ex_777_01_17,Well...
m_ex_777_01_18,"After the show starts,"
m_ex_777_01_19,I'm going to run my hands over you.
m_ex_777_01_20,Head to toe.
m_ex_777_01_21,"Then Blanc stands behind you, wraps her arms around you, and..."
m_ex_777_01_22,Noir doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_777_01_23,Then what?
m_ex_777_01_24,Well...
m_ex_777_01_25,...
m_ex_777_01_26,I can't.
m_ex_777_01_27,It's so weird talking about this over text.
m_ex_777_01_28,"Lol, don't be silly, Noir."
m_ex_777_01_29,What's there to be embarrassed about?
m_ex_777_01_30,It's just a simple show.
m_ex_777_01_31,"In a nutshell, Pit Boss, we'll be using you as an makeshift pole."
m_ex_777_01_32,"Other than that, it'll be the same show that we put on as always."
m_ex_777_01_33,I see.
m_ex_777_01_34,"I'll take it that's a yes, then?"
m_ex_777_01_35,Um...
m_ex_777_01_36,"Could I sit down, by any chance?"
m_ex_777_01_37,Why?
m_ex_777_01_38,"Yeah, how come?"
m_ex_777_01_39,Er... my legs have been feeling weak lately.
m_ex_777_01_40,I've got stage fright.
m_ex_777_01_41,Huh?
m_ex_777_01_42,You don't say...
m_ex_777_01_43,"In that case, maybe we should find someone else."
m_ex_777_01_44,No! I want to perform with you.
m_ex_777_01_45,Hmm...
m_ex_777_01_46,Are you sure?
m_ex_777_01_47,It'd be great if you could join us.
m_ex_777_01_48,I can.
m_ex_777_01_49,"You see, Noir?"
m_ex_777_01_50,He can't wait to do it!
m_ex_777_01_51,Everything's gonna be fine.
m_ex_777_01_52,I hope so...
m_ex_777_01_53,"Anyway, let us know if you're having any trouble at any point."
m_ex_777_01_54,Your health is far more important than the show.
m_ex_777_01_55,For sure!
m_ex_777_01_56,Could I have a blanket to put over my lap as well?
m_ex_777_01_57,"Huh? It'll be really hot, though..."
m_ex_777_01_58,"Well, if you insist."
m_ex_777_01_59,We're gonna tweak the choreography a bit. We'll let you know when we're done.
m_ex_777_01_60,"It's the first time the other person joining us on stage will be sitting, so we need to change some movements."
m_ex_777_01_61,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
m_ex_777_01_62,You just sit back and relax. We'll handle the rest.
m_ex_777_01_63,"Once we've arranged a new routine, we'll set a date to practice together."
m_ex_777_01_64,Got it.
m_ex_777_01_65,"Thanks, Pit Boss!"
m_ex_777_01_66,You're the best!
m_ex_777_02_1,Pit Boss!
m_ex_777_02_2,You there?
m_ex_777_02_3,I much prefer 'Honey'.
m_ex_777_02_4,I much prefer 'Master'.
m_ex_777_02_5,Hehe.
m_ex_777_02_6,Honey?
m_ex_777_02_7,Sounds kinda weird to me.
m_ex_777_02_8,Blanc! Don't be so rude.
m_ex_777_02_9,"Oh, relax! They don't care."
m_ex_777_02_10,"Anyway, what can I do for you?"
m_ex_777_02_11,If you insist!
m_ex_777_02_12,Master!
m_ex_777_02_13,Yes?
m_ex_777_02_14,Coin Rush is
m_ex_777_02_15,putting on a new show.
m_ex_777_02_16,We need some help with the name.
m_ex_777_02_17,"Right now it's ""The Blanc & Noir Show""."
m_ex_777_02_18,It's waaaay too generic.
m_ex_777_02_19,Have you got any better suggestions?
m_ex_777_02_20,The Ultra-Fantastic Bunny Hour.
m_ex_777_02_21,???
m_ex_777_02_22,???
m_ex_777_02_23,... Just kidding.
m_ex_777_02_24,... I'm not entirely convinced you were.
m_ex_777_02_25,Hahahaha!
m_ex_777_02_26,Any keywords that you want included?
m_ex_777_02_27,We definitely want our names in it.
m_ex_777_02_28,And it'd be nice if we could squeeze in the word 'lucky'.
m_ex_777_02_29,In that case...
m_ex_777_02_30,"Oh boy, I can't wait!"
m_ex_777_02_31,Me neither!
m_ex_777_02_32,Noir & Blanc's Lucky Show.
m_ex_777_02_33,...
m_ex_777_02_34,...
m_ex_777_02_35,"... Er, just kidding. Again."
m_ex_777_02_36,...
m_ex_777_02_37,"Pit Boss, get serious!"
m_ex_777_02_38,Yeah!
m_ex_777_02_39,We want to hear a real suggestion from you.
m_ex_777_02_40,"... Actually, those were both serious suggestions."
m_ex_777_02_41,Pit Boss?
m_ex_777_02_42,Blanc & Noir: The Lucky Bunnies
m_ex_777_02_43,The Good Luck Bunnies
m_ex_777_02_44,Neither of the girls reply for a while.
m_ex_777_02_45,Not a fan?
m_ex_777_02_46,It's not that.
m_ex_777_02_47,Why didn't you reply then?
m_ex_777_02_48,"We're busy preparing for the show, silly!"
m_ex_777_02_49,I thought you had the day off.
m_ex_777_02_50,"Sorry, Pit Boss, but we've kinda got our hands full at the moment."
m_ex_777_02_51,Talk to you later!
m_ex_777_02_52,Thanks for the suggestions!
m_ex_777_02_53,I'll have to check out the promotional posters later to see what they went with.
m_ex_blanc_01_1,Hello!
m_ex_blanc_01_2,I'm Blanc from Squad 777.
m_ex_blanc_01_3,Is this the new Pit Boss of Coin Rush?
m_ex_blanc_01_4,"Yes, it is."
m_ex_blanc_01_5,"Sorry, you've got the wrong guy."
m_ex_blanc_01_6,Seems like you're the man I'm looking for! :)
m_ex_blanc_01_7,Seriously?
m_ex_blanc_01_8,Blanc doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_blanc_01_9,Are you sure?
m_ex_blanc_01_10,I thought for sure I had it right...
m_ex_blanc_01_11,Just kidding :-P
m_ex_blanc_01_12,"Ha, you got me good. I'll have to get you back later!"
m_ex_blanc_01_13,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_blanc_01_14,"As you probably already know, I work in Coin Rush."
m_ex_blanc_01_15,Do you know anything about pole dancing?
m_ex_blanc_01_16,"Yes, I do."
m_ex_blanc_01_17,Not really.
m_ex_blanc_01_18,"Great, then I don't have to explain it."
m_ex_blanc_01_19,"Well,"
m_ex_blanc_01_20,"as the name suggests, I basically dance on a pole."
m_ex_blanc_01_21,Noir and I perform together
m_ex_blanc_01_22,in Coin Rush.
m_ex_blanc_01_23,"Noir is my twin sister, by the way."
m_ex_blanc_01_24,She's way prettier than I am.
m_ex_blanc_01_25,I'll introduce her to you when you come over.
m_ex_blanc_01_26,"Oh jeez, I'm starting to ramble again..."
m_ex_blanc_01_27,Anyway!
m_ex_blanc_01_28,Come and see our shows when you're free.
m_ex_blanc_01_29,It'll be a spectacle for your eyes and ears! Hehe!
m_ex_blanc_01_30,"You'll have a great time, I guarantee it."
m_ex_blanc_01_31,I'm looking forward to it.
m_ex_blanc_01_32,You should!
m_ex_blanc_01_33,Our show is the best in the entire Ark.
m_ex_blanc_01_34,"Also, people say that if you happen to see Noir and I"
m_ex_blanc_01_35,"together at Coin Rush,"
m_ex_blanc_01_36,then good luck will come your way.
m_ex_blanc_01_37,So be sure to come over so you don't miss out!
m_ex_blanc_01_38,Sure thing.
m_ex_blanc_01_39,Call me when you stop by.
m_ex_blanc_01_40,Noir and I will come out to greet you.
m_ex_blanc_01_41,Can't wait to meet you!
m_ex_blanc_01_42,"Well, I've got a show to do."
m_ex_blanc_01_43,See you around!
m_ex_blanc_02_1,Pit Boss!!!
m_ex_blanc_02_2,??
m_ex_blanc_02_3,Are you busy?
m_ex_blanc_02_4,Nope.
m_ex_blanc_02_5,What are you doing then?
m_ex_blanc_02_6,Thinking about you.
m_ex_blanc_02_7,Thinking about Noir.
m_ex_blanc_02_8,What?!!
m_ex_blanc_02_9,What about me? ;)
m_ex_blanc_02_10,"Actually, I was thinking about you."
m_ex_blanc_02_11,Whoa! Really?
m_ex_blanc_02_12,Don't forget about Noir.
m_ex_blanc_02_13,What's up?
m_ex_blanc_02_14,"We don't have any shows today,"
m_ex_blanc_02_15,so I just wanted to see if... y'know...
m_ex_blanc_02_16,Fancy going out on a date?
m_ex_blanc_02_17,The weather's lovely today.
m_ex_blanc_02_18,I can't today.
m_ex_blanc_02_19,Where do you want to go?
m_ex_blanc_02_20,Really? :'(
m_ex_blanc_02_21,That's too bad...
m_ex_blanc_02_22,"I won a hotel voucher in one of our contests,"
m_ex_blanc_02_23,so I thought we could go on a mini-vacation.
m_ex_blanc_02_24,Guess I'll have to go alone.
m_ex_blanc_02_25,"... Actually, I think I can go after all."
m_ex_blanc_02_26,Huh?
m_ex_blanc_02_27,I'm sure I can pencil you in.
m_ex_blanc_02_28,Are you sure it won't throw your schedule out of whack?
m_ex_blanc_02_29,It's no problem. Is it just going to be the two of us?
m_ex_blanc_02_30,To the hotel!
m_ex_blanc_02_31,The hotel?
m_ex_blanc_02_32,Yep! I won a hotel voucher in one of our contests.
m_ex_blanc_02_33,The voucher is good for three people.
m_ex_blanc_02_34,So I figured Noir could join us.
m_ex_blanc_02_35,Rouge is too busy to go :/
m_ex_blanc_02_36,"All right, let's go."
m_ex_blanc_02_37,Sounds good!
m_ex_blanc_02_38,"Actually, I just remembered"
m_ex_blanc_02_39,Noir hasn't finished her shift yet.
m_ex_blanc_02_40,We may have to wait until a bit later to go.
m_ex_blanc_02_41,I'll let you know as soon as she gets off work.
m_ex_blanc_02_42,"Okay, just don't make me wait too long."
m_ex_blanc_02_43,I won't!
m_ex_blanc_03_1,Pit Boss!
m_ex_blanc_03_2,Someone...
m_ex_blanc_03_3,told me they had a crush on me.
m_ex_blanc_03_4,This is the first this has ever happened. It was so awkward...
m_ex_blanc_03_5,Who was it?
m_ex_blanc_03_6,One of my fans.
m_ex_blanc_03_7,"Sorry, but I won't allow it. You're my girl."
m_ex_blanc_03_8,Why don't you just turn him down?
m_ex_blanc_03_9,Huh?
m_ex_blanc_03_10,I'm yours?
m_ex_blanc_03_11,Haha!
m_ex_blanc_03_12,You're pretty funny.
m_ex_blanc_03_13,"If I were you, I'd just turn them down."
m_ex_blanc_03_14,Of course I rejected him.
m_ex_blanc_03_15,"For one thing, dating fans is a big no-no."
m_ex_blanc_03_16,"And besides that, this guy already tried the same thing with Noir before."
m_ex_blanc_03_17,He did?
m_ex_blanc_03_18,Yeah...
m_ex_blanc_03_19,"Noir turned him down, too."
m_ex_blanc_03_20,"Once that happened, he turned around and tried the same trick with me."
m_ex_blanc_03_21,"A few days ago, he started waiting for us backstage until our shows were over."
m_ex_blanc_03_22,"He sent me gifts, flowers, letters, and so on."
m_ex_blanc_03_23,"While I appreciate it,"
m_ex_blanc_03_24,"it also feels a bit suffocating, so I turned him down."
m_ex_blanc_03_25,I told him that him cheering from the sidelines was more than enough.
m_ex_blanc_03_26,"But the other day, he ended up storming the stage!"
m_ex_blanc_03_27,"Once he was there, he said he had feelings for me."
m_ex_blanc_03_28,I can't even begin to tell you how embarrassing it was for me.
m_ex_blanc_03_29,He said he wouldn't get off the stage until I agreed to be with him.
m_ex_blanc_03_30,So I told him that I already had a boyfriend.
m_ex_blanc_03_31,"Once he heard that, he slunk off with his tail between his legs."
m_ex_blanc_03_32,"Now he says he doesn't believe me,"
m_ex_blanc_03_33,and he's insisting that I give him proof that I have a boyfriend.
m_ex_blanc_03_34,"Otherwise, he'll think I'm making the whole thing up."
m_ex_blanc_03_35,"So the question is, how do I get a boyfriend?"
m_ex_blanc_03_36,I can pretend to be your boyfriend.
m_ex_blanc_03_37,Huh?
m_ex_blanc_03_38,You will?
m_ex_blanc_03_39,Are you sure it's okay?
m_ex_blanc_03_40,Coin Rush's customers can be intimidating.
m_ex_blanc_03_41,I want to protect you. That's all that matters.
m_ex_blanc_03_42,I assure you that I can be far more intimidating than them if I want to.
m_ex_blanc_03_43,Ha!
m_ex_blanc_03_44,I'm so relieved.
m_ex_blanc_03_45,I'll try and take care of it myself first.
m_ex_blanc_03_46,"If it doesn't work, I'll come to you."
m_ex_blanc_03_47,I'll be around if you need me.
m_ex_blanc_03_48,All right!
m_ex_blanc_03_49,I appreciate all the advice.
m_ex_blanc_03_50,"I've never encountered anything like this before, so I wasn't sure who to text."
m_ex_blanc_03_51,Hopefully this'll solve the problem.
m_ex_blanc_03_52,Thanks for the reassurance.
m_ex_blanc_03_53,I'll try and let him down easy.
m_ex_blanc_03_54,"Thanks, Pit Boss!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_1,{AccountData.NickName}-kun
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_2,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_3,"If you're free today,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_4,how about having a cup of tea with me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_5,"I have some new tea leaves,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_6,and I'd like to try them with you.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_7,Are you inviting just me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_8,Sakura doesn't answer for a while.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_9,Whoops.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_10,I thought I'd sent a personal message to just you.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_11,Apparently I accidently sent it to the group chat.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_12,Rosanna
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_13,Moran
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_14,"If either of you want to come, that's fine with me."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_15,"Of course, not coming is also an option..."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_16,"Oof, I can read between the lines."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_17,I know when I'm not wanted.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_18,"However, if Mister is going,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_19,then I've gotta tag along.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_20,I'm going too.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_21,Any chance I could have whiskey instead of tea?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_22,On the rocks.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_23,"Sorry, I don't have whiskey on hand."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_24,You don't?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_25,"That's okay, any alcohol will do."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_26,We don't have any alcoholic beverages here.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_27,You're kidding.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_28,"As I said earlier,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_29,"if there isn't anything that appeals to you, you don't HAVE to come."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_30,"Well then,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_31,it appears my hands are tied.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_32,Perhaps I will indulge in a nice cup of tea. Sounds fancy.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_33,"When are you going, Mister?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_34,Right now.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_35,Can you hold up for a moment?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_36,There's something I've gotta take care of.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_37,"Once I'm finished, I'll head over to the Commander's Room."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_38,We can go together.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_39,"All right, I'll wait for you to get here."
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_40,"Since Moran isn't replying,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_41,we'll consider her a no-show.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_42,I'll prepare enough tea for just the three of us.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_43,See you soon.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_44,Sounds good.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_45,Wait!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_46,I just sw!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_47,Saw*
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_48,What're you guys talking about?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_49,Let me read all the other messages.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_50,I wanna go!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_51,Lemme go! Pretty please?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_52,Nobody is answering.
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_53,Heyyyyyy!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_54,I said I wanna go too!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_55,Rosanna!!!!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_56,Sakura!!!!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_57,Cadet!!!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_58,Why isn't anyone answering?
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_59,I know you guys are reading this!
m_ex_underworldqueen_01_60,... I should probably refrain from answering for the time being as well.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_1,Hey
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_2,Has anyone been in contact with Sakura?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_3,??
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_4,Good grief...
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_5,What is her problem?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_6,She hasn't been answering her phone or responding to texts.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_7,Is this Rosanna?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_8,"Are you all right, Sakura?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_9,Ha!
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_10,You knew right away.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_11,"If you know me that well, that must mean you love me bunches and bunches!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_12,"Mister, I'm disappointed!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_13,You can't differentiate Sakura and me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_14,... Is this Rosanna by any chance?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_15,Bingo!
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_16,Did you take each other's phones?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_17,Correctamundo.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_18,"I was leaving Sakura's house in a hurry,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_19,and I wasn't paying attention.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_20,I wonder...
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_21,"do you think she knows that I've got her phone,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_22,and she has mine?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_23,There's no response from Sakura.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_24,How about going back to Sakura's house?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_25,She isn't home.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_26,"She's one busy bee, that's for sure."
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_27,Where's she gone off to now?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_28,"Sorry, I was out and about running errands."
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_29,I only checked my phone just now.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_30,You should check your phone more often!
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_31,"I'm a busy woman, you know."
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_32,What if I end up missing an important call
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_33,because of you?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_34,No one's called you yet.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_35,You're not as popular as you think.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_36,Lol
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_37,Lololololol
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_38,"Oh man, this is fantastic!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_39,Good grief.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_40,How'd you two numbskulls manage to pull a switcheroo with your phones?
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_41,...
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_42,It's pretty rich
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_43,hearing that from you!
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_44,Exactly.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_45,"That's what I'm saying! Typically, I'm the one making a fool out of myself."
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_46,"You should change the way you speak, Rosanna."
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_47,The way Sakura speaks really matches your profile pic.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_48,...
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_49,Moran.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_50,"Just shut up, okay?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_51,We're talking here!
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_52,Don't say that with my phone.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_53,LOL
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_54,Ugh...
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_55,Sakura
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_56,I'll send someone over to retrieve my phone.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_57,All right.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_58,I'm at the park.
m_ex_underworldqueen_02_59,You can send them here.
m_ex_rosanna_01_1,"Hi, Mister."
m_ex_rosanna_01_2,Did you hear the news?
m_ex_rosanna_01_3,I didn't hear anything.
m_ex_rosanna_01_4,Is this Rosanna?
m_ex_rosanna_01_5,You haven't?
m_ex_rosanna_01_6,Guess news travels slow over there.
m_ex_rosanna_01_7,It is.
m_ex_rosanna_01_8,"I'm Rosanna, head of Hedonia."
m_ex_rosanna_01_9,The only people I harm are my enemies.
m_ex_rosanna_01_10,So there isn't any reason for me to hurt you.
m_ex_rosanna_01_11,"That would change swiftly, however, if you were to betray me."
m_ex_rosanna_01_12,I don't intend on doing that.
m_ex_rosanna_01_13,Good.
m_ex_rosanna_01_14,"I'm normally a very guarded person,"
m_ex_rosanna_01_15,but I oddly feel like I can trust you.
m_ex_rosanna_01_16,"Maybe it's because you're my type, hehe."
m_ex_rosanna_01_17,"Anyway, I look forward to working with you."
m_ex_rosanna_01_18,Likewise.
m_ex_rosanna_01_19,"Well, now that we've been properly introduced,"
m_ex_rosanna_01_20,we should get to know each other a little bit more.
m_ex_rosanna_01_21,What are some things you enjoy doing?
m_ex_rosanna_01_22,What do you like?
m_ex_rosanna_01_23,Feel free to tell me anything.
m_ex_rosanna_01_24,You're my favorite.
m_ex_rosanna_01_25,How about we just get acquainted with each other naturally?
m_ex_rosanna_01_26,...
m_ex_rosanna_01_27,I see you're someone who could talk their way out of any situation.
m_ex_rosanna_01_28,Isn't that right?
m_ex_rosanna_01_29,What?
m_ex_rosanna_01_30,Are you putting up a wall?
m_ex_rosanna_01_31,How adorable.
m_ex_rosanna_01_32,Fine.
m_ex_rosanna_01_33,I'll find out about you soon enough.
m_ex_rosanna_01_34,"We'll do as you say,"
m_ex_rosanna_01_35,and take things slow.
m_ex_rosanna_01_36,We're in no hurry.
m_ex_rosanna_01_37,We'll meet soon.
m_ex_rosanna_01_38,Take care until then.
m_ex_rosanna_02_1,Mister
m_ex_rosanna_02_2,Where are you?
m_ex_rosanna_02_3,I'm in the Commander's Room.
m_ex_rosanna_02_4,Why are you still there?
m_ex_rosanna_02_5,??
m_ex_rosanna_02_6,Don't tell me
m_ex_rosanna_02_7,you've forgotten our plans?
m_ex_rosanna_02_8,What plans?
m_ex_rosanna_02_9,Ugh...
m_ex_rosanna_02_10,I can't believe you actually forgot.
m_ex_rosanna_02_11,I guess I'm the only one who was taking this seriously.
m_ex_rosanna_02_12,"No matter how hard I rack my brain, I can't remember what I promised Rosanna."
m_ex_rosanna_02_13,"Sorry, but I'm coming up blank."
m_ex_rosanna_02_14,Good grief!
m_ex_rosanna_02_15,You really don't remember at all?
m_ex_rosanna_02_16,Didn't my subordinate say anything to you?
m_ex_rosanna_02_17,Nobody told me anything.
m_ex_rosanna_02_18,Rosanna doesn't reply.
m_ex_rosanna_02_19,Rosanna?
m_ex_rosanna_02_20,My apologies.
m_ex_rosanna_02_21,My subordinate didn't do his job.
m_ex_rosanna_02_22,It seems my message wasn't properly relayed to you.
m_ex_rosanna_02_23,"... You're not going to kill your subordinate, are you?"
m_ex_rosanna_02_24,"... You're not going to shoot your subordinate, are you?"
m_ex_rosanna_02_25,That's none of your concern.
m_ex_rosanna_02_26,"At any rate, he'll live,"
m_ex_rosanna_02_27,so don't worry too much.
m_ex_rosanna_02_28,So... what were these plans?
m_ex_rosanna_02_29,Well...
m_ex_rosanna_02_30,It's a little weird
m_ex_rosanna_02_31,saying this to you myself.
m_ex_rosanna_02_32,Why don't you take a guess?
m_ex_rosanna_02_33,Watch a movie together?
m_ex_rosanna_02_34,Have dinner together?
m_ex_rosanna_02_35,Such an innocent guess!
m_ex_rosanna_02_36,I'm afraid you're incorrect.
m_ex_rosanna_02_37,Can I have a hint?
m_ex_rosanna_02_38,A hint?
m_ex_rosanna_02_39,"All right, fine."
m_ex_rosanna_02_40,I'll give you a few keywords.
m_ex_rosanna_02_41,Night.
m_ex_rosanna_02_42,Whiskey.
m_ex_rosanna_02_43,Hotel.
m_ex_rosanna_02_44,Is that enough?
m_ex_rosanna_02_45,... Should I go to the hotel right now?
m_ex_rosanna_02_46,Feel free to stop by anytime.
m_ex_rosanna_02_47,I'll prepare the whiskey.
m_ex_rosanna_02_48,What are we going to do once I get there?
m_ex_rosanna_02_49,"Mister, please."
m_ex_rosanna_02_50,Are you really that dense?
m_ex_rosanna_02_51,Night. Alcohol. Hotel.
m_ex_rosanna_02_52,What do you think we'll be doing?
m_ex_rosanna_02_53,I suggest you come quickly.
m_ex_rosanna_02_54,"If you're too late, I won't be here."
m_ex_rosanna_02_55,Room 805.
m_ex_rosanna_02_56,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_rosanna_02_57,And I'm wearing something I think you'll enjoy.
m_ex_rosanna_03_1,"Mister,"
m_ex_rosanna_03_2,do I come off as intimidating?
m_ex_rosanna_03_3,A bit.
m_ex_rosanna_03_4,"Jeez, you didn't even hesitate."
m_ex_rosanna_03_5,I'm surprised.
m_ex_rosanna_03_6,Why do you ask?
m_ex_rosanna_03_7,I had a rather peculiar experience today.
m_ex_rosanna_03_8,"While I was walking on the street,"
m_ex_rosanna_03_9,a kid saw me
m_ex_rosanna_03_10,and dropped his candy.
m_ex_rosanna_03_11,"So, I grabbed the candy and gave it back to him."
m_ex_rosanna_03_12,"I told him to be more careful and hold onto it tightly,"
m_ex_rosanna_03_13,but then he started crying.
m_ex_rosanna_03_14,"I was with some friends, and I asked them for some suggestions"
m_ex_rosanna_03_15,on how to cheer the kid up.
m_ex_rosanna_03_16,"They said smiling should do the trick, so I did."
m_ex_rosanna_03_17,... He took one look at me and ran off crying.
m_ex_rosanna_03_18,You'd think he was being chased by a pack of wild animals.
m_ex_rosanna_03_19,Did you say anything when you were smiling?
m_ex_rosanna_03_20,I didn't say much.
m_ex_rosanna_03_21,I just told him
m_ex_rosanna_03_22,to stop crying.
m_ex_rosanna_03_23,With a smile on your face? I can't even imagine...
m_ex_rosanna_03_24,Stop crying :)
m_ex_rosanna_03_25,Kinda like that.
m_ex_rosanna_03_26,It's hard to express over text.
m_ex_rosanna_03_27,"Anyway,"
m_ex_rosanna_03_28,"kids these days get scared easy, I guess."
m_ex_rosanna_03_29,I don't know how they plan on surviving in this world if that's all it takes to send them into hysterics.
m_ex_rosanna_03_30,"At any rate, I've confirmed"
m_ex_rosanna_03_31,what your first impression of me is.
m_ex_rosanna_03_32,I'll practice some facial expressions
m_ex_rosanna_03_33,before seeing you again.
m_ex_rosanna_03_34,Take care until then.
m_ex_queensorder_01_1,Commander
m_ex_queensorder_01_2,Commander!!1111
m_ex_queensorder_01_3,Master!!!1
m_ex_queensorder_01_4,Where are you?
m_ex_queensorder_01_5,Are you ok?
m_ex_queensorder_01_6,"Yeah, I'm fine."
m_ex_queensorder_01_7,Still alive.
m_ex_queensorder_01_8,Where are you?
m_ex_queensorder_01_9,Did I just hear gunshots in the Commander's Room?! What's going on?
m_ex_queensorder_01_10,I've been joining Rosanna on some missions lately.
m_ex_queensorder_01_11,Rosanna?
m_ex_queensorder_01_12,The one from Underworld Queen?
m_ex_queensorder_01_13,You're gonna end up involved in some seriously dangerous situations!
m_ex_queensorder_01_14,"Master,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_15,"if you've been kidnapped,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_16,"arrested,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_17,"or have someone following you,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_18,"just press ""1"" to let us know."
m_ex_queensorder_01_19,Like this: 11111111111
m_ex_queensorder_01_20,It's nothing like that.
m_ex_queensorder_01_21,Thank goodness.
m_ex_queensorder_01_22,"Do you know how freaked we were, knowing there were bullets flying through the Commander's Room?"
m_ex_queensorder_01_23,I got caught up in some business. Sorry for not keeping everyone in the loop.
m_ex_queensorder_01_24,"Oh boy, sounds like you've gotten yourself in hot water again."
m_ex_queensorder_01_25,You poor thing.
m_ex_queensorder_01_26,"I'll be sticking close to Rosanna, so no need to worry about me."
m_ex_queensorder_01_27,That's easy for you to say!
m_ex_queensorder_01_28,How can you expect us not to worry?
m_ex_queensorder_01_29,But... I presume you must have your reasons for doing this.
m_ex_queensorder_01_30,Right?
m_ex_queensorder_01_31,Commander.
m_ex_queensorder_01_32,"Although we may not know the full picture,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_33,what matters most is that you come back safely.
m_ex_queensorder_01_34,"If you're ever in any kind of danger,"
m_ex_queensorder_01_35,be sure to contact us.
m_ex_queensorder_01_36,Yeah!
m_ex_queensorder_01_37,Don't always keep things to yourself.
m_ex_queensorder_01_38,Give us a ring if you're in a jam!
m_ex_queensorder_01_39,Rain or shine!
m_ex_queensorder_01_40,Okay. Thank you.
m_ex_queensorder_02_1,Agh!
m_ex_queensorder_02_2,Dear Commander.
m_ex_queensorder_02_3,Please responddddddddd
m_ex_queensorder_02_4,Pleaseeeeeeee
m_ex_queensorder_02_5,What are you two doing?
m_ex_queensorder_02_6,We're putting out a signal.
m_ex_queensorder_02_7,"That way, Master will receive our messages no matter where he is."
m_ex_queensorder_02_8,That's right. Doing this will help our messages go through easier.
m_ex_queensorder_02_9,Respondinggggggggg
m_ex_queensorder_02_10,I'm fine.
m_ex_queensorder_02_11,What if I'm not in the mood? Do I still have to respond?
m_ex_queensorder_02_12,Whoa!
m_ex_queensorder_02_13,It worked!
m_ex_queensorder_02_14,"Absolutely. Even if you're in a bad mood, you should respond."
m_ex_queensorder_02_15,Master!!!!!!
m_ex_queensorder_02_16,"The longer the signal, the better!"
m_ex_queensorder_02_17,Commander.
m_ex_queensorder_02_18,"You're not hurt, are you?"
m_ex_queensorder_02_19,"You're not hiding any more gunshots or anything from us,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_20,are you?
m_ex_queensorder_02_21,"You weren't throwing yourself,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_22,"broken, battered and bruised into enemy lines"
m_ex_queensorder_02_23,"while screaming ""firepower"" at the top of your lungs,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_24,were you?
m_ex_queensorder_02_25,On what planet would that possibly happen?
m_ex_queensorder_02_26,You're gonna give him bad luck saying weird stuff like that.
m_ex_queensorder_02_27,Hey!
m_ex_queensorder_02_28,You never know...
m_ex_queensorder_02_29,"I could see it happening,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_30,especially if it was all a ruse cooked up by Master
m_ex_queensorder_02_31,to deceive the enemy.
m_ex_queensorder_02_32,He could pretend to have captured Rosanna and bring her to them.
m_ex_queensorder_02_33,It's totally possible.
m_ex_queensorder_02_34,He would never do something so reckless!
m_ex_queensorder_02_35,...
m_ex_queensorder_02_36,"Right, Commander?"
m_ex_queensorder_02_37,"So, please,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_38,try and keep a low profile during your time with Underworld Queen.
m_ex_queensorder_02_39,"Well, it's just that..."
m_ex_queensorder_02_40,Just that what?
m_ex_queensorder_02_41,What is it?
m_ex_queensorder_02_42,"OMG! You DID scream out ""firepower"", didn't you?"
m_ex_queensorder_02_43,I knew it!
m_ex_queensorder_02_44,Respect!!
m_ex_queensorder_02_45,Respect my ass!
m_ex_queensorder_02_46,"If the Commander did something like that, he might as well hand himself to the enemy on a silver platter."
m_ex_queensorder_02_47,"Is everything okay, Commander?"
m_ex_queensorder_02_48,"Everything's fine, don't worry."
m_ex_queensorder_02_49,"Well, that's a bit reassuring I suppose."
m_ex_queensorder_02_50,As long as you're okay.
m_ex_queensorder_02_51,"It's a bit of a letdown though, since I really do like firepower..."
m_ex_queensorder_02_52,Are you insane? We should be happy the Commander isn't doing the ridiculous things you've described!
m_ex_queensorder_02_53,"Commander, you don't have to be a hero."
m_ex_queensorder_02_54,Don't worry about me. Really.
m_ex_queensorder_02_55,"All right, all right."
m_ex_queensorder_02_56,"I trust you, Commander."
m_ex_queensorder_02_57,"If it's not too much to ask,"
m_ex_queensorder_02_58,"just send us an update every once in a while, like you've done."
m_ex_queensorder_02_59,"Yeah, otherwise we'll be worried sick."
m_ex_queensorder_02_60,"Right, Master."
m_ex_queensorder_02_61,We're all waiting for you to return to the Commander's Room.
m_ex_queensorder_02_62,I'll stay in touch.
m_ex_queensorder_02_63,"Ok, we'll be waiting."
m_ex_queensorder_03_1,Moran has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_queensorder_03_2,Moran has invited Rosanna to join the group.
m_ex_queensorder_03_3,Moran has invited Sakura to join the group.
m_ex_queensorder_03_4,Moran?
m_ex_queensorder_03_5,"Hello, Cadet."
m_ex_queensorder_03_6,Welcome
m_ex_queensorder_03_7,to Underworld Qu
m_ex_queensorder_03_8,"Oh shoot, we're supposed to keep that a secret, aren't we?"
m_ex_queensorder_03_9,"I mean... welcome to the ""No Terrifying People Here"" group chat!"
m_ex_queensorder_03_10,What sort of a name is that?
m_ex_queensorder_03_11,"All right, everybody!!"
m_ex_queensorder_03_12,Since we've all agreed to undertake a super-duper secret operation!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_13,I decided!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_14,To start a new group chat!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_15,For everybody to join!!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_16,What are you talking about?
m_ex_queensorder_03_17,You already invited us into the group.
m_ex_queensorder_03_18,Also...
m_ex_queensorder_03_19,it really isn't necessary to use exclamation marks
m_ex_queensorder_03_20,at the end of every sentence.
m_ex_queensorder_03_21,Huh?
m_ex_queensorder_03_22,"We're using text messages, not voice memos."
m_ex_queensorder_03_23,Using exclamation marks won't make you sound louder.
m_ex_queensorder_03_24,I... I knew that! Duh!
m_ex_queensorder_03_25,I'm not a complete dumb-dumb! Lol
m_ex_queensorder_03_26,As long as you know.
m_ex_queensorder_03_27,"Yeah, what she said."
m_ex_queensorder_03_28,"Jeez, now Cadet's ganging up on me too? :-("
m_ex_queensorder_03_29,Ah
m_ex_queensorder_03_30,"Wait a sec,"
m_ex_queensorder_03_31,Why isn't Rosanna here?
m_ex_queensorder_03_32,I thought I told you.
m_ex_queensorder_03_33,Her phone's broken.
m_ex_queensorder_03_34,"Oh yeah, you did, hehe."
m_ex_queensorder_03_35,"And, like I just told you,"
m_ex_queensorder_03_36,us joining or not joining the group has nothing to do with anything.
m_ex_queensorder_03_37,You already invited us in.
m_ex_queensorder_03_38,"Oh, right. Lololol"
m_ex_queensorder_03_39,What was that you just said about not being dumb?
m_ex_queensorder_03_40,I'm not entirely convinced.
m_ex_queensorder_03_41,Hey!
m_ex_queensorder_03_42,"C'mon, this kinda stuff happens all the time."
m_ex_queensorder_03_43,"Anyhoo, let's talk about something else."
m_ex_queensorder_03_44,"Like... Rosanna, for instance!"
m_ex_queensorder_03_45,Is she okay?
m_ex_queensorder_03_46,What do you think?
m_ex_queensorder_03_47,"She lost countless men from a terrorist bombing,"
m_ex_queensorder_03_48,and numerous civilians under her protection were injured.
m_ex_queensorder_03_49,I doubt she's feeling chipper.
m_ex_queensorder_03_50,"Yeah, guess you've got a point."
m_ex_queensorder_03_51,...
m_ex_queensorder_03_52,Rosanna may join the group
m_ex_queensorder_03_53,after her work is done.
m_ex_queensorder_03_54,Let's all keep our heads on a swivel.
m_ex_queensorder_03_55,Just wait.
m_ex_queensorder_03_56,Why so cautious?
m_ex_queensorder_03_57,Their ultimate objective may not be the partition.
m_ex_queensorder_03_58,"So, Moran and I are going to take a look around"
m_ex_queensorder_03_59,for any unusual movements in the Outer Rim
m_ex_queensorder_03_60,and some back alleys in the Ark.
m_ex_queensorder_03_61,Just to be safe.
m_ex_queensorder_03_62,Thank you for doing this.
m_ex_queensorder_03_63,It's part of the job.
m_ex_queensorder_03_64,We should be the ones thanking you for spending the night in an unfamiliar place.
m_ex_queensorder_03_65,"Yeah, that's right."
m_ex_queensorder_03_66,"I'm sure this hasn't been easy for you, Cadet."
m_ex_queensorder_03_67,I'll take you to my safe house next time!
m_ex_queensorder_03_68,Um... sure.
m_ex_queensorder_03_69,Moran.
m_ex_queensorder_03_70,Don't you think it would be best
m_ex_queensorder_03_71,that we never have to take him to the safe house?
m_ex_queensorder_03_72,"After all, the only reason we would have to go there is if we were in danger."
m_ex_queensorder_03_73,"Uh, well... Yeah!!"
m_ex_queensorder_03_74,You're right!!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_75,Please get your head on straight and stay focused.
m_ex_queensorder_03_76,Rosanna is about to do her thing.
m_ex_queensorder_03_77,Ok!! I'll catch you later!!
m_ex_queensorder_03_78,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_queensorder_03_79,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_queensorder_03_80,Sounds good.
m_ex_queensorder_04_1,Good grief! Why are there so many messages?
m_ex_queensorder_04_2,Just looking at them is giving me a headache.
m_ex_queensorder_04_3,So...
m_ex_queensorder_04_4,you lazy oafs were slacking off while I was working?
m_ex_queensorder_04_5,You must have gotten some shrapnel in your eyes when that bomb went off.
m_ex_queensorder_04_6,"Otherwise, you'd have noticed that we were clearly on guard duty."
m_ex_queensorder_04_7,Perhaps you're due for a visit to the Repair Center?
m_ex_queensorder_04_8,Yeah!!!
m_ex_queensorder_04_9,"We were working, too!!"
m_ex_queensorder_04_10,"All right, fine."
m_ex_queensorder_04_11,"Guard duty counts as work, too."
m_ex_queensorder_04_12,I didn't consider it.
m_ex_queensorder_04_13,"Ah, I just remembered something."
m_ex_queensorder_04_14,??
m_ex_queensorder_04_15,Ingrid and Mustang...
m_ex_queensorder_04_16,Yes?
m_ex_queensorder_04_17,They said they've suppressed the violent incidents.
m_ex_queensorder_04_18,Aha.
m_ex_queensorder_04_19,Go figure.
m_ex_queensorder_04_20,"You morons spent so much energy being glorified security guards,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_21,that no one thought about telling me this valuable intel.
m_ex_queensorder_04_22,So Mustang took care of everything?
m_ex_queensorder_04_23,"If the Central Government had wanted to give us a hard time about this,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_24,they'd have been well within their right to do so.
m_ex_queensorder_04_25,It's great that this was all taken care of nicely and neatly.
m_ex_queensorder_04_26,Mustang's the best!
m_ex_queensorder_04_27,He's A-OK in our book!!!
m_ex_queensorder_04_28,However!!
m_ex_queensorder_04_29,"The most loyal person ever this time around,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_30,was Cadet!
m_ex_queensorder_04_31,"A bit awkwardly worded,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_32,but agreed.
m_ex_queensorder_04_33,"If it weren't for Mister,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_34,I wouldn't be standing here right now.
m_ex_queensorder_04_35,Exactly.
m_ex_queensorder_04_36,Thanks for pushing through all this with us.
m_ex_queensorder_04_37,No problem.
m_ex_queensorder_04_38,You better be grateful.
m_ex_queensorder_04_39,So humble!
m_ex_queensorder_04_40,Of course!
m_ex_queensorder_04_41,So...
m_ex_queensorder_04_42,how about a kiss
m_ex_queensorder_04_43,to repay you?
m_ex_queensorder_04_44,...
m_ex_queensorder_04_45,... No new messages for a while.
m_ex_queensorder_04_46,I can't believe what I'm reading!
m_ex_queensorder_04_47,"Cadet, run!!!"
m_ex_queensorder_04_48,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun, I'm coming to pick you up now."
m_ex_queensorder_04_49,I'm coming too!
m_ex_queensorder_04_50,"Beat it, you two."
m_ex_queensorder_04_51,"Mister and I have built a strong bond now, haven't we?"
m_ex_queensorder_04_52,Be sensible and give us some space.
m_ex_queensorder_04_53,I'd rather be totally senseless
m_ex_queensorder_04_54,than have Cadet snatched away by you!
m_ex_queensorder_04_55,"That's the first smart thing you've said in ages, Moran."
m_ex_queensorder_04_56,I'd rather be a complete moron than lose {AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_queensorder_04_57,"Ha-ha, you sure?"
m_ex_queensorder_04_58,"The fiercer the competition,"
m_ex_queensorder_04_59,the more satisfying the victory.
m_ex_queensorder_04_60,I'm on my way now.
m_ex_queensorder_04_61,"Step on it, girls."
m_ex_queensorder_04_62,What? You're coming right now?
m_ex_queensorder_04_63,"We're on our way, too!"
m_ex_queensorder_04_64,We'll be there soon!
m_ex_queensorder_04_65,...
m_ex_queensorder_04_66,This may get hairy. I better get out of here.
m_ex_queensorder_05_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_2,do you still have the clothes
m_ex_queensorder_05_3,I gave you?
m_ex_queensorder_05_4,They're in my closet. Why?
m_ex_queensorder_05_5,I don't think
m_ex_queensorder_05_6,they really suit you.
m_ex_queensorder_05_7,I want to bring you something else.
m_ex_queensorder_05_8,Hey y'all.
m_ex_queensorder_05_9,What do we have here?
m_ex_queensorder_05_10,You're sending clothes to Mister on the sly?
m_ex_queensorder_05_11,That's right.
m_ex_queensorder_05_12,Got a problem with that?
m_ex_queensorder_05_13,You bet I do.
m_ex_queensorder_05_14,"I've had my hands full lately,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_15,and haven't had time to bring Mister any decent clothes.
m_ex_queensorder_05_16,"I owe him,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_17,so I should be the one
m_ex_queensorder_05_18,to make him some proper clothes.
m_ex_queensorder_05_19,"To be precise, we all owe him."
m_ex_queensorder_05_20,"Also, I don't need a reason to do something nice for him."
m_ex_queensorder_05_21,"What do you think, Mister?"
m_ex_queensorder_05_22,Whose gift do you want?
m_ex_queensorder_05_23,Neither.
m_ex_queensorder_05_24,Both.
m_ex_queensorder_05_25,...
m_ex_queensorder_05_26,There are no new messages for a while.
m_ex_queensorder_05_27,I'm not satisfied with this outcome.
m_ex_queensorder_05_28,Me neither.
m_ex_queensorder_05_29,"We don't want you ending up empty-handed, {AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_30,"So,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_31,why don't you just take both of our gifts?
m_ex_queensorder_05_32,"It's the best outcome, really."
m_ex_queensorder_05_33,?!
m_ex_queensorder_05_34,Hmm...
m_ex_queensorder_05_35,"I never pegged you as a greedy one, Mister."
m_ex_queensorder_05_36,"Then again, it's better to be open about your desires"
m_ex_queensorder_05_37,rather than hiding them.
m_ex_queensorder_05_38,"Actually, I think this is a win for all of us."
m_ex_queensorder_05_39,I know I'm okay with it.
m_ex_queensorder_05_40,"Ok, take them all."
m_ex_queensorder_05_41,I'll bring a lot of pretty clothes over!
m_ex_queensorder_05_42,"I'll get mine ready, too."
m_ex_queensorder_05_43,"No, you don't have to..."
m_ex_queensorder_05_44,Just shut up and accept them!
m_ex_queensorder_05_45,I'll bring more if you don't.
m_ex_queensorder_05_46,"Occasionally,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_47,we like to splurge and spend a little extra
m_ex_queensorder_05_48,on our favorite commander.
m_ex_queensorder_05_49,"Just don't ever leave us,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_50,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_queensorder_05_51,The entire reason we're doing this is
m_ex_queensorder_05_52,because you didn't leave us behind.
m_ex_queensorder_05_53,Right.
m_ex_queensorder_05_54,You deserve it!
m_ex_queensorder_05_55,"So get ready,"
m_ex_queensorder_05_56,because there's plenty more where that came from.
m_ex_queensorder_05_57,If you say so.
m_ex_queensorder_05_58,??
m_ex_queensorder_05_59,Did someone say 'clothes'?
m_ex_queensorder_05_60,What about me?
m_ex_queensorder_05_61,You're too late.
m_ex_queensorder_05_62,"Too bad, slowpoke."
m_ex_queensorder_05_63,"Aw, c'mon!"
m_ex_queensorder_05_64,"I wanna buy clothes for Cadet, too!!!"
m_ex_queensorder_05_65,I can afford to buy tons!!!
m_ex_queensorder_05_66,It's your own fault for not checking your messages.
m_ex_queensorder_05_67,Slowpoke.
m_ex_queensorder_05_68,Quit calling me that!!!!
m_ex_queensorder_05_69,"Sorry, is someone talking?"
m_ex_queensorder_05_70,Loooooserrrrr
m_ex_queensorder_05_71,!#@$()X!@LKJX!
m_ex_queensorder_05_72,Cadet!!! Do something!
m_ex_queensorder_05_73,I'm officially excusing myself from this conversation.
m_ex_queensorder_05_74,!#!)LKLSJFK!)!#R%!)*
m_ex_queensorder_05_75,I better turn off notifications...
m_ex_2023_summer_01_1,Anis has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_2,Anis has invited Neon to join the group.

m_ex_2023_summer_01_7,Anis has invited Liter to join the group.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_8,That's all the invites.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_9,This group name?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_10,Why?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_11,I think it's pretty apt.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_12,What makes you think this will be a holiday?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_13,That's what I thought.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_14,"Since we're going to the sea, I doubt we'll just be working."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_15,"For sure. When I'm not working, I'll be training hard."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_16,??
m_ex_2023_summer_01_17,Don't tell me
m_ex_2023_summer_01_18,we're only gonna be working the entire time?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_19,We can't rest at all? Then why are we going to the sea?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_20,I'm still going to train hard.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_21,Waterpower
m_ex_2023_summer_01_22,By waterpower.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_23,For waterpower.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_24,"What about firepower? Traitor, lol."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_25,Have you ever heard of polyamory?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_26,I don't think that really counts in this case.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_27,"I guess you're referring to Poli's romantic relationship, aka poliamory. LOL"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_28,"Fine, then I'll just become a super hybrid."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_29,LOL
m_ex_2023_summer_01_30,"Anyway,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_31,"everyone has one thing they want to do when they get to the sea, don't they?"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_32,How about we go around and share it with everyone?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_33,Why?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_34,Because I think it will be fun!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_35,"Plus, if we talk about them, it'll increase the chances of them coming true."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_36,Good thinking.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_37,I'll go first then.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_38,I want to ride on the sea with Black Typhoon.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_39,Question:
m_ex_2023_summer_01_40,What do a Nikke and a motorcycle have in common?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_41,Neither of them floats.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_42,I can solve that easily enough.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_43,Not sure how you expect to get around gravity.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_44,Me next!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_45,I wanna reveal my aspirations.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_46,"slsl

m_ex_2023_summer_01_47,What iss that supposed to meean?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_48,Awwwooooggaah!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_49,Bleeble bleeble
m_ex_2023_summer_01_50,Waterpower! Waterpower!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_51,What's gotten into you two?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_52,Darn it!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_53,"I was trying to use letters to express viscously what waves look like,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_54,in order to properly venerate waterpower.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_55,I don't think you're using 'viscously' right there.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_56,I'm not?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_57,"Master, are you making fun of me?"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_58,That last word you said
m_ex_2023_summer_01_59,doesn't even make sense!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_60,"That's the spirit, Master!"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_61,You picked up on the fact that I was trying to use letters to
m_ex_2023_summer_01_62,visually represent waves crashing!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_63,"... Oh, is that what you were trying to do?"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_64,"... Okay, not terribly interested in this conversation, so next!"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_65,"I'm goin there tto work,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_66,"nott to play arond,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_67,unlike SOME peple.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_68,"Fine fine, go and work your butt off. Next!"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_69,"Hmm... if I'm being honest, it's the same for me too."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_70,"Since you guys might end up getting hurt during the vacation,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_71,I was thinking about setting up a basic clinic.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_72,You should live a little.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_73,Medical staff deserves some rest once in a while as well.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_74,"I'd like to, but I can't."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_75,"I'd like to, but I can't."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_76,There's this certain patient I know that's always getting himself injured.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_77,"... It's me, isn't it?"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_78,This guy sounds like a real pain.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_79,So don't get yourself hurt during this mission!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_80,Or else you won't be able to hold hands with me and walk on the beach.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_81,?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_82,?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_83,?
m_ex_2023_summer_01_84,"Oh, sorry."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_85,"Since we were talking about things we want to do,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_86,that was one that I was thinking about.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_87,"Just slipped out, hehe."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_88,LOL
m_ex_2023_summer_01_89,"All right, next up is me."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_90,"For me,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_91,"I want to open up a nice cold can of soda on the beach,"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_92,"and eat real, honest-to-goodness fried chicken, none of that Nutrium stuff."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_93,I just wanna sit back and enjoy my vacation
m_ex_2023_summer_01_94,surrounded by the people I love.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_95,"You're gonna have to catch a chicken first, though."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_96,Thaat's not all.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_97,Youll have to knnow how tto de-feather it.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_98,Lots.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_99,Of work.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_100,"I think it's a great idea, Anis."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_101,Thanks!
m_ex_2023_summer_01_102,"If you think so, that means it can't be all that bad."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_103,Just talking about this stuff makes it seem all the more real.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_104,"We're really going to the seaside, guys!"
m_ex_2023_summer_01_105,Let's be sure and have as much fun as we can while we're there.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_106,Rapi hasn't shared yet.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_107,There's nothing I want.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_108,"As long as the Commander is safe, I'll be happy."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_109,"I knew she was going to say that, so I didn't bother asking."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_110,She's like a broken record.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_111,"If you ask me, that's one of her positive traits."
m_ex_2023_summer_01_112,...
m_ex_2023_summer_01_113,Thank you.
m_ex_2023_summer_01_114,Ha! She even uses ellipses like she always does.
m_ex_2023_summer_02_1,Ahhhhhhhh
m_ex_2023_summer_02_2,Commander!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_3,Everyone!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_4,Are you guys okay over there?
m_ex_2023_summer_02_5,Yes.

m_ex_2023_summer_02_7,Just give me a sign!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_8,"One word,"
m_ex_2023_summer_02_9,that's all I ask!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_10,I know this isn't the first time
m_ex_2023_summer_02_11,"we've been separated,"
m_ex_2023_summer_02_12,"and it's not the first time communications have been unstable,"
m_ex_2023_summer_02_13,"and I'm not too worried since you're all a battle-hardened bunch,"
m_ex_2023_summer_02_14,but
m_ex_2023_summer_02_15,still.
m_ex_2023_summer_02_16,I never showed you
m_ex_2023_summer_02_17,my swimsuit.
m_ex_2023_summer_02_18,I was saving it for the right moment.
m_ex_2023_summer_02_19,How could this have happened?
m_ex_2023_summer_02_20,My vacation has been wrenched away from me!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_21,Torn away by the sea...
m_ex_2023_summer_02_22,I'd love to see you in that swimsuit as well.
m_ex_2023_summer_02_23,Maybe you could try swimming over here?

m_ex_2023_summer_02_36,"I'm having a moment here, and I'd rather you not interrupt."
m_ex_2023_summer_02_37,"With things as they are, we might as well take a ride on the bike."
m_ex_2023_summer_02_38,Are you planning on taking that thing to the sea again?
m_ex_2023_summer_02_39,Yep!
m_ex_2023_summer_02_40,"Yeah, no thanks."

m_ex_2023_summer_02_44,"The Commander is on the beach, surrounded by girls in swimsuits."
m_ex_2023_summer_02_45,Each of them with different intentions...

m_ex_2023_summer_03_1,I used to dream about summer vacation.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_2,The sky would be clear blue.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_3,The sea was emerald green.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_4,"Instead, I'm lumped together with Sugar, going full castaway."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_5,There's not a hint of sweet summer vibes anywhere.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_6,I'm sorry to hear that.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_7,I'll get back to you soon.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_8,Message failed to send.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_9,Hmm...
m_ex_2023_summer_03_10,I know that none of these texts
m_ex_2023_summer_03_11,are getting through.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_12,It feels like I'm banging my head up against a wall.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_13,At least Sugar and I are getting along pretty well.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_14,"There aren't a lot of Raptures around,"
m_ex_2023_summer_03_15,"and whenever Sugar is bored,"
m_ex_2023_summer_03_16,she takes her bike for a spin
m_ex_2023_summer_03_17,and wipes out the few Raptures we do come across.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_18,That's right.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_19,I suppose things aren't ALL bad.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_20,Glad to hear that.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_21,Message failed to send.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_22,"That doesn't mean I don't miss you, Commander!"
m_ex_2023_summer_03_23,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_2023_summer_03_24,you're a human being!
m_ex_2023_summer_03_25,"You could float your way over here, or try swimming."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_26,Or...
m_ex_2023_summer_03_27,Maybe you could build a raft and row over?
m_ex_2023_summer_03_28,Liter already made blueprints for a boat.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_29,Message failed to send.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_30,Liter is there too.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_31,Ask her if she can make
m_ex_2023_summer_03_32,an amphibious motorcycle.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_33,"Yeah, something like an amphibious."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_34,"Wait, no! Not that."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_35,Ugh.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_36,Why do I even bother? It's not like any of these messages are going through.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_37,"Oof, this is getting depressing."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_38,"Here I am on vacation, and I can't even have fun."
m_ex_2023_summer_03_39,Sure you can.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_40,I've got a swimsuit that I can't even put on.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_41,Put it on.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_42,I haven't got a single person to hang out with and have fun.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_43,What about me?
m_ex_2023_summer_03_44,You don't count.
m_ex_2023_summer_03_45,T_T

m_ex_2023_summer_04_1,Anis
m_ex_2023_summer_04_2,"I don't know if you realize this,"
m_ex_2023_summer_04_3,but your texts have been coming through this entire time.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_4,Huh?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_5,What?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_6,You really do enjoy talking to yourself...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_7,??
m_ex_2023_summer_04_8,I did no such thing!
m_ex_2023_summer_04_9,03:01 Anis: I used to dream about summer vacation.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_10,03:01 Anis: The sky would be clear blue.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_11,03:01 Anis: The sea was emerald green.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_12,"03:02 Anis: Instead, I'm lumped together with Sugar, going full castaway."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_13,Wait
m_ex_2023_summer_04_14,Why are those still there?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_15,I thought I recalled all those!
m_ex_2023_summer_04_16,I dunno.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_17,Maybe you only deleted them on your end?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_18,?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_19,What's the difference?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_20,I think I see what's going on here.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_21,"If you recall the text, the record itself is fully erased,"
m_ex_2023_summer_04_22,"whereas deleting it merely takes it off your phone, not everyone else's."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_23,"Oooh, I gotcha."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_24,Hehe
m_ex_2023_summer_04_25,Hehe
m_ex_2023_summer_04_26,Hey! Have all of you been synchronized? Stop laughing at me!
m_ex_2023_summer_04_27,10:55 Anis: None of my messages are getting through.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_28,10:55 Anis: It's starting to feel like I'm talking to myself.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_29,Haha.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_30,"We were getting all of your messages, every last one."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_31,"You have no idea how bad I felt for you, Anis."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_32,And the Commander was replying to every text as well.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_33,He was?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_34,I honestly thought none of them were going through...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_35,"Okay, then."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_36,Care to elaborate on this little exchange?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_37,10:57 Anis: I can see it now.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_38,"10:57 Anis: The Commander is on the beach, surrounded by girls in swimsuits."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_39,10:57 Anis: Each of them with different intentions...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_40,10:57 Anis: Argh!
m_ex_2023_summer_04_41,What exactly did you mean by 'different intentions'?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_42,Different what?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_43,Are you saying there may be other spies in our midst besides me?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_44,True. It would stand to reason that Neon wouldn't be the only spy in a team this large.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_45,I'm not sure myself.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_46,"Uh-oh,"
m_ex_2023_summer_04_47,so I'm not alone!
m_ex_2023_summer_04_48,"Can the other spy, please raise your hand?"
m_ex_2023_summer_04_49,Actually...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_50,I don't really know.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_51,What? But you were the one who said it in the first place.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_52,No one replies.
m_ex_2023_summer_04_53,Anyone?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_54,Why'd everyone go quiet all of a sudden?
m_ex_2023_summer_04_55,"Usually, the culprit is the one who gets tight-lipped."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_56,"Wait, are you saying everyone here is...?!"
m_ex_2023_summer_04_57,Hmm...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_58,Unless...
m_ex_2023_summer_04_59,"Everyone who's innocent, type out a '1'."
m_ex_2023_summer_04_60,1
m_ex_2023_summer_04_61,11?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_1,"Hello, Commander."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_2,How's it been returning to daily life?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_3,Why did you create a new chat for this?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_4,Because I wanted to talk in secret.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_5,???
m_ex_2023_summer_05_6,"You and I are accomplices, remember?"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_7,"Here, we can talk about what can't be seen by others."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_8,"Then, once we're done, we can delete it."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_9,What did you want to talk about?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_10,I just thought
m_ex_2023_summer_05_11,you'd be curious as to
m_ex_2023_summer_05_12,what happened after Pepper and I got back
m_ex_2023_summer_05_13,to the Repair Center.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_14,"Ah, yes! I've been waiting for an update."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_15,"Well,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_16,the long and short of it is...
m_ex_2023_summer_05_17,nothing really happened.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_18,"So much so, that I'm starting to wonder if I was making a mountain out of a molehill."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_19,"Actually,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_20,"come to think of it, there was one thing..."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_21,What was it?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_22,A surprise party.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_23,"Pepper wanted to celebrate the anniversary of my coming to work at the Repair Center,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_24,so she and the patients prepared a little shindig for me.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_25,They really shouldn't have.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_26,"It's a cause for celebration, so why not?"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_27,That definitely sounds like Pepper.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_28,I guess so. I don't really see it myself.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_29,"I'm thankful that she's thinking about me, but still..."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_30,"I was thinking the same thing, hehe."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_31,"However,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_32,"after going through that party,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_33,I felt a bit weird.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_34,I was convinced that
m_ex_2023_summer_05_35,"if I returned to the Repair Center,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_36,"disaster would be imminent,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_37,but it seems like nothing has changed.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_38,I feel like a higher power has given me another chance.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_39,You think so?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_40,Yes.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_41,A chance to continue my atonement.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_42,"Of course, this doesn't erase my past,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_43,and I fully realize this new-found state of grace is only temporary.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_44,"If there's anything I could point towards being different than before,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_45,I guess I'd have to say that I don't feel the same temptation that I used to.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_46,You've become stronger.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_47,That's the Mary I know and love.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_48,Hehe!
m_ex_2023_summer_05_49,I think I wanted to hear that from you directly.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_50,Perhaps that's why I told you this story.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_51,"Thank you, Commander,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_52,for being so supportive.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_53,"You've always been there for me, and kept me from doubting myself."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_54,Don't mention it.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_55,You should thank yourself. You're the one who did this.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_56,I never take for granted how lucky I am.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_57,"No, that's not true."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_58,"If it weren't for you, I would have never gotten through this."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_59,So please don't shortchange yourself.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_60,"Oh, right. If it's not too much trouble,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_61,could you pass on a message to Neon for me?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_62,What should I say?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_63,Can you tell her that
m_ex_2023_summer_05_64,I've threaded the shells like she suggested and hung them from the windows for decoration.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_65,All the patients love them.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_66,"And also,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_67,"tell her I'll give her three free health check-ups,"
m_ex_2023_summer_05_68,so she has to be sure to show up for them!
m_ex_2023_summer_05_69,I'm not so sure she'll be a fan of that 'reward'.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_70,You don't think so?
m_ex_2023_summer_05_71,I was going to give you the same gift.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_72,"As you can see, I'm as healthy as a horse."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_73,There's no way to  know for sure
m_ex_2023_summer_05_74,just looking at the outside.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_75,Especially for someone like you who is always on the front lines.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_76,"Um... sorry, I've got a meeting coming up."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_77,"Um... sorry, Anis just came to the Commander's Room."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_78,"No problem, I'll just leave the reservation link here."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_79,"Once you've made your reservation, just leave a message."
m_ex_2023_summer_05_80,arc.com/healthcare/input_examinee_info
m_ex_2023_summer_05_81,I'll dismantle this room now
m_ex_2023_summer_05_82,and head back to my personal bla.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_83,Okay.
m_ex_2023_summer_05_84,Mary left the group chat.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_1,Hmmm
m_ex_2023_summer_06_2,"Yan isn't in this room yet, is she?"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_3,Neon has invited Yan to join the group.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_4,Welcome to the Working Holiday group chat.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_5,Huh?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_6,I had no idea a room like this existed.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_7,Isn't our mission already over?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_8,Why are you inviting me in here?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_9,Because there's definitely gonna be at least
m_ex_2023_summer_06_10,one
m_ex_2023_summer_06_11,more
m_ex_2023_summer_06_12,vacation.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_13,I've already spoken with my superior.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_14,Oh?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_15,What did they say?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_16,"C'mon, teeelllll mmeeeee!"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_17,"If any mission comes up, he'll send us."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_18,There won't be any further missions.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_19,What? How come?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_20,You mean Andersen said no?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_21,Does he have a personal grudge against me or something?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_22,What'd I ever do to this guy?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_23,I never did anything!
m_ex_2023_summer_06_24,"I was just joking, hehe."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_25,So does that mean...
m_ex_2023_summer_06_26,We've got approval. We can go back to the island.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_27,Yahoo!
m_ex_2023_summer_06_28,I wanna go too!
m_ex_2023_summer_06_29,I think it goes without saying that I'd love to tag along as well.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_30,I never thought another opportunity would come this quickly.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_31,"You're the best, Commander."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_32,"You'll keep your promise,"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_33,won't you?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_34,Of course.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_35,"You're always full of surprises, hehe."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_36,"I know I keep saying it,"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_37,but thank you.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_38,... What's going on between you two?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_39,You both seem awfully chummy all of a sudden.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_40,"Sorry, it's a secret, hehe!"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_41,Bah!
m_ex_2023_summer_06_42,I knew there was a reason I felt uneasy being separated from everyone else.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_43,"If you insist on talking about this, the three of you can create your own chat group."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_44,"Anyway, if you're going, take me too."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_45,"Now that Talentum has partial access to the resource distribution rights,"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_46,this last excursion is paying off handsomely.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_47,What lobbying strategies did you use to
m_ex_2023_summer_06_48,"get approval so quickly, Rookie?"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_49,All I did was mention your performance in my report.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_50,No kidding?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_51,So that's why they have been putting the focus on grain lately.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_52,I've received several new contract offers from the Wildlife Agency.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_53,"We're gonna be raking in the dough, and it's all thanks to you."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_54,It was a nice give and take.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_55,I also benefitted from this. I got to see you in a swimsuit.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_56,I assume you're referring to my swimsuits?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_57,I'm glad you enjoyed them. We put a lot of effort into them.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_58,"Oh, believe me, I know I looked good in it."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_59,Talentum spared no expense in crafting the finest swimsuit we could.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_60,"So,"
m_ex_2023_summer_06_61,when are we setting out?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_62,Still to be determined at this point.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_63,Er...
m_ex_2023_summer_06_64,Can you at least give us a rough estimate?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_65,At least give me something to cling to while I wait.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_66,If I had to guess... maybe two months?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_67,Two months?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_68,That's sooner than I thought.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_69,Sooner?! Are you kidding? That's like forever away.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_70,"I'll be working at the center, so time will fly by for me."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_71,Will you and I have an opportunity to see each other before we head out?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_72,Sure.
m_ex_2023_summer_06_73,Wait... do you mean for a checkup?
m_ex_2023_summer_06_74,"Yep, hehe."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_75,...
m_ex_2023_summer_06_76,Gahhh!
m_ex_2023_summer_06_77,:'(
m_ex_2023_summer_06_78,"Oh stop, it's not that bad."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_79,"You won't have to wait in line for very long, so it'll all be over fast."
m_ex_2023_summer_06_80,No one replies.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_1,"Hi, Commander."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_2,Are you enjoying your summer?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_3,Did you change your profile picture?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_4,Hehe
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_5,You noticed!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_6,Pepper wanted me to change it.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_7,She said it'd be a nice change of pace.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_8,What do you think?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_9,Does it give off summer vibes?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_10,Absolutely. Cool and refreshing summer.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_11,Absolutely. Hot and sultry summer.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_12,My thoughts exactly!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_13,Wearing a swimsuit
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_14,keeps you nice and cool.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_15,I wouldn't know.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_16,Ha! I suppose not.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_17,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_18,You think so?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_19,That certainly wasn't the reaction I expected.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_20,"Having said that,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_21,knowing that I can inspire
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_22,such a reaction in you
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_23,"makes me pretty happy, hehe!"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_24,I was worried
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_25,you wouldn't be a fan.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_26,I'm glad
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_27,you're into it.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_28,I would have liked it no matter what kind of swimsuit you were wearing.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_29,Wow!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_30,That's so nice of you to say!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_31,"In that case,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_32,I'll have to try on some different looks in the future.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_33,For example?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_34,"Sorry,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_35,but I'll have to keep the details a secret.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_36,You'll just have to wait and see.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_37,"For the time being, would you like to come to see me"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_38,so you can appreciate this swimsuit in person?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_39,Are you asking me to go for a swim?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_40,"That'd be nice too, but"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_41,I was thinking more along the lines of a traditional date.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_42,"Oh, and I can also give you your summer physical!"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_43,Er... I don't know about that...
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_44,You don't want to come to see me?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_45,Don't tell me
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_46,this swimsuit has already lost its allure?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_47,... I'll be right over.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_48,Okay
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_01_49,I will be waiting!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_1,Whoooosh
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_2,?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_3,Whoooosh
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_4,Mary?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_5,"Hehe,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_6,can you guess what that sound is?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_7,What are you doing?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_8,"The weather tonight is so lovely,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_9,"so I thought it'd be nice to remember the waves,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_10,and I wanted you to remember them too.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_11,"With that being said,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_12,do you prefer a sunny beach
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_13,"in the middle of the day,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_14,or a nighttime beach
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_15,with a sky full of stars?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_16,I prefer a sunny daytime beach.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_17,I prefer the beach at night.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_18,I knew it.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_19,"Whenever I see the sunlight reflecting off the water's surface,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_20,I feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_21,"It's the same feeling I get when I'm around you, Commander."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_22,I'm so glad you like this kind of scenery as well!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_23,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_24,You too?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_25,I've always associated with you more
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_26,"with bright daytime and warm temperatures,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_27,"so I thought that's what you'd prefer,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_28,but I guess I was mistaken.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_29,"What about you, Mary?"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_30,Hmmm
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_31,"If I had to choose, I like the sea better at night, but"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_32,just getting to glimpse the sea in the first place
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_33,was an unforgettable experience in itself.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_34,"In the Ark,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_35,you never get to see anything
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_36,remotely like the ocean.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_37,Right.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_38,"You never get to see a night sky full of stars, either."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_39,"The starlight reflected off the ocean's surface,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_40,shimmering and coalescing together as one.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_41,I'll never forget that image
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_42,for as long as I live.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_43,Neither will I.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_44,LOL
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_45,I'm so lucky
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_46,to have met you.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_47,"With that being said,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_48,"you've got to stay healthy for a long time,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_49,Commander.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_50,"That way, you'll be able to keep seeing those wonderful ocean views."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_51,"Same to you, Mary."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_52,LOL
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_02_53,"I'll try my best, hehe!"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_1,Hmm...
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_2,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_3,"this is a fairly personal question, but..."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_4,What is it?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_5,Would you prefer
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_6,me wearing something
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_7,"over top of my swimsuit,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_8,or would it be better if I just let it all hang out?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_9,I like it if you cover up a bit more.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_10,I like it when it's all out in the open.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_11,Hmm... I see.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_12,So what about this swimsuit I have on now?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_13,Do you like it?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_14,I... think so?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_15,It's a bit off.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_16,Good!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_17,"If you like the one I've already got on,"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_18,then I don't have to think about it too much.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_19,Oh no! So you'd prefer something a little different?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_20,Picking the right swimwear is tougher than I thought.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_21,I'll have to do a little more research next time.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_22,Oh my!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_23,So you like swimsuits that are a bit more bold?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_24,Hmm...
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_25,So the one I'm wearing right now
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_26,"probably isn't to your liking, I assume?"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_27,"To be honest, no."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_28,Not necessarily. I'm into it.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_29,Ha!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_30,I appreciate your honesty.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_31,I'll make a mental note.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_32,"Oh, so this is also in line with your preferences?"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_33,"Your taste has a rather wide range, Commander."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_34,Hehe!
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_35,"In that case, I won't worry myself too much about what I'm wearing."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_36,Why are you asking me all of this?
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_37,Just curious.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_38,Lots of ladies want to catch the eye of
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_39,the man they're interested in.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_40,"Mary, you look gorgeous no matter what you wear."
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_41,LOL
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_42,"Thank you, Commander!"
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_43,I'll contact you again
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_44,when I want to get your thoughts on my wardrobe.
m_ex_mary_baygoddess_03_45,Please do.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_1,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_2,I feel weird.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_3,Just out of the blue?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_4,How do I put this...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_5,It feels like my body is empty.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_6,I see.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_7,"Do you think I'm just imagining this, or what?"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_8,"Maybe, but you're cuter than ever, so what's the problem?"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_9,"I've been turning it around in my head again and again,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_10,but I can't get over it. It just doesn't sit right with me.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_11,Being cute
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_12,is like being small.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_13,Right?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_14,"But I'm not small,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_15,I'm big!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_16,"Waterpower isn't small and adorable, it's big and bold!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_17,I see.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_18,"After mastering the way of waterpower,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_19,I should be bigger than ever!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_20,I see.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_21,??
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_22,"Master,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_23,"do you have anything else to say other than,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_24,'I see'?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_25,Sure I do.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_26,"Finally, a new line!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_27,Yep.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_28,...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_29,What were we talking about again?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_30,You were saying you felt empty.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_31,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_32,That was it!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_33,Hmm...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_34,How do I overcome this feeling of emptiness?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_35,Do you think going in the water would help?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_36,!!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_37,"I mean, if you're wearing a swimsuit, it only makes sense to take a dip."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_38,I get it now!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_39,You're saying I have to fill these empty clothes with water!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_40,"Master, you never disappoint."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_41,"I will always be your faithful disciple,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_42,"not just when it comes to firepower,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_43,but to waterpower as well.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_44,You don't have to do that...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_45,You can always think of me as your master.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_46,What do you mean?!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_47,"Once a master, always a master!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_48,"Yes, Master!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_49,"All right then,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_50,I'll see you soon whenever I've got any new conundrums.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_01_51,"Waterpower, waterpower!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_1,Maaaaasssster!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_2,Let's go do some waterpower training!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_3,"Sorry, I'm a little busy right now."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_4,Training can also be done with your heart.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_5,What?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_6,"I can envision you right now,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_7,laying in bed as you type these messages.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_8,That's just your mind playing tricks on you.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_9,Huh?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_10,But I'm always training from the bottom of my heart
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_11,when it comes to waterpower.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_12,Then try and fill your heart even more with waterpower.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_13,Fine.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_14,"If you really don't want to come out,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_15,I'll come to kidnap...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_16,"Invite you, I mean."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_17,How about some solo training for today?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_18,"Just me, alone?"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_19,Hmm...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_20,"If I train alone,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_21,I feel like I'm only operating at like 1%.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_22,Aren't you exaggerating just a little bit?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_23,No way!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_24,"That's how much you mean to me, Master!"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_25,You don't say.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_26,I do say!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_27,"Fine, then how about we do some remote training today?"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_28,Remote training?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_29,Yep.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_30,...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_31,Why is it that I get the feeling
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_32,you're only proposing this so that you can stay in bed?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_33,"I must admit, it does sound intriguing though."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_34,"Okay, let's give it a try."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_35,Thank you.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_36,Don't mention it.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_37,What do you see nearby?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_38,Let me check...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_39,I see water.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_40,Dip your toe in it.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_41,Done!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_42,How does that feel?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_43,Cool.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_44,"Now, close your eyes so that you can remember that feeling."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_45,Right now?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_46,Yes.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_47,Huh?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_48,But then I won't be able to send you any messages.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_49,"It's okay, since this training is all about filling your heart."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_50,??
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_51,We'll be together in our hearts.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_52,"Oh,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_53,I get it now!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_54,"Okay,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_55,we can be together in our hearts.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_56,I'm closing my eyes now.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_57,Have fun training.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_02_58,I will!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_1,Master!!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_2,I'm using my phone
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_3,to increase my waterpower.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_4,Do you want to join?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_5,Did you just say with your phone?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_6,Yep!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_7,I'm training with my phone.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_8,"You didn't go into the water with it, did you?"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_9,Of course!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_10,"If I want to increase my waterpower,"
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_11,I've got to get in the water.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_12,Can you still see your screen?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_13,Crystal clear.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_14,I can see
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_15,all your messages perfectly.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_16,How long has it been since you started training?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_17,Let me think...
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_18,How long has it been?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_19,30 minutes? Or was it only 5 minutes?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_20,There's a big difference between those two.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_21,Hehehehe
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_22,"To be honest, I'm not sure how long it's been."
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_23,LOL
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_24,Hehe!
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_25,I'm amazing you've been at it this long.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_26,Really?
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_27,That's
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_28,because
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_29,I'm the
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_30,water god's

m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_37,I don't think it can handle all the 'waterpower'.

m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_46,There are no more messages.
m_ex_neon_blueocean_03_47,I don't think I'll be getting any messages from Neon for a while.
m_ex_nero_01_1,"This is Scoops' number,"
m_ex_nero_01_2,right?
m_ex_nero_01_3,Who is this?
m_ex_nero_01_4,Meow?
m_ex_nero_01_5,This is Nero from the Happy Zoo Squad.
m_ex_nero_01_6,I'm responsible for looking after the cats at the animal shelter.
m_ex_nero_01_7,You've apparently been chosen to work with me.
m_ex_nero_01_8,Why me?
m_ex_nero_01_9,I overheard Biscuit saying
m_ex_nero_01_10,"that you get along well with dogs, and give them plenty of treats."
m_ex_nero_01_11,"So, I think you and I will be a good fit."
m_ex_nero_01_12,"There might be a learning curve, since this will be your first time taking care of a cat,"
m_ex_nero_01_13,"but if you put the work in, I promise you'll find it rewarding."
m_ex_nero_01_14,This is all a bit sudden...
m_ex_nero_01_15,I've actually been looking forward to an opportunity like this.
m_ex_nero_01_16,"It's natural to feel that way when you're doing something new,"
m_ex_nero_01_17,"but once you get attached to a cat,"
m_ex_nero_01_18,you won't be able to imagine your life without them.
m_ex_nero_01_19,That'd be great if it ends up that way.
m_ex_nero_01_20,Yeah.
m_ex_nero_01_21,Is that a fact?
m_ex_nero_01_22,"Typically, a cat is the one who's more proactive in finding someone to take care of them."
m_ex_nero_01_23,:3
m_ex_nero_01_24,What kind of emoji is that?
m_ex_nero_01_25,Someone I know uses it often.
m_ex_nero_01_26,"I can't really explain why, but it makes me feel good."
m_ex_nero_01_27,Meow.
m_ex_nero_01_28,I'm starting to get sleepy.
m_ex_nero_01_29,"I'm nocturnal, so I'm having a tough time staying up at this hour."
m_ex_nero_01_30,"However, since this is the first time I've texted you,"
m_ex_nero_01_31,I'm doing everything in my power to keep my eyes opeeeee
m_ex_nero_01_32,Are you asleep right now?
m_ex_nero_01_33,eee
m_ex_nero_01_34,Sorry.
m_ex_nero_01_35,I dozed off for a moment.
m_ex_nero_01_36,"Anyway, come visit the shelter soon."
m_ex_nero_01_37,"If you bring some treats, or a new toy,"
m_ex_nero_01_38,that might grease the wheels and help us get along more quickly.
m_ex_nero_01_39,"Okay, I'll do my best."
m_ex_nero_01_40,There's no response. Nero must be asleep.
m_ex_nero_02_1,Scoops
m_ex_nero_02_2,I have a favor to ask of you.
m_ex_nero_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_nero_02_4,"During snack time for the cats at the shelter today,"
m_ex_nero_02_5,the tuna-flavored treats I put in storage have vanished.
m_ex_nero_02_6,"I've got to replenish them,"
m_ex_nero_02_7,but I'm too lazy.
m_ex_nero_02_8,And where do I come into the picture?
m_ex_nero_02_9,Could you refill the kitty treats for me?
m_ex_nero_02_10,It's simpurr.
m_ex_nero_02_11,Just look it up on the Talentum Mall homepage.
m_ex_nero_02_12,"They should be the third result when you search for ""tuna-flavored""."
m_ex_nero_02_13,The delivery robot will take care of the rest.
m_ex_nero_02_14,Why can't you do that yourself?
m_ex_nero_02_15,Sounds simple enough.
m_ex_nero_02_16,I can't.
m_ex_nero_02_17,"You don't understand. Once a cat is determined to be lazy,"
m_ex_nero_02_18,"nothing will shake them out of that torpor, even if it's a matter of life and death."
m_ex_nero_02_19,"To be honest, it's taking all my willpower to force myself"
m_ex_nero_02_20,to send you these messages.
m_ex_nero_02_21,It is.
m_ex_nero_02_22,Super simple. Nice and easy.
m_ex_nero_02_23,That's why I'm asking for your help.
m_ex_nero_02_24,"Okay, I'll do it."
m_ex_nero_02_25,Meowcellent!
m_ex_nero_02_26,Thanks.
m_ex_nero_02_27,Now I'm free to lie down and relax.
m_ex_nero_02_28,"To show you my gratitude,"
m_ex_nero_02_29,you can have one free pass to pet me.
m_ex_nero_02_30,Just one?
m_ex_nero_02_31,What an honor.
m_ex_nero_02_32,You should consider yourself lucky.
m_ex_nero_02_33,I usually prefer seeking you out.
m_ex_nero_02_34,"If it's the other way around, I can get a bit irritable."
m_ex_nero_02_35,"With this pass, I'm giving you the right to come find me first."
m_ex_nero_02_36,Do you realize how big of a deal that is?
m_ex_nero_02_37,What an honor.
m_ex_nero_02_38,Meow
m_ex_nero_02_39,I'll leave you to it then.
m_ex_nero_02_40,You can send the bill to the shelter.
m_ex_nero_02_41,"The address for the shelter will come up if you search for it,"
m_ex_nero_02_42,so there's no need for me to send it to you.
m_ex_nero_02_43,There's a nice cardboard box I've got my eye on.
m_ex_nero_02_44,I'm gonna curl up inside that and have a nice cat nap.
m_ex_nero_02_45,Inside a box?
m_ex_nero_02_46,It was one of the boxes from a previous delivery.
m_ex_nero_02_47,"I like the snug feeling I get when I squeeze myself inside of it,"
m_ex_nero_02_48,so I often use it as a place to sleep.
m_ex_nero_02_49,Is that why you use the shop rated third instead of the first?
m_ex_nero_02_50,Precisely.
m_ex_nero_02_51,The box is just as important as the treats themselves.
m_ex_nero_02_52,"Anyway, I really should get going."
m_ex_nero_02_53,Have a nice rest.
m_ex_nero_02_54,I'll have to find a chance to use Nero's petting pass at some point.
m_ex_nero_03_1,Scoops
m_ex_nero_03_2,I have something to tell you.
m_ex_nero_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_nero_03_4,"When I stopped by the Commander's Room a while ago,"
m_ex_nero_03_5,you had all sorts of bits and bobs
m_ex_nero_03_6,hanging precariously
m_ex_nero_03_7,at the edge of your desk:
m_ex_nero_03_8,"a coffee cup, a plate, a desk lamp, and more."
m_ex_nero_03_9,It was making me antsy just looking at all of it.
m_ex_nero_03_10,So??
m_ex_nero_03_11,I balanced it out.
m_ex_nero_03_12,?
m_ex_nero_03_13,?
m_ex_nero_03_14,What does that mean?
m_ex_nero_03_15,I used my paws to rearrange a few things
m_ex_nero_03_16,and bring a sense of balance back to your desk.
m_ex_nero_03_17,"The plate and desk lamp were all okay,"
m_ex_nero_03_18,but the coffee cup shattered.
m_ex_nero_03_19,"It made a real racket,"
m_ex_nero_03_20,"and gave me quite a fright, so I hurried out of there."
m_ex_nero_03_21,"By the time I fled all the way back to the shelter,"
m_ex_nero_03_22,I figured the right thing to do
m_ex_nero_03_23,would be to let you know.
m_ex_nero_03_24,"So the short version is, you broke my coffee cup."
m_ex_nero_03_25,No.
m_ex_nero_03_26,I merely attempted to restore balance to your workspace.
m_ex_nero_03_27,The cup broke itself.
m_ex_nero_03_28,...
m_ex_nero_03_29,Meow...
m_ex_nero_03_30,Fine.
m_ex_nero_03_31,I broke it.
m_ex_nero_03_32,Do you want me to come back and put everything back where it was?
m_ex_nero_03_33,"No, I'll take care of it."
m_ex_nero_03_34,!!
m_ex_nero_03_35,"Okay, great."
m_ex_nero_03_36,But promise me one thing.
m_ex_nero_03_37,What's that?
m_ex_nero_03_38,"From now on, no matter how uncomfortable my desk arrangement makes you feel, leave it alone."
m_ex_nero_03_39,But...
m_ex_nero_03_40,I'd have to deny my feline instincts.
m_ex_nero_03_41,It's like when humans clean their rooms when they get too dirty.
m_ex_nero_03_42,It's something you just do naturally.
m_ex_nero_03_43,What you've done is the opposite of cleaning.
m_ex_nero_03_44,Why would you think that?
m_ex_nero_03_45,"After your ""re-balancing"" act, I've got to clean up the broken bits and stuff."
m_ex_nero_03_46,Nero doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_nero_03_47,...
m_ex_nero_03_48,I...
m_ex_nero_03_49,I'm...
m_ex_nero_03_50,Yes?
m_ex_nero_03_51,I'm sorry.
m_ex_nero_03_52,From the bottom of my heart.
m_ex_nero_03_53,For making you clean up my mess.
m_ex_nero_03_54,I'll try to exercise more restraint in the future.
m_ex_nero_03_55,Apology accepted.
m_ex_nero_03_56,!!
m_ex_nero_03_57,Do I get a treat?
m_ex_nero_03_58,I'll think about it.
m_ex_nero_03_59,Sure. I'll give you some the next time you're here.
m_ex_nero_03_60,I should buy a reserve of kitty treats for the Commander's Room when I have time.
m_ex_mast_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_mast_01_2,I am a member of the Aegis Squad.
m_ex_mast_01_3,"No, no."
m_ex_mast_01_4,Such a formal greeting is unbecoming as a pirate.
m_ex_mast_01_5,Let me try again.
m_ex_mast_01_6,"I'm the Captain's helmsman, Mast."
m_ex_mast_01_7,Helmsman?
m_ex_mast_01_8,Captain?
m_ex_mast_01_9,"You know, when the captain leads the boat,"
m_ex_mast_01_10,"and says ""Turn the starboard""!"
m_ex_mast_01_11,"And helmsmen respond with ""Aye aye, Captain!"""
m_ex_mast_01_12,"If you want a capable sailor with some decent sea legs,"
m_ex_mast_01_13,I'm the one you're looking for.
m_ex_mast_01_14,My name is gonna be etched in the annals of swashbuckling legend.
m_ex_mast_01_15,It's only proper that
m_ex_mast_01_16,I'd call my super 'captain'.
m_ex_mast_01_17,Hahaha.
m_ex_mast_01_18,"You're part of the navy, but you've got an affinity for pirates?"
m_ex_mast_01_19,Of course.
m_ex_mast_01_20,Being a pirate was my original aspiration.
m_ex_mast_01_21,That's why I joined the Aegis Squad.
m_ex_mast_01_22,No kidding...
m_ex_mast_01_23,I can see why you're confused.
m_ex_mast_01_24,Most people tend to see pirates and the navy
m_ex_mast_01_25,as opposing forces.
m_ex_mast_01_26,"But in actuality, they're the same when it comes to sailing the high seas."
m_ex_mast_01_27,They both also forge a strong sense of camaraderie amongst their crews.
m_ex_mast_01_28,So I'm perfectly willing to assume the Navy moniker.
m_ex_mast_01_29,"In this day and age, having the opportunity to commandeer such an incredible vessel"
m_ex_mast_01_30,and have all sorts of adventures is good enough for me.
m_ex_mast_01_31,Aren't you a bit naïve?
m_ex_mast_01_32,Sounds epic.
m_ex_mast_01_33,Maybe a bit.
m_ex_mast_01_34,The surface is a dangerous place. It's not like the movies.
m_ex_mast_01_35,"And, the path to the sea is fraught with Raptures."
m_ex_mast_01_36,"But,"
m_ex_mast_01_37,a truly rousing sea voyage wouldn't be the same
m_ex_mast_01_38,if the wind is always at your back.
m_ex_mast_01_39,Totally!
m_ex_mast_01_40,I knew you and I would have things in common.
m_ex_mast_01_41,"The surface is a dangerous place. It's not like the movies,"
m_ex_mast_01_42,and the path to the sea is fraught with Raptures.
m_ex_mast_01_43,"But,"
m_ex_mast_01_44,I see those obstacles as integral
m_ex_mast_01_45,to providing a sense of true swashbuckling adventure.
m_ex_mast_01_46,"So, Captain,"
m_ex_mast_01_47,"no matter what stands in our way,"
m_ex_mast_01_48,we'll overcome it together!
m_ex_mast_01_49,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_mast_01_50,"Aye aye, Captain!"
m_ex_mast_02_1,"Captain,"
m_ex_mast_02_2,are you a fan of pirate films?
m_ex_mast_02_3,Not particularly.
m_ex_mast_02_4,"Whenever a new one comes out, I'm the first in the theater."
m_ex_mast_02_5,You're kidding!
m_ex_mast_02_6,I...
m_ex_mast_02_7,am so jealous!
m_ex_mast_02_8,??
m_ex_mast_02_9,What you're telling me is that
m_ex_mast_02_10,you're lucky enough to get to see the great watershed pirate films
m_ex_mast_02_11,for the first time.
m_ex_mast_02_12,Er... I suppose so.
m_ex_mast_02_13,So does that mean
m_ex_mast_02_14,you've never seen Golden Pirates?
m_ex_mast_02_15,Nope.
m_ex_mast_02_16,Perfect.
m_ex_mast_02_17,Wow!
m_ex_mast_02_18,This is wild.
m_ex_mast_02_19,It almost doesn't make sense.
m_ex_mast_02_20,How can two people have so much in common?
m_ex_mast_02_21,It is pretty interesting.
m_ex_mast_02_22,Have you seen Golden Pirates?
m_ex_mast_02_23,Isn't that an old movie?
m_ex_mast_02_24,I prefer to say classic.
m_ex_mast_02_25,"I've watched it more times than I can count,"
m_ex_mast_02_26,"but with every single viewing,"
m_ex_mast_02_27,I'm just as emotionally affected as I was the first time.
m_ex_mast_02_28,"On that note,"
m_ex_mast_02_29,I heard that they're gonna be remastering
m_ex_mast_02_30,Golden Pirates in high-definition.
m_ex_mast_02_31,Helm says she has plans and can't join me.
m_ex_mast_02_32,Anchor isn't interested because
m_ex_mast_02_33,she doesn't want to re-watch something she's already seen before.
m_ex_mast_02_34,"This movie is a masterpiece, and means so much to me,"
m_ex_mast_02_35,but I can't seem to get anyone to join me.
m_ex_mast_02_36,Hmm...
m_ex_mast_02_37,So...
m_ex_mast_02_38,if there any chance you'd be willing to see it with me?
m_ex_mast_02_39,I've got a bit of work to do at the moment...
m_ex_mast_02_40,...
m_ex_mast_02_41,"Oh, okay..."
m_ex_mast_02_42,But I'll be able to go with you sometime next week.
m_ex_mast_02_43,Woohoo!
m_ex_mast_02_44,That'd be great!
m_ex_mast_02_45,I'll get us two tickets then.
m_ex_mast_02_46,"Have some tissues handy when the time comes, 'cause you're gonna get emotional."
m_ex_mast_02_47,Will do.
m_ex_mast_02_48,Hehe!
m_ex_mast_02_49,"Anyway, I better get going. Helm's calling me."
m_ex_mast_02_50,Hope you have an adventurous day!
m_ex_mast_03_1,"Captain,"
m_ex_mast_03_2,listen to this.
m_ex_mast_03_3,It's about my parrot.
m_ex_mast_03_4,Morgan?
m_ex_mast_03_5,Yeah.
m_ex_mast_03_6,"Once you get to know him,"
m_ex_mast_03_7,"he's incredibly smart and insightful,"
m_ex_mast_03_8,but a lot of people never get to see that side of him.
m_ex_mast_03_9,"They think he's a bit dense,"
m_ex_mast_03_10,and make fun of him for it.
m_ex_mast_03_11,Isn't that mean?
m_ex_mast_03_12,What do you think I should do
m_ex_mast_03_13,so that more people can see Morgan's true colors?
m_ex_mast_03_14,Get him to do a trick in front of people.
m_ex_mast_03_15,"To be honest, I didn't realize Morgan was terribly intelligent either."
m_ex_mast_03_16,Hmm...
m_ex_mast_03_17,That might be tough.
m_ex_mast_03_18,One time I tried to teach him Bang Bang.
m_ex_mast_03_19,Never heard of that one.
m_ex_mast_03_20,"You know, when you pretend to shoot someone"
m_ex_mast_03_21,and they play dead.
m_ex_mast_03_22,"Anyway, I tried it on him, but then he went ahead and said,"
m_ex_mast_03_23,"Bang, Bang! and glared at me."
m_ex_mast_03_24,"In the end, I was the one who played dead for him."
m_ex_mast_03_25,He's quite something.
m_ex_mast_03_26,That's what I'm saying!
m_ex_mast_03_27,Something else crazy happened the other day too.
m_ex_mast_03_28,...
m_ex_mast_03_29,"I mean, I'll concede that"
m_ex_mast_03_30,he doesn't look like the sharpest tool in the shed.
m_ex_mast_03_31,But what if it's all a ruse?
m_ex_mast_03_32,How smart is he?
m_ex_mast_03_33,I can't explain it!
m_ex_mast_03_34,"Something weird did happen the other day, though."
m_ex_mast_03_35,"Helm was having trouble cleaning the cabin,"
m_ex_mast_03_36,and kept nagging at me for the longest time.
m_ex_mast_03_37,"Suddenly, Morgan, who was to the side taking this all in,"
m_ex_mast_03_38,"leaps up and shouts,"
m_ex_mast_03_39,Starfish! Starfish!
m_ex_mast_03_40,... Interesting.
m_ex_mast_03_41,"As you can imagine,"
m_ex_mast_03_42,Helm was gobsmacked.
m_ex_mast_03_43,"She stopped pestering me, turned pale as a sheet, and ran off."
m_ex_mast_03_44,"As you know,"
m_ex_mast_03_45,"she's petrified of squishy sea creatures,"
m_ex_mast_03_46,but I don't think Morgan can count on this trick working too many times.
m_ex_mast_03_47,"Otherwise, it'll be a case of the parrot who cried wolf, and Helm eventually won't be scared anymore."
m_ex_mast_03_48,"However, since Morgan is so darn smart,"
m_ex_mast_03_49,"he considered this already, and came up with ways to mix it up."
m_ex_mast_03_50,"So this morning,"
m_ex_mast_03_51,when Helm was about to blow her top
m_ex_mast_03_52,"and unload on Anchor and me regarding the schedule,"
m_ex_mast_03_53,"Morgan piped up and bellowed out a new one,"
m_ex_mast_03_54,Sea anemone! Sea anemone!
m_ex_mast_03_55,Ha!
m_ex_mast_03_56,"And just like that, no more Helm riding our backs! Hehe."
m_ex_mast_03_57,"Just now,"
m_ex_mast_03_58,I saw him practicing for the next one.
m_ex_mast_03_59,"I overheard him squawking, ""Sea squirt! Sea squirt!"""
m_ex_mast_03_60,I've never seen it in my life
m_ex_mast_03_61,I think it may be because
m_ex_mast_03_62,such a hyper-intelligent parrot
m_ex_mast_03_63,Anchor secretly taught him these
m_ex_mast_03_64,that cares for his owner.
m_ex_mast_03_65,"Whoa, would you look at the time?"
m_ex_mast_03_66,I better get going.
m_ex_mast_03_67,"Helm wanted me to take care of something,"
m_ex_mast_03_68,so I better get on that.
m_ex_mast_03_69,I can't always rely on Morgan to cover for me.
m_ex_mast_03_70,The number one solution for avoiding Helm's wrath would be to finish my work on time.
m_ex_mast_03_71,"Well, I'm off then."
m_ex_mast_03_72,Hope you have an exciting day!
m_ex_mast_03_73,You too.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_1,Trainer!
m_ex_happyzoo_01_2,Trainnnnnerrr!!
m_ex_happyzoo_01_3,??
m_ex_happyzoo_01_4,Which do you think tastes better?
m_ex_happyzoo_01_5,Churu or kibbles?
m_ex_happyzoo_01_6,"Nero and I are debating,"
m_ex_happyzoo_01_7,"and she says churu is more delicious,"
m_ex_happyzoo_01_8,but I personally think nothing beats a good bowl of kibble.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_9,Please.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_10,Kibble can't hold a candle to churu.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_11,Kibble is plain ol' food.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_12,Churu is a treat.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_13,It would stand to reason that treats are more delectable than ordinary food.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_14,I'm not so sure I agree.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_15,I don't think either of them is particularly tasty.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_16,They're pretty much the same to me.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_17,What is this blasphemy?!
m_ex_happyzoo_01_18,U=ᴥ=U...
m_ex_happyzoo_01_19,How can you say such a thing UㅜᴥㅜU
m_ex_happyzoo_01_20,You don't like either of them?
m_ex_happyzoo_01_21,Are you serious?
m_ex_happyzoo_01_22,How can someone not like kibble OR churu?!
m_ex_happyzoo_01_23,I can envision Biscuit's drooping ears and tail right now.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_24,Uh... just kidding! I actually think they're both delicious.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_25,Oh U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_happyzoo_01_26,So you can't really choose one or the other?
m_ex_happyzoo_01_27,"They're the same, in that they're both terrible."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_28,But there's no need to say that out loud right now.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_29,Interesting.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_30,I didn't figure you would like both of them.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_31,"If that's the case, I'll bring plenty of churu next time I come to visit."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_32,"Uh... that's okay, you don't have to do that."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_33,"Oooh, you know what would be great? Churu and kibble mixed together."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_34,"Have you ever tried that, Trainer?"
m_ex_happyzoo_01_35,Can't say I have.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_36,Sounds a bit too indulgent for me.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_37,"No way! If you pair two delicious things together,"
m_ex_happyzoo_01_38,then the result will be something super duper delicious!
m_ex_happyzoo_01_39,Let's try it together next time U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_happyzoo_01_40,"No, scratch that! Let's try making some right now."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_41,"Nero, get the best flavor of churu ready."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_42,I'll secure the finest kibble and come to you.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_43,"Okay,"
m_ex_happyzoo_01_44,I'm on it.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_45,"Nero and I will whip this up real quick and come find you, Trainer."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_46,Be sure to save some room.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_47,"Sorry, but I'm already full."
m_ex_happyzoo_01_48,... No one seems to be reading my message.
m_ex_happyzoo_01_49,I better steer clear of the Commander's Room today.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_1,Woof woof woof!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_2,Meow meow meow!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_3,Woof woof woof?
m_ex_happyzoo_02_4,Meow meow meow?
m_ex_happyzoo_02_5,U^ᴥ^U
m_ex_happyzoo_02_6,It appears you like dogs more.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_7,Meow...
m_ex_happyzoo_02_8,It appears you like cats more!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_9,"Actually, I like both."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_10,"I should have known you'd feel that way, Trainer."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_11,"You're the best, Trainer."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_12,"Yeah, totally the best."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_13,Why do you two like me so much?
m_ex_happyzoo_02_14,Hehe!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_15,Lots of reasons!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_16,You're gentle.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_17,Friendly.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_18,Kind.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_19,Handsome.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_20,And above all...
m_ex_happyzoo_02_21,Yes?
m_ex_happyzoo_02_22,You treat us well U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_happyzoo_02_23,Hehe!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_24,"What about you, Nero? How come you like Trainer so much?"
m_ex_happyzoo_02_25,"Basically, my reasons are just like Biscuit's."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_26,There is one big difference though.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_27,Scoops...
m_ex_happyzoo_02_28,Scoops what? Tell meeeeee!
m_ex_happyzoo_02_29,Scoops doesn't annoy me as often.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_30,I suppose that's a compliment?
m_ex_happyzoo_02_31,That's because you have to respect a cat's private space.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_32,Meow.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_33,It's absolutely intended to be a compliment.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_34,Meow.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_35,"You really do understand me, Scoops."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_36,"Well, I don't know about you,"
m_ex_happyzoo_02_37,"but I'm always gonna like Trainer, forever and ever!"
m_ex_happyzoo_02_38,Meow too.
m_ex_happyzoo_02_39,"I appreciate that, both of you."
m_ex_happyzoo_02_40,It's been a while since I received such heartwarming messages over Bla.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_1,Nero has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_2,Nero has invited Biscuit to join the group.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_3,Nero has invited Leona to join the group.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_4,??
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_5,"Whoa, Trainer is in here too? U^ᴥ^U"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_6,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_7,To discuss and share any updates regarding Ruru's condition.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_8,It was my idea to form this group chat.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_9,"I figured it would make it easier for all of us to stay in the loop,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_10,and to help out in any way we can if possible.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_11,Gotcha.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_12,"Well, speaking of, what's Ruru up to at the moment, Nero?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_13,She's grooming Scoops.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_14,No kidding!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_15,"How does it feel to be groomed, Trainer?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_16,It tickles.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_17,Feels good.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_18,Makes sense.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_19,"It's the good kind of tickling, hehe."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_20,Isn't it the best?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_21,It's so warm and tickly.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_22,I wanna get groomed too U´ᴥ`U
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_23,"Next time, you and Leona can do it together."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_24,Really?!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_25,I'd love that!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_26,Can I join?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_27,??
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_28,Is that not okay?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_29,"Hehe, just joking."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_30,I just wanted to see how you'd react.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_31,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_32,"I will do it again for you next time, Scoops."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_33,Thanks.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_34,"I have to say,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_35,Ruru is much smaller in real life than I thought she'd be.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_36,I don't think she's been eating properly over the past few days.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_37,It was hard to watch.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_38,I can only imagine the ordeal that poor thing went through on the streets.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_39,I know...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_40,It's a good thing Nero and the others found her.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_41,If they hadn't...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_42,Why do you think she doesn't want to come to the shelter?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_43,I was wondering that myself.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_44,"She doesn't have any problem with the dogs,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_45,and she gets along with me and Trainer
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_46,like a house on fire.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_47,Are you sure you weren't the only one having fun?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_48,It was a lot of fun playing with her.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_49,Uh-oh...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_50,Do you think I was the only one having fun?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_51,I thought for sure Ruru enjoyed herself too...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_52,"No, it was a lot of fun."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_53,Hehehe
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_54,I just wish Ruru would come to the shelter.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_55,"She'll have a fun time here, I just know it."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_56,We have to give her some time.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_57,She'll warm up to the idea at some point.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_58,Meow
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_59,That's what I think as well.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_60,It's just a matter of time.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_61,"If anything crops up,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_62,post it to this group chat ASAP.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_01_63,Will do.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_1,"Apparently, Ruru decided to finally come to the shelter."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_2,That's great news!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_3,I've gotta start thinking about all the things I wanna do with her U^ᴥ^U
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_4,How is she doing?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_5,"We just finished her physical, and she's sleeping."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_6,Okay.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_7,Did everything go smoothly during the physical?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_8,I discovered cats are rather feisty animals.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_9,I found out it hurts something fierce when a cat bites you.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_10,Hahahaha
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_11,Am I the only one who finds this hilarious?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_12,Leon's messages remind me of Timi.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_13,How is Timi during his physicals?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_14,Timi?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_15,He's always super calm.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_16,There's nothing to worry about with him.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_17,He wouldn't harm a fly.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_18,"If you're curious, you can come and watch his next physical."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_19,... No thanks.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_20,Ouch!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_21,You didn't have to shoot me down so quickly.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_22,How come Nero hasn't been sending any messages?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_23,"Isn't she with you, Zoo Keeper?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_24,She's fast asleep and purring like a diesel engine.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_25,She passed out.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_26,What?!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_27,Excuse me?!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_28,"Sorry, what I mean is that she's sleeping."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_29,Oh... you got me for a moment.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_30,I thought she had fainted or something UㅜᴥㅜU
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_31,I can see how she'd be pretty pooped.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_32,"Apparently, she was out in the rain for hours on end."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_33,She was?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_34,But Nero hates the rain.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_35,Nero and Zoo Keeper really went the extra mile this time around.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_36,That they did.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_37,Be careful that you don't catch a cold.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_38,I'm fine.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_39,"You say that, but put on an extra layer or two just to make sure."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_40,The results from Ruru's physical will be ready soon.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_41,Let me know when you've got them.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_42,Biscuit and I will be waiting.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_02_43,Okay.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_1,Nero has invited Admi to join the group.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_2,Hello.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_3,Hey
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_4,Everyone
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_5,Admi?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_6,"I told Nero that I want to hear about Ruru,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_7,and she invited me here.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_8,Welcome!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_9,"If you want somewhere to talk about Ruru, then you've come to the right place."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_10,Ruru's just about all we talk about here.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_11,"I like talking about cats, too."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_12,Ruru is so adorable.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_13,But...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_14,"Ah, never mind."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_15,"You realize that the quickest way to upset someone is starting a sentence and not finishing it, right?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_16,"Oh, jeez! The last thing I want to do is to make anyone upset."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_17,"Don't worry, I'm not actually angry."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_18,Good.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_19,"Anyway, is Ruru okay?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_20,"When I bumped into her at the toy store,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_21,she didn't seem to be doing too well.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_22,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_23,"Nero, you didn't tell her?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_24,"I figured it would only make her worry, so I didn't tell her."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_25,??
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_26,Ruru...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_27,Her health isn't the greatest right now.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_28,We're pretty much concentrating on palliative care at this point.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_29,What?!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_30,Admi doesn't send any more messages for a while.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_31,"Admi, are you okay?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_32,I...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_33,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_34,Um...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_35,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_36,I'm sorry for asking.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_37,It's okay.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_38,Now I'm super bummed.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_39,I should have pet her more when I saw her today.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_40,"Ruru will always be at the shelter, so come any time."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_41,"Yeah, you're more than welcome U^ᴥ^U"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_42,Okay.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_03_43,I will.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_1,Ruru's become something of a sensation in the Ark.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_2,I can see why.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_3,She is undeniably adorable.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_4,I don't think I've ever seen a cuter cat than her.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_5,Her eyes are so striking.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_6,Meow
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_7,You're all preaching to the choir here.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_8,I wanna see her!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_9,Can I come over tomorrow?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_10,How about we all pay her a visit tomorrow?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_11,Sure.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_12,Ah.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_13,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_14,Um.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_15,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_16,Is it okay if I bring a toy?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_17,I was thinking about her a few days ago and bought one.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_18,Of course you can.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_19,"All right, sounds good!"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_20,"You all should have seen Ruru today,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_21,she was even cuter than usual.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_22,She trundled over to me out of nowhere and started bumping her head up against me.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_23,You should have heard her purring when I scratched under her chin.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_24,I'm jealous...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_25,"If I scratch her tomorrow, do you think she'll purr for me as well?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_26,"I'd say it's a safe bet that she will, yes."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_27,I had a funny experience with Ruru today too.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_28,"I was training with Timi,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_29,and Ruru kept staring at us.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_30,"When I asked if she needed something,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_31,"she plopped down onto the ground and rolled on her back, exposing her belly."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_32,It was a cuteness overload. I couldn't even.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_33,She's so lovely!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_34,I can only imagine how adorable it was.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_35,I got a flower from Ruru.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_36,What?! Really?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_37,Yeah.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_38,Scoops got a flower from Ruru.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_39,I'm so jealous!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_40,We saw the night sky together too.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_41,You're kidding!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_42,"Lol,"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_43,"what a humblebrag, Zoo Keeper."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_44,Hehe
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_45,"Do you think Ruru is cute too, Trainer?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_46,Yes I do.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_47,"No, I don't."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_48,Wha...?!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_49,She's far more than cute. She's absolutely irresistible.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_50,"Jeez, just listen to all of us gushing about her."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_51,We sound like a bunch of lovestruck admirers.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_52,"We should change the name of the group chat to ""Fallen for Ruru""."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_53,Tomorrow couldn't come quickly enough.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_54,I can't imagine my life without her.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_55,I feel the same.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_56,But parting with those we meet is an inevitable part of life.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_57,Let's not dwell on such sad thoughts.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_58,"For the time being, Ruru is healthy enough."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_59,Let's focus on enjoying the present.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_60,Nero is right.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_61,We need to shower her with all our love
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_62,and create as many memories as we can while we still have time.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_63,Sounds like a plan!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_64,I'm gonna kiss Ruru goodnight tonight.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_65,I'm super jelly!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_04_66,Hehe!
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_1,Do you think Ruru arrived where she was going?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_2,I miss her already.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_3,I'm sure she did.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_4,Why do those we love always leave us?
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_5,I think saying goodbye is the hardest thing in the world.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_6,I...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_7,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_8,Uh...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_9,...
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_10,I can't stop thinking about her.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_11,I don't think I can be in this chat anymore.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_12,"Sorry, everyone."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_13,It was fun while it lasted.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_14,I'll come by the shelter when I'm feeling better.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_15,Sure thing. We'll be waiting.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_16,"Take care of yourself, Admi."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_17,Thanks. You too.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_18,Admi left the group chat.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_19,I think I'll leave as well.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_20,Biscuit left the group chat.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_21,"Wherever Ruru is, I'm sure she's happy. She's somewhere where there's no pain or sadness."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_22,"Nero, Zoo Keeper, take care of yourselves."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_23,"If you're ever having a hard time, feel free to get in touch with me."
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_24,Leona left the group chat.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_25,... Nero and I don't talk for a long time.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_26,"Aren't you leaving, Scoops?"
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_27,I don't want to erase the memories we've created.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_28,Me neither.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_29,Then let's not leave.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_30,Let's stay here and continue to treasure the memories we had with Ruru.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_05_31,Let's do that.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_1,Unknown has joined the group.
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_2,skops
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_3,nero
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_4,i lov yu
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_5,thnk yu
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_6,tak kare
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_7,be wel
m_ex_nyanyaparadise_06_8,Unknown left the group chat.
m_ex_all_01_1,"Hey, everyone."
m_ex_all_01_2,This is the Outpost group chat.
m_ex_all_01_3,If you have any complaints
m_ex_all_01_4,or suggestions
m_ex_all_01_5,"during your time here,"
m_ex_all_01_6,feel free to leave them in here.
m_ex_all_01_7,"And most importantly, don't forget"
m_ex_all_01_8,to muster your firepower!
m_ex_all_01_9,"Oooh,"
m_ex_all_01_10,this group chat looks like it'll be fun.
m_ex_all_01_11,"Whenever I'm out of soda,"
m_ex_all_01_12,is this where I can put in a request for a refill?
m_ex_all_01_13,Um... maybe?
m_ex_all_01_14,"I think this is intended for more serious business-related matters, not personal issues."
m_ex_all_01_15,"Aw, shucks."
m_ex_all_01_16,Bummer.
m_ex_all_01_17,"Yeah, total buzzkill!"
m_ex_all_01_18,Why even bother making a group chat
m_ex_all_01_19,when we can just barge into the Commander's Room?
m_ex_all_01_20,Am I not entitled to my privacy?
m_ex_all_01_21,I won't open the door.
m_ex_all_01_22,"Come on,"
m_ex_all_01_23,you oughta be more generous with your time.
m_ex_all_01_24,"One way or another, that door's getting opened."
m_ex_all_01_25,There are ways.
m_ex_all_01_26,Hehe.
m_ex_all_01_27,Lololol
m_ex_all_01_28,XD
m_ex_all_01_29,What are you doing?
m_ex_all_01_30,"You seemed so happy,"
m_ex_all_01_31,so I wanted to join in on the fun.
m_ex_all_01_32,Hahahahahahaha
m_ex_all_01_33,Heheheheheheheh
m_ex_all_01_34,"Commander,"
m_ex_all_01_35,feel free to ignore frivolous requests
m_ex_all_01_36,like the one Anis just mentioned.
m_ex_all_01_37,You don't have to concern yourself with such things.
m_ex_all_01_38,!!
m_ex_all_01_39,!!!
m_ex_all_01_40,Thanks for the advice.
m_ex_all_01_41,You're so mean!
m_ex_all_01_42,You're so mean!!
m_ex_all_01_43,Just let me know whenever you have something important to add.
m_ex_all_01_44,I've got lots to say!
m_ex_all_01_45,Lots and lots.
m_ex_all_01_46,Lotsandlotsandlots
m_ex_all_01_47,I'm turning off notifications.
m_ex_all_02_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_all_02_2,I want to go on a date.
m_ex_all_02_3,Where'd this come from?
m_ex_all_02_4,Talk about random.
m_ex_all_02_5,What do you mean random?
m_ex_all_02_6,You mean you don't want to go on a date with Old-Timer?
m_ex_all_02_7,"Well, sure I do,"
m_ex_all_02_8,but...
m_ex_all_02_9,"Well, I want to too, so I will."
m_ex_all_02_10,"Let's go on a date, Old-Timer."
m_ex_all_02_11,I wanna go on a date too!
m_ex_all_02_12,Master and I can hone our firepower together.
m_ex_all_02_13,Both of you hold your horses.
m_ex_all_02_14,I wanna get in on this action as well.
m_ex_all_02_15,I want to hang out with the Commander as well.
m_ex_all_02_16,Not so fast!
m_ex_all_02_17,I'd like to spend time with Old-Timer too!
m_ex_all_02_18,I think we need to go in order.
m_ex_all_02_19,"Fine,"
m_ex_all_02_20,then I want to be number 1.
m_ex_all_02_21,"I was the first to say it, so I get to go first."
m_ex_all_02_22,What?!
m_ex_all_02_23,That's not allowed!
m_ex_all_02_24,I want a do-over!
m_ex_all_02_25,"No way, Jose."
m_ex_all_02_26,"Aw, this stinks!"
m_ex_all_02_27,Let's not fight.
m_ex_all_02_28,Why don't we let Master decide the order?
m_ex_all_02_29,Me?
m_ex_all_02_30,Why not?
m_ex_all_02_31,We'll respect any order that you choose.
m_ex_all_02_32,"That way, it'll be less contentious."
m_ex_all_02_33,I don't know about that.
m_ex_all_02_34,I agree with Anis and Neon.
m_ex_all_02_35,"As long as it's something you've decided, then I won't have any complaints."
m_ex_all_02_36,I'm all for Old-Timer deciding too.
m_ex_all_02_37,...
m_ex_all_02_38,"Put those brain cells to work and come up with an ordered list, Master."
m_ex_all_02_39,How about we all meet together?
m_ex_all_02_40,How about I don't go on a date with anyone?
m_ex_all_02_41,Everyone together?
m_ex_all_02_42,That's a bit...
m_ex_all_02_43,No.
m_ex_all_02_44,I want you all to myself.
m_ex_all_02_45,I don't mind sharing you with Belorta.
m_ex_all_02_46,"Well, I'm not okay with sharing!"
m_ex_all_02_47,I don't want anyone butting in on the two of us cultivating our firepower.
m_ex_all_02_48,!!
m_ex_all_02_49,Ouch...
m_ex_all_02_50,harsh.
m_ex_all_02_51,You don't want to go on a date with any of us?
m_ex_all_02_52,Don't you like us? :'(
m_ex_all_02_53,Are you not into firepower practice?
m_ex_all_02_54,It's not that...
m_ex_all_02_55,Never mind.
m_ex_all_02_56,Let's just decide ourselves.
m_ex_all_02_57,"Fine by me. Anis, Neon, can you two come by the Toy Store?"
m_ex_all_02_58,Sure thing.
m_ex_all_02_59,On my way.
m_ex_all_02_60,See you in a few.
m_ex_all_02_61,...
m_ex_all_02_62,I better turn off my notifications for a while.
m_ex_all_03_1,A missive from the Observatory.
m_ex_all_03_2,It has come to our attention that
m_ex_all_03_3,"a certain subsection of people in the Outpost are doing the defense work,"
m_ex_all_03_4,while others are often slacking off.
m_ex_all_03_5,We ask that everyone pitch in
m_ex_all_03_6,and please carry out the orders given to them.
m_ex_all_03_7,What? Who's slacking off?
m_ex_all_03_8,Who could do such a thing?
m_ex_all_03_9,"If you ask me,"
m_ex_all_03_10,"I think this is a case of the one who smelled me, dealt it."
m_ex_all_03_11,"Hey, I didn't fart!"
m_ex_all_03_12,"Don't you mean ""thou doth protest too much?"""
m_ex_all_03_13,"Oh yeah, that. Close enough, hehe."
m_ex_all_03_14,"Either way, the fact that Anis is the culprit doesn't change."
m_ex_all_03_15,Very true.
m_ex_all_03_16,Hey!
m_ex_all_03_17,How come I'm the only one in the crosshairs?
m_ex_all_03_18,Because I was referring to
m_ex_all_03_19,one person in particular.
m_ex_all_03_20,Huh?
m_ex_all_03_21,Really?
m_ex_all_03_22,Really.
m_ex_all_03_23,"... It's me, isn't it?"
m_ex_all_03_24,Precisely.
m_ex_all_03_25,Most surprising.
m_ex_all_03_26,Jeez...
m_ex_all_03_27,I didn't know I was hanging out with such a bunch of squares.
m_ex_all_03_28,Hehe...
m_ex_all_03_29,Sorry.
m_ex_all_03_30,I'll report to the Defense Outpost more.
m_ex_all_03_31,How often?
m_ex_all_03_32,"Yeah, how often?"
m_ex_all_03_33,"Good grief, I need to decide that too?!"
m_ex_all_03_34,"Fine, I'll go three times a day."
m_ex_all_03_35,"Breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
m_ex_all_03_36,"Nah, it should be at least five times a day."
m_ex_all_03_37,Totally.
m_ex_all_03_38,Make it six.
m_ex_all_03_39,What did I ever do to you people?
m_ex_all_03_40,"Why are you being like this, Commander?"
m_ex_all_03_41,Let's make it three times.
m_ex_all_03_42,Five might be overdoing it.
m_ex_all_03_43,T_TT_TT_TT_T
m_ex_all_03_44,RapiT_TT_T
m_ex_all_03_45,I always knew you are the only one I could trust.
m_ex_all_03_46,"However, you'll have to do it for at least three days in a row."
m_ex_all_03_47,Huh?
m_ex_all_03_48,Three whole days?
m_ex_all_03_49,... I'm never going to make it out of this alive.
m_ex_all_03_50,"Don't worry, I'll be joining you."
m_ex_all_03_51,You will???
m_ex_all_03_52,"There isn't any reason for you to go, is there, Rapi?"
m_ex_all_03_53,Consider it my punishment for neglecting to properly oversee one of my co-workers.
m_ex_all_03_54,"Hmm, when you put it that way,"
m_ex_all_03_55,I feel like I better tag along too.
m_ex_all_03_56,"Hey, this'll be great!"
m_ex_all_03_57,A nice team-building exercise for the Counters.
m_ex_all_03_58,"Come on, Neon!"
m_ex_all_03_59,No.
m_ex_all_03_60,I changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
m_ex_all_03_61,Consider it an opportunity to enhance your firepower.
m_ex_all_03_62,?!
m_ex_all_03_63,You certainly know how to appeal to Neon's sensibilities.
m_ex_all_03_64,"That's a low blow, bringing up firepower."
m_ex_all_03_65,...
m_ex_all_03_66,Did you say... firepower?
m_ex_all_03_67,She certainly did!
m_ex_all_03_68,"Like, firepower firepower?"
m_ex_all_03_69,"Yes, firepower firepower!"
m_ex_all_03_70,She's officially won over.
m_ex_all_03_71,It's settled! I'm going!
m_ex_all_03_72,For the sake of Counters' firepower!
m_ex_all_03_73,"Delta, please adjust the base defense schedule."
m_ex_all_03_74,Will do.
m_ex_all_04_1,Commander!
m_ex_all_04_2,I found out your secret
m_ex_all_04_3,when it comes to dispatching us.
m_ex_all_04_4,Huh?
m_ex_all_04_5,This can't be good.
m_ex_all_04_6,"Whenever you deploy us, you use that"
m_ex_all_04_7,"Dispatch All button on your tablet,"
m_ex_all_04_8,don't you?
m_ex_all_04_9,!!
m_ex_all_04_10,"Um... no, I don't."
m_ex_all_04_11,I knew it!
m_ex_all_04_12,"I always see you pressing that button,"
m_ex_all_04_13,so that's why I figured I'm always being sent on assignments.
m_ex_all_04_14,What are you talking about?
m_ex_all_04_15,I saw you press it with my own eyes!
m_ex_all_04_16,"If you weren't pressing it, how come I'm always being sent on assignments?"
m_ex_all_04_17,"What can I say, you've got rotten luck."
m_ex_all_04_18,You're saying I'm unlucky?
m_ex_all_04_19,"May I remind you,"
m_ex_all_04_20,that Rapi and I have been here since the very beginning?
m_ex_all_04_21,"When the Outpost was entirely bereft of all other manpower,"
m_ex_all_04_22,"Rapi and I were here, keeping down the fort."
m_ex_all_04_23,"So please, if you would, a little more respect."
m_ex_all_04_24,Wow.
m_ex_all_04_25,No wonder I've been getting selected
m_ex_all_04_26,for so many missions.
m_ex_all_04_27,It's because the Commander
m_ex_all_04_28,has been deploying all of us automatically.
m_ex_all_04_29,Isn't it better that it's automatic?
m_ex_all_04_30,Huh?
m_ex_all_04_31,What makes you say that?
m_ex_all_04_32,Because then I'm not intentionally harassing any of you.
m_ex_all_04_33,Hmm...
m_ex_all_04_34,Huh?
m_ex_all_04_35,You think so?
m_ex_all_04_36,Yeah...
m_ex_all_04_37,"I suppose if you were deploying me intentionally,"
m_ex_all_04_38,I would be a bit more peeved.
m_ex_all_04_39,"On the other hand,"
m_ex_all_04_40,"if it's all being handled by a machine, that makes it seem okay."
m_ex_all_04_41,You're right.
m_ex_all_04_42,There aren't any emotions involved if it's an automatic system.
m_ex_all_04_43,"Having said that,"
m_ex_all_04_44,"if you could use a bit more consideration during our next deployment,"
m_ex_all_04_45,it'd be greatly appreciated.
m_ex_all_04_46,Okay.
m_ex_all_04_47,Good.
m_ex_all_04_48,"Well then, I'll head off on my assignment."
m_ex_all_04_49,Same here.
m_ex_all_05_1,Don't you think it's been a bit chilly
m_ex_all_05_2,in the Fitness Club lately?
m_ex_all_05_3,Huh?
m_ex_all_05_4,What are you talking about?
m_ex_all_05_5,I was sweating bullets today.
m_ex_all_05_6,You're always perspiring.
m_ex_all_05_7,Talk about hitting someone when they're down...
m_ex_all_05_8,Uh-oh... starting to sweat again...
m_ex_all_05_9,Coach is right.
m_ex_all_05_10,You're not exactly an ideal sample size.
m_ex_all_05_11,I ended up cutting my session short because it was such a freezer in there.
m_ex_all_05_12,That's because you're gliding around on a skateboard.
m_ex_all_05_13,"If you were trudging along on foot, you'd break a sweat too."
m_ex_all_05_14,"I did get off the board and walk, and I was freezing cold then too."
m_ex_all_05_15,"How about you, Coach?"
m_ex_all_05_16,Aren't you cold?
m_ex_all_05_17,Hard to say.
m_ex_all_05_18,"Actually, I thought it was a bit hot as well."
m_ex_all_05_19,"That at least means you weren't overly cold, right?"
m_ex_all_05_20,"Hey, don't coerce him."
m_ex_all_05_21,You too?
m_ex_all_05_22,See? I'm not the only one!
m_ex_all_05_23,Maybe it's different for me since I'm not a Nikke?
m_ex_all_05_24,"Hmm, good point."
m_ex_all_05_25,"How about this, Epinel."
m_ex_all_05_26,"I could give you a nice, big hug."
m_ex_all_05_27,That might warm you up a bit and get a good sweat going.
m_ex_all_05_28,No thanks.
m_ex_all_05_29,"Yikes, talk about the cold shoulder."
m_ex_all_05_30,"I'm hurt, but it's also refreshing in a way since you're so frigid."
m_ex_all_05_31,I want to hear other Nikkes' opinions.
m_ex_all_05_32,I don't feel that it's overly cold either.
m_ex_all_05_33,"If anything, I think it's a tad on the warm side."
m_ex_all_05_34,!!!
m_ex_all_05_35,"Finally, someone who gets me!"
m_ex_all_05_36,"It's been a long, lonely road up until this point."
m_ex_all_05_37,Seriously?
m_ex_all_05_38,Am I the only one that feels cold?
m_ex_all_05_39,"If you're really that cold,"
m_ex_all_05_40,then I can show you some exercises that'll get you working up a sweat in no time.
m_ex_all_05_41,"Thanks, but no thanks."
m_ex_all_05_42,I'm just going to train somewhere outside the gym.
m_ex_all_05_43,Somewhere a bit warmer.
m_ex_all_05_44,!!
m_ex_all_05_45,!!
m_ex_all_05_46,I think that's a good idea.
m_ex_all_06_1,"Man,"
m_ex_all_06_2,the weather is absolutely lovely today.
m_ex_all_06_3,Does anyone want to go out on a walk together?
m_ex_all_06_4,A walk?
m_ex_all_06_5,Where are you going?
m_ex_all_06_6,That one place... what's it called again?
m_ex_all_06_7,It's got the statue with the wings.
m_ex_all_06_8,The park with Wings of Victory?
m_ex_all_06_9,The park with Goddess of Victory?
m_ex_all_06_10,That's the one.
m_ex_all_06_11,"You know everything, Trainer!"
m_ex_all_06_12,"It's not a goddess statue,"
m_ex_all_06_13,but it does have these great big wings.
m_ex_all_06_14,Are you talking about the Wings of Victory?
m_ex_all_06_15,That's it!
m_ex_all_06_16,"I'm gonna round up the troops at the shelter,"
m_ex_all_06_17,"get some exercise, and enjoy some treats."
m_ex_all_06_18,Treats?!
m_ex_all_06_19,Treats?
m_ex_all_06_20,I wanna go too!
m_ex_all_06_21,"If Jackal's coming,"
m_ex_all_06_22,then I wanna go.
m_ex_all_06_23,Aren't you part of the A/C unit or whatever it's called?
m_ex_all_06_24,A.C.P.U.!
m_ex_all_06_25,Right.
m_ex_all_06_26,"In that case, I don't want to go."
m_ex_all_06_27,Huh? How come?
m_ex_all_06_28,I prepared some really delicious snacks.
m_ex_all_06_29,You did?
m_ex_all_06_30,"... Okay, I'm back in."
m_ex_all_06_31,"Wow, you were dead set on not going,"
m_ex_all_06_32,but then some tasty treats won you over again.
m_ex_all_06_33,"To be fair, I can see where you're coming from."
m_ex_all_06_34,I'm just happy that all of you are coming.
m_ex_all_06_35,It's gonna be a canine catastrophe.
m_ex_all_06_36,!!
m_ex_all_06_37,What makes you say that?
m_ex_all_06_38,"Hehe, you may well be right."
m_ex_all_06_39,There are definitely gonna be a lot of dogs.
m_ex_all_06_40,"Are you coming too, Trainer?"
m_ex_all_06_41,Me?
m_ex_all_06_42,Yeah!
m_ex_all_06_43,Come and play with us!
m_ex_all_06_44,It'll be fun!
m_ex_all_06_45,Come on!
m_ex_all_06_46,Pleeeaaase?
m_ex_all_06_47,"Okay, let me know when you're here."
m_ex_all_06_48,Woohoo!
m_ex_all_06_49,"See you all later, then!"
m_ex_all_06_50,U>ᴥ<U
m_ex_all_07_1,I hereby decree
m_ex_all_07_2,the laughing competition to be officially underway!
m_ex_all_07_3,"Anyone who is up to the challenge, come forward."
m_ex_all_07_4,Let's see who can laugh the loudest.
m_ex_all_07_5,Hahahaha!!
m_ex_all_07_6,!!
m_ex_all_07_7,A hero could never allow herself to be defeated by a mere giggle.
m_ex_all_07_8,Launching counterattack!
m_ex_all_07_9,Prepare yourselves for a true guffaw.
m_ex_all_07_10,Hahahahahahaha!
m_ex_all_07_11,What are you two doing?
m_ex_all_07_12,Hehehehehehehehe.
m_ex_all_07_13,What does it look like we're doing?
m_ex_all_07_14,We're laughing.
m_ex_all_07_15,"Oh, another challenger has arrived?"
m_ex_all_07_16,I shall not be defeated!
m_ex_all_07_17,Hahahahahahahahahaha!!!!
m_ex_all_07_18,!!!
m_ex_all_07_19,I must ask you all to cease and desist at once!
m_ex_all_07_20,Laughing loudly is a crime.
m_ex_all_07_21,!!!
m_ex_all_07_22,!!!
m_ex_all_07_23,...
m_ex_all_07_24,Isn't it? Poli?
m_ex_all_07_25,"For goodness' sake, Miranda."
m_ex_all_07_26,You're a police officer. How do you not know this?
m_ex_all_07_27,"While it is in fact a misdemeanor,"
m_ex_all_07_28,"this is a group chat, so they're not actually laughing out loud."
m_ex_all_07_29,Let's not get involved
m_ex_all_07_30,and let these bored individuals amuse themselves.
m_ex_all_07_31,"Ah, that's a good point!"
m_ex_all_07_32,"My apologies for intruding, everyone!"
m_ex_all_07_33,"Miranda, out!"
m_ex_all_07_34,"Have fun, bored guys!"
m_ex_all_07_35,Hey! Who said we were bored?
m_ex_all_07_36,Are you not?
m_ex_all_07_37,...
m_ex_all_07_38,"Okay fine, I am bored!"
m_ex_all_07_39,So you know what I'm going to do? Laugh!
m_ex_all_07_40,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
m_ex_all_07_41,!!
m_ex_all_07_42,"We've got a problem, Birdie!"
m_ex_all_07_43,???
m_ex_all_07_44,I forgot to plug in my charger.
m_ex_all_07_45,"I'm about to run out of juice, so I may end up disconnecting soon."
m_ex_all_07_46,Is this the end for our hero?
m_ex_all_07_47,!!!
m_ex_all_07_48,Never!
m_ex_all_07_49,A hero is never vanquished!
m_ex_all_07_50,Full power!!
m_ex_all_07_51,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!
m_ex_all_07_52,!1!!11
m_ex_all_07_53,!1
m_ex_all_07_54,Laplace?
m_ex_all_07_55,"A valiant effort,"
m_ex_all_07_56,but she's done for.
m_ex_all_07_57,She's lost all her zest for life now.
m_ex_all_07_58,"If that desperate laugh is any indication, she's finally met her maker."
m_ex_all_07_59,"As expected, a hero is no match for a villain!"
m_ex_all_07_60,Hahahahahahahahahahahaaahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
m_ex_all_07_61,Whoops.
m_ex_all_07_62,Typo.
m_ex_all_07_63,Hehe.
m_ex_all_07_64,Figures that everything goes to hell in a handbasket while I'm gone.
m_ex_all_07_65,"I, Guillotine de Mephisto,"
m_ex_all_07_66,hereby declare an end to the chaos that has descended upon this land.
m_ex_all_07_67,!!!
m_ex_all_07_68,!!!
m_ex_all_07_69,Hehehehehehe
m_ex_all_07_70,Mwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
m_ex_all_07_71,Hehehehehehehehehe
m_ex_all_07_72,Hmm...
m_ex_all_07_73,That's a pretty solid laugh.
m_ex_all_07_74,I think I'll stop for now.
m_ex_all_07_75,Me too.
m_ex_all_07_76,"Very impressive, Guillotine."
m_ex_all_07_77,Huh?
m_ex_all_07_78,It's over already?
m_ex_all_07_79,No more laughter for now.
m_ex_all_07_80,Bye bye.
m_ex_all_07_81,!!!
m_ex_anis_04_1,Commander!
m_ex_anis_04_2,I'm utterly dumbfounded right now.
m_ex_anis_04_3,What happened?
m_ex_anis_04_4,"Okay, I want an answer from you,"
m_ex_anis_04_5,and it better be the right answer.
m_ex_anis_04_6,What do you think about my body?
m_ex_anis_04_7,What?
m_ex_anis_04_8,Get your mind out of the gutter!
m_ex_anis_04_9,Do you think I have a nice figure?
m_ex_anis_04_10,"It's well-balanced, so yes."
m_ex_anis_04_11,"You've got some attractive musculature, and nice, soft skin."
m_ex_anis_04_12,That's what I think too.
m_ex_anis_04_13,That was very... specific.
m_ex_anis_04_14,*Sigh*
m_ex_anis_04_15,"I went to buy some clothes,"
m_ex_anis_04_16,but nothing fit me.
m_ex_anis_04_17,"I asked the employee if they had anything else, and you know what she said?"
m_ex_anis_04_18,That's you're a bit... stout?
m_ex_anis_04_19,That the clothes were all a size small?
m_ex_anis_04_20,Yes! That's exactly what she said!
m_ex_anis_04_21,She's saying I can't squeeze into any of these clothes because I'm too fat.
m_ex_anis_04_22,"If she'd used a bit of tact and said it indirectly like that, I wouldn't have been upset."
m_ex_anis_04_23,"Instead, she basically said straight to my face that I was a land whale."
m_ex_anis_04_24,Am I really that fat?
m_ex_anis_04_25,Should I go on a diet?
m_ex_anis_04_26,How does a Nikke even go on a diet?
m_ex_anis_04_27,You're just more on the voluptuous side. There's nothing wrong with that.
m_ex_anis_04_28,"Thank you,"
m_ex_anis_04_29,but I'd rather not be hearing these kinds of remarks at a clothing store.
m_ex_anis_04_30,Argh!
m_ex_anis_04_31,"Anyway, thanks for letting me vent."
m_ex_anis_04_32,I've gotta give this some more thought.
m_ex_anis_04_33,Bye.
m_ex_anis_04_34,Bye.
m_ex_anis_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_anis_05_2,remember what I told you before?
m_ex_anis_05_3,Uh...
m_ex_anis_05_4,Oh for crying out loud!
m_ex_anis_05_5,Can't you remember anything?
m_ex_anis_05_6,About you trying to buy clothes?
m_ex_anis_05_7,Remind me again?
m_ex_anis_05_8,There you go!
m_ex_anis_05_9,I knew you couldn't have forgotten.
m_ex_anis_05_10,"I went to buy clothes, and an employee basically called me fat."
m_ex_anis_05_11,"After some rumination, I contacted Emma,"
m_ex_anis_05_12,and you won't believe what happened.
m_ex_anis_05_13,Ladies with our kind of figure
m_ex_anis_05_14,usually have a hard time finding clothes in normal stores that fit properly.
m_ex_anis_05_15,"So I went to a store that Emma frequents,"
m_ex_anis_05_16,and it was unreal.
m_ex_anis_05_17,"I tried on all sorts of outfits, and it was like I couldn't even feel them,"
m_ex_anis_05_18,especially around the chest area.
m_ex_anis_05_19,It was as if I was dressed and undressed at the same time.
m_ex_anis_05_20,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_05_21,"So, did you end up buying a lot of clothes?"
m_ex_anis_05_22,Tons.
m_ex_anis_05_23,"In all the latest styles, too."
m_ex_anis_05_24,It turns out I wasn't overweight
m_ex_anis_05_25,or anything like that.
m_ex_anis_05_26,I was totally normal.
m_ex_anis_05_27,Of course. Your figure right now is perfect as is.
m_ex_anis_05_28,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_05_29,"Thanks for saying that, Commander."
m_ex_anis_05_30,You're the best.
m_ex_anis_05_31,I'll come over and show you some of the new outfits I bought.
m_ex_anis_05_32,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_anis_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_anis_06_2,about the soda in the fridge...
m_ex_anis_06_3,Have you drank it all?
m_ex_anis_06_4,No no.
m_ex_anis_06_5,If you're talking about the one
m_ex_anis_06_6,"I usually drink,"
m_ex_anis_06_7,I just restocked it recently.
m_ex_anis_06_8,Aren't all sodas pretty much the same?
m_ex_anis_06_9,Isn't there more to your life than just soda?
m_ex_anis_06_10,How could you utter such blasphemy?
m_ex_anis_06_11,You could at least try to be more considerate.
m_ex_anis_06_12,"""Oh, great wise Anis, please educate me in the ways of all things soda."""
m_ex_anis_06_13,Something like that.
m_ex_anis_06_14,"""The way you're talking leads me to believe that there must be a new flavor of soda out?"""
m_ex_anis_06_15,Or that.
m_ex_anis_06_16,"If I did say one of those things, what would your reply be?"
m_ex_anis_06_17,Hehehehehe!
m_ex_anis_06_18,"Something along those lines, maybe?"
m_ex_anis_06_19,"Oh, great wise Anis, please educate me in the ways of all things soda."
m_ex_anis_06_20,The way you're talking leads me to believe that there must be a new flavor of soda out?
m_ex_anis_06_21,Hahahaha!
m_ex_anis_06_22,"It was already funny when I imagined it in my mind, but actually hearing you say it was even funnier."
m_ex_anis_06_23,"Anyways,"
m_ex_anis_06_24,listen up.
m_ex_anis_06_25,You know that soda from the one company that I'm always drinking?
m_ex_anis_06_26,"I was getting tired of it,"
m_ex_anis_06_27,"so I started looking around,"
m_ex_anis_06_28,and it turns out that there are all sorts of sodas around!
m_ex_anis_06_29,Did you know this?
m_ex_anis_06_30,All sorts of sodas?  Like beer?
m_ex_anis_06_31,"Pssh, you've gotta broaden your horizons, Commander."
m_ex_anis_06_32,"Judging from my research, these other sodas don't use artificially carbonated water,"
m_ex_anis_06_33,but harvest it from a natural spring where carbonated water flows naturally!
m_ex_anis_06_34,"Oooh, sounds interesting."
m_ex_anis_06_35,"I know, right!?"
m_ex_anis_06_36,How about you and I check it out together?
m_ex_anis_06_37,Sounds good.
m_ex_anis_06_38,"Okay, you promised! Don't forget!"
m_ex_anis_06_39,I'll check out where it's located.
m_ex_anis_06_40,I'll go see what date works best for us to take a little excursion.
m_ex_anis_06_41,"You've gotta take that day off, no matter what!"
m_ex_anis_06_42,"Okay, okay."
m_ex_belorta_04_1,Hello?
m_ex_belorta_04_2,Old-Timer?
m_ex_belorta_04_3,What is it?
m_ex_belorta_04_4,You won't believe it.
m_ex_belorta_04_5,I found a really interesting food recently.
m_ex_belorta_04_6,I'm super curious as to how it tastes.
m_ex_belorta_04_7,Pretty much anything that's edible piques your curiosity.
m_ex_belorta_04_8,Don't you ever talk about anything else other than food?
m_ex_belorta_04_9,Guilty as charged!
m_ex_belorta_04_10,"However, this food I found recently"
m_ex_belorta_04_11,has made me even more curious than usual.
m_ex_belorta_04_12,"Sure, there are plenty of other things we could talk about."
m_ex_belorta_04_13,"Like drinks, or desserts."
m_ex_belorta_04_14,"Wait, I guess those technically count as food too..."
m_ex_belorta_04_15,"Oh well, hehe."
m_ex_belorta_04_16,"Anyway,"
m_ex_belorta_04_17,aren't you wondering what it is?
m_ex_belorta_04_18,I am. What is it?
m_ex_belorta_04_19,Oh no no. It's no fun if I just tell you outright.
m_ex_belorta_04_20,You've gotta guess.
m_ex_belorta_04_21,"It's about 25cm long,"
m_ex_belorta_04_22,and it's got 200 small bumps or so all around it.
m_ex_belorta_04_23,??
m_ex_belorta_04_24,There's a bunch of bloodshot eyes on its backside.
m_ex_belorta_04_25,Hold up a minute.
m_ex_belorta_04_26,What's the matter?
m_ex_belorta_04_27,Are you sure this is a good one?
m_ex_belorta_04_28,This sounds like some kind of bug.
m_ex_belorta_04_29,Positive!
m_ex_belorta_04_30,Amazing! I knew you'd get it eventually.
m_ex_belorta_04_31,It's an edible insect called the dragon centipede.
m_ex_belorta_04_32,It's become quite popular as of late.
m_ex_belorta_04_33,Are you interested in trying it?
m_ex_belorta_04_34,That's a big no from me on insects.
m_ex_belorta_04_35,How come?
m_ex_belorta_04_36,You shouldn't be so picky.
m_ex_belorta_04_37,"Stay here, and I'll bring you one."
m_ex_belorta_04_38,I've gotta get out of here before Belorta brings me something bizarre.
m_ex_belorta_04_39,"Sorry, but I've got to go to work now. See you later."
m_ex_belorta_04_40,"Aw, really? I've got it all ready for you..."
m_ex_belorta_04_41,We'll just have to wait until next time.
m_ex_belorta_05_1,"Hey, Old-Timer,"
m_ex_belorta_05_2,what are you doing?
m_ex_belorta_05_3,Working.
m_ex_belorta_05_4,Sounds like you're busy.
m_ex_belorta_05_5,Are you tired?
m_ex_belorta_05_6,A little.
m_ex_belorta_05_7,What do you do when you're running low on energy?
m_ex_belorta_05_8,I drink something sweet.
m_ex_belorta_05_9,I work out to overcome my fatigue.
m_ex_belorta_05_10,A wonderful choice!
m_ex_belorta_05_11,"We're so compatible, you and I."
m_ex_belorta_05_12,What?
m_ex_belorta_05_13,Doesn't that just make you more exhausted?
m_ex_belorta_05_14,"Whenever you're feeling tired,"
m_ex_belorta_05_15,you should drink something.
m_ex_belorta_05_16,It just so happens that I'm walking past a cafe.
m_ex_belorta_05_17,Would you like me to get you something?
m_ex_belorta_05_18,"That'd be nice, if it's not too much trouble."
m_ex_belorta_05_19,Not at all.
m_ex_belorta_05_20,What flavor do you want?
m_ex_belorta_05_21,What's on the menu?
m_ex_belorta_05_22,"Hmm, let's see..."
m_ex_belorta_05_23,"Hot grande for you iced coffee,"
m_ex_belorta_05_24,with caramel sauce and whipped cocoa.
m_ex_belorta_05_25,??
m_ex_belorta_05_26,"A venti caramel steamed smoothie,"
m_ex_belorta_05_27,topped with green Macha syrup and extra almonds.
m_ex_belorta_05_28,Belorta...
m_ex_belorta_05_29,Yes?
m_ex_belorta_05_30,I have no idea what on earth these drinks are.
m_ex_belorta_05_31,Really?
m_ex_belorta_05_32,They all sound delicious to me.
m_ex_belorta_05_33,Should I just buy whatever sounds good?
m_ex_belorta_05_34,"If I let her do that, she'll end up buying everything on the menu."
m_ex_belorta_05_35,"Actually, I've got somewhere to be, so maybe next time."
m_ex_belorta_05_36,Really? Too bad.
m_ex_belorta_05_37,"Next time, you have to come with me to the cafe."
m_ex_belorta_05_38,Sure thing.
m_ex_belorta_06_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_belorta_06_2,What are you doing? Are you busy?
m_ex_belorta_06_3,Super busy.
m_ex_belorta_06_4,Can you help me out?
m_ex_belorta_06_5,I said I was busy.
m_ex_belorta_06_6,"Come on, don't be like that."
m_ex_belorta_06_7,"Whenever you're busy, it's a good idea to take breaks."
m_ex_belorta_06_8,And this is reaaaalllyy important.
m_ex_belorta_06_9,What is it?
m_ex_belorta_06_10,"I've hatched a plan to make Mica happy,"
m_ex_belorta_06_11,and I need your help.
m_ex_belorta_06_12,How come you're always pestering Mica?
m_ex_belorta_06_13,It's not pestering!
m_ex_belorta_06_14,Everything I do to Mica
m_ex_belorta_06_15,comes from a place of affection.
m_ex_belorta_06_16,"Fine, what exactly is this plan of yours?"
m_ex_belorta_06_17,"Oooh, so you're going to help me?"
m_ex_belorta_06_18,"First off, we've gotta scare the pants off of her."
m_ex_belorta_06_19,So your usual M.O.
m_ex_belorta_06_20,Not at all!
m_ex_belorta_06_21,"Usually I'm just joking,"
m_ex_belorta_06_22,but this time I'm serious.
m_ex_belorta_06_23,I'm placing you in charge of giving her a big scare.
m_ex_belorta_06_24,The only question is: what should we do to her?
m_ex_belorta_06_25,"Scold her for some nonsensical reason, or..."
m_ex_belorta_06_26,I'm already not into this.
m_ex_belorta_06_27,"Then, when she starts crying,"
m_ex_belorta_06_28,"I'll make my grand entrance,"
m_ex_belorta_06_29,and reveal that it was all a prank.
m_ex_belorta_06_30,Then Mica will be super happy and relieved.
m_ex_belorta_06_31,What do you think?
m_ex_belorta_06_32,I don't think anyone will come out of this feeling happy.
m_ex_belorta_06_33,Huh?
m_ex_belorta_06_34,But I'm having fun just talking about it.
m_ex_belorta_06_35,Come back when you have a better plan.
m_ex_belorta_06_36,"Fine, I guess I have no choice."
m_ex_belorta_06_37,I'll just surprise her as usual and tell her it was a prank.
m_ex_belorta_06_38,"Thanks for your time anyways, Old-Timer."
m_ex_delta_04_1,"Hello, Commander."
m_ex_delta_04_2,I heard that you requested a communiqué with me?
m_ex_delta_04_3,"Yes, I wanted to confirm something."
m_ex_delta_04_4,It sounds like an urgent matter.
m_ex_delta_04_5,"Very well,"
m_ex_delta_04_6,I will enact my judgment with the utmost precision and solemnity.
m_ex_delta_04_7,"No, nothing like that."
m_ex_delta_04_8,Hmm?
m_ex_delta_04_9,"Are you speaking in code, perhaps?"
m_ex_delta_04_10,"Once I decipher it, I'll get back to you."
m_ex_delta_04_11,I'm not speaking in code.
m_ex_delta_04_12,Roger!
m_ex_delta_04_13,It's too late. Delta is convinced that I'm speaking to her in some kind of cipher.
m_ex_delta_04_14,I'm being perfectly straightforward.
m_ex_delta_04_15,Roger!
m_ex_delta_04_16,Have you been going to the gym lately?
m_ex_delta_04_17,"If I'm understanding correctly, this is a question to determine whether I've been to the gym recently?"
m_ex_delta_04_18,... That's exactly what I said.
m_ex_delta_04_19,"If that's the case, then the answer is yes."
m_ex_delta_04_20,"Even when I have a full schedule, I never neglect my physical training."
m_ex_delta_04_21,I must be battle-ready at all times.
m_ex_delta_04_22,The gym filed a complaint.
m_ex_delta_04_23,I take it that means
m_ex_delta_04_24,there was a complaint against me?
m_ex_delta_04_25,Yes. They want to ban you.
m_ex_delta_04_26,What?!
m_ex_delta_04_27,May I know the reason?
m_ex_delta_04_28,That's what I wanted to ask you.
m_ex_delta_04_29,Hmm...
m_ex_delta_04_30,I honestly can't think of anything.
m_ex_delta_04_31,All I did was install some sensors in the gym.
m_ex_delta_04_32,There are some open spaces in that facility which are vulnerable to enemy attacks.
m_ex_delta_04_33,"Once any of those sensors detect something moving at more than 12 miles per hour,"
m_ex_delta_04_34,they'll self-detonate.
m_ex_delta_04_35,Go and dismantle those sensors right now!
m_ex_delta_04_36,Go and apologize to the gym right away!
m_ex_delta_04_37,Are you asking me to expose the gym to danger?!
m_ex_delta_04_38,I was merely doing maintenance work on the facility. Why do I have to apologize?!
m_ex_delta_04_39,I don't understand any of this.
m_ex_delta_04_40,It's an Ark facility.
m_ex_delta_04_41,"Yes, and?"
m_ex_delta_04_42,"As you know, Delta, the Ark is a relatively safe place."
m_ex_delta_04_43,Hmm...
m_ex_delta_04_44,I suppose you're right.
m_ex_delta_04_45,"The facility itself may be defenseless, but I neglected to note the fact it's inside the ironclad Ark."
m_ex_delta_04_46,I'll go take down those sensors at once.
m_ex_delta_04_47,Please do.
m_ex_delta_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_delta_05_2,I wanted your opinion on something.
m_ex_delta_05_3,You don't have to be so formal.
m_ex_delta_05_4,The way you speak is a bit awkward...
m_ex_delta_05_5,No?
m_ex_delta_05_6,But I enjoy speaking this way.
m_ex_delta_05_7,"If that's how you feel, there's nothing I can do about that."
m_ex_delta_05_8,I like how I speak.
m_ex_delta_05_9,May I continue?
m_ex_delta_05_10,Go ahead.
m_ex_delta_05_11,Something called a sauna has been a hot topic of conversation lately.
m_ex_delta_05_12,Have you heard of it?
m_ex_delta_05_13,A sauna?
m_ex_delta_05_14,Yes.
m_ex_delta_05_15,"People go inside an intensely hot and humid room,"
m_ex_delta_05_16,and use heated stones to boost the temperature inside
m_ex_delta_05_17,and sweat out all toxins from their bodies.
m_ex_delta_05_18,I heard it's being used as a new military training exercise.
m_ex_delta_05_19,Who told you that?
m_ex_delta_05_20,Signal.
m_ex_delta_05_21,"Perhaps, was I misinformed?"
m_ex_delta_05_22,"You're spot on about how a sauna works, but..."
m_ex_delta_05_23,"And on top of that, if you're well-trained,"
m_ex_delta_05_24,"once you're done sitting in the sauna, you immediately plunge yourself into ice-cold water"
m_ex_delta_05_25,to strengthen your body.
m_ex_delta_05_26,"I figured there might be some benefits to this training,"
m_ex_delta_05_27,so I wanted to hear what you thought about it.
m_ex_delta_05_28,I see.
m_ex_delta_05_29,Do you think it could potentially pose any benefits?
m_ex_delta_05_30,"First, let's experience it ourselves, and then talk about it."
m_ex_delta_05_31,!!
m_ex_delta_05_32,"A man of action, not words."
m_ex_delta_05_33,I understand.
m_ex_delta_05_34,"Very well, I'll prepare myself."
m_ex_delta_05_35,Should I prepare ammunition for a medium-scale mission?
m_ex_delta_05_36,"Please, just bring yourself and nothing else."
m_ex_delta_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_delta_06_2,cleanup of watchtower 4's warehouse is complete.
m_ex_delta_06_3,Very good.
m_ex_delta_06_4,"During the cleanup, I found something rather unusual."
m_ex_delta_06_5,May I ask you to examine it?
m_ex_delta_06_6,Again...?
m_ex_delta_06_7,"If you're busy,"
m_ex_delta_06_8,I can always have Rapi examine it.
m_ex_delta_06_9,Don't do that.
m_ex_delta_06_10,Very well.
m_ex_delta_06_11,Then allow me to give my report.
m_ex_delta_06_12,The object consists of a single board and small circular-shaped pieces
m_ex_delta_06_13,which are spread evenly across the length of the board.
m_ex_delta_06_14,Engraved upon these pieces is unfamiliar text.
m_ex_delta_06_15,Any idea what it could be?
m_ex_delta_06_16,"Perhaps runes, or some kind of cipher."
m_ex_delta_06_17,"At this juncture, it's hard to determine with any certainty."
m_ex_delta_06_18,"Ah, yes."
m_ex_delta_06_19,There are pairs of different colored symbols.
m_ex_delta_06_20,My guess is that it might be an encoded message left by the Raptures.
m_ex_delta_06_21,...!
m_ex_delta_06_22,"You can rest easy, Delta."
m_ex_delta_06_23,How so?
m_ex_delta_06_24,It's an old game called janggi.
m_ex_delta_06_25,I've never heard of it.
m_ex_delta_06_26,The pieces represent people of different ranks such as soldier and king.
m_ex_delta_06_27,Okay.
m_ex_delta_06_28,Players utilize various tactics and strategies to defeat their opponent's king.
m_ex_delta_06_29,Oh!
m_ex_delta_06_30,This game sounds very interesting.
m_ex_delta_06_31,"In fact, it sounds something like a battle."
m_ex_delta_06_32,"If you're interested, I can put you in charge of this janggi game."
m_ex_delta_06_33,I'd like that!
m_ex_delta_06_34,"Your first order of business is to continue your research, along with Signal."
m_ex_delta_06_35,Is that all right?
m_ex_delta_06_36,"Yes, you have my permission. I hope to see positive results from you two."
m_ex_delta_06_37,Thank you!
m_ex_delta_06_38,I'm sure Signal and I
m_ex_delta_06_39,will be able to turn up something.
m_ex_ether_04_1,"No. 7,"
m_ex_ether_04_2,Do you have a moment?
m_ex_ether_04_3,"Yes, what is it?"
m_ex_ether_04_4,You know how I endorse a healthy and cultured lifestyle
m_ex_ether_04_5,for the people that live in the Ark?
m_ex_ether_04_6,"I have lots to say, but decide to drop it."
m_ex_ether_04_7,"Very true, and we're all grateful to you for that."
m_ex_ether_04_8,"Aww, really?"
m_ex_ether_04_9,"What are you up to, showering me with such compliments?"
m_ex_ether_04_10,"Anyway, would you like to be my first test subject?"
m_ex_ether_04_11,You can try the immortality potion that I whipped up last time.
m_ex_ether_04_12,Immortality itself is a fictional construct.
m_ex_ether_04_13,"If anything, I think drinking that potion will kill me sooner."
m_ex_ether_04_14,"Aw, don't be so mean! That's not true."
m_ex_ether_04_15,"Fine then, for the well-being of the people,"
m_ex_ether_04_16,I would appreciate your cooperation in another capacity.
m_ex_ether_04_17,What exactly?
m_ex_ether_04_18,Come in for a physical.
m_ex_ether_04_19,What precisely does that entail?
m_ex_ether_04_20,Not much.
m_ex_ether_04_21,We'll start by measuring your height and weight.
m_ex_ether_04_22,"Then move onto an EKG, brain wave detection, internal organ examination, blood tests, an MRI,"
m_ex_ether_04_23,"allergic reaction panel, a psychological exam, an endoscopy, and a few more routine tests."
m_ex_ether_04_24,The fact that they're all so routine is exactly what's making me nervous...
m_ex_ether_04_25,Whatever do you mean?
m_ex_ether_04_26,"Actually, could I ask you just one small favor?"
m_ex_ether_04_27,Here we go.
m_ex_ether_04_28,"I would like to take a small sample of your bone marrow during the blood test,"
m_ex_ether_04_29,"some tissue samples from your organs during the endoscopy,"
m_ex_ether_04_30,and brain tissue during your MRI.
m_ex_ether_04_31,I'd like to get a closer look at all those.
m_ex_ether_04_32,"That's okay, isn't it?"
m_ex_ether_04_33,...
m_ex_ether_04_34,I don't feel like even answering.
m_ex_ether_04_35,I think I should just ignore Ether's messages from here on out.
m_ex_ether_04_36,No. 7?
m_ex_ether_04_37,Where did you go? Don't be like that.
m_ex_ether_05_1,"No. 7,"
m_ex_ether_05_2,I have a quick question.
m_ex_ether_05_3,I'm busy.
m_ex_ether_05_4,You're lying.
m_ex_ether_05_5,"Come now, I won't bite."
m_ex_ether_05_6,How can I possibly trust you?
m_ex_ether_05_7,You're awfully snippy today.
m_ex_ether_05_8,"Anyways,"
m_ex_ether_05_9,how are you feeling lately?
m_ex_ether_05_10,"My shoulder and hips are a bit stiff, but other than that, fine."
m_ex_ether_05_11,"Even if there was something wrong, I wouldn't tell you."
m_ex_ether_05_12,I knew it.
m_ex_ether_05_13,"So that means there is something bothering you, isn't there?"
m_ex_ether_05_14,It would appear I'm left with no other choice.
m_ex_ether_05_15,I'll have to impart some of my special recovery methods upon you.
m_ex_ether_05_16,I reject any and all medical treatment.
m_ex_ether_05_17,"Don't worry, no medication today."
m_ex_ether_05_18,"I've actually gotten deep into ancient eastern medicine as of late,"
m_ex_ether_05_19,so I wanted to teach you
m_ex_ether_05_20,the acupressure points I found :)
m_ex_ether_05_21,That actually doesn't sound too bad.
m_ex_ether_05_22,See?
m_ex_ether_05_23,"So, starting from your back,"
m_ex_ether_05_24,press hard with your thumb on the back side where your belly button would be.
m_ex_ether_05_25,I might as well humor Ether and do as she says.
m_ex_ether_05_26,Do you feel anything? Feeling better?
m_ex_ether_05_27,"I don't know about feeling better, but it does hurt a bit."
m_ex_ether_05_28,"If it hurts, then that means it's working."
m_ex_ether_05_29,"Next up, we have both of your temples."
m_ex_ether_05_30,Press them hard at the same time.
m_ex_ether_05_31,I follow Ether's instructions and press both my temples.
m_ex_ether_05_32,How's that?
m_ex_ether_05_33,It makes my head hurt.
m_ex_ether_05_34,Oh...
m_ex_ether_05_35,really?
m_ex_ether_05_36,"Apparently the temples aren't the right location, after all."
m_ex_ether_05_37,Thanks for being my test subject :)
m_ex_ether_05_38,...
m_ex_ether_05_39,I've got a guest.
m_ex_ether_05_40,Now I know not to have them press just any old place on their body.
m_ex_ether_05_41,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_ether_05_42,Ether???
m_ex_ether_05_43,There is no reply.
m_ex_ether_06_1,"No. 7,"
m_ex_ether_06_2,there's been something on my mind the past few days.
m_ex_ether_06_3,Would you care to listen?
m_ex_ether_06_4,Have you had trouble finding a willing test subject?
m_ex_ether_06_5,Haha.
m_ex_ether_06_6,"That is indeed one of my concerns, yes,"
m_ex_ether_06_7,but this is something much bigger than that.
m_ex_ether_06_8,What is it?
m_ex_ether_06_9,It's my glasses.
m_ex_ether_06_10,The ones I wear whenever I conduct an experiment.
m_ex_ether_06_11,"Whenever I get too focused, the lenses keep fogging up."
m_ex_ether_06_12,What in the world am I listening to?
m_ex_ether_06_13,"Once that happens, all my focus goes right out the window,"
m_ex_ether_06_14,and I don't want to do anything.
m_ex_ether_06_15,"So, as you can imagine, it's a real conundrum."
m_ex_ether_06_16,Do you think there's any way to stop my lenses from fogging up?
m_ex_ether_06_17,Use contact lenses.
m_ex_ether_06_18,Take off your glasses.
m_ex_ether_06_19,Hmm...
m_ex_ether_06_20,"No, I can't do that."
m_ex_ether_06_21,My glasses are part of my identity.
m_ex_ether_06_22,I can't just toss them to the side.
m_ex_ether_06_23,Why don't you create a substance that prevents your lenses from fogging up?
m_ex_ether_06_24,That's not my area of expertise.
m_ex_ether_06_25,Although...
m_ex_ether_06_26,What if there's no steam coming off of my breath?
m_ex_ether_06_27,I might be onto something here.
m_ex_ether_06_28,???
m_ex_ether_06_29,"Thanks for the advice, No. 7!"
m_ex_ether_06_30,"If I ever bring this experiment to trial,"
m_ex_ether_06_31,I'll be sure to use you as a test subject :)
m_ex_ether_06_32,"No, wait..."
m_ex_ether_06_33,I've gotta get back to work on my project.
m_ex_ether_06_34,Take it easy.
m_ex_ether_06_35,...
m_ex_ether_06_36,I pray that Ether is only joking.
m_ex_mica_04_1,"Hey, Old-Timer,"
m_ex_mica_04_2,do you have a free moment?
m_ex_mica_04_3,What's wrong?
m_ex_mica_04_4,There was something I was hoping I could get your advice on.
m_ex_mica_04_5,That there are no customers coming to the toy store?
m_ex_mica_04_6,"That is a big issue, yes, but this is something"
m_ex_mica_04_7,even more important than that.
m_ex_mica_04_8,What is it?
m_ex_mica_04_9,Do you know a lot about make-up?
m_ex_mica_04_10,Make-up?
m_ex_mica_04_11,Yeah.
m_ex_mica_04_12,"Now that I'm all grown up,"
m_ex_mica_04_13,I feel that I should know a bit more about cosmetics.
m_ex_mica_04_14,Do you really feel you're old enough for all that?
m_ex_mica_04_15,Of course!
m_ex_mica_04_16,"I don't know a whole lot about it myself, but..."
m_ex_mica_04_17,Go on.
m_ex_mica_04_18,Eyebrow makeup is important as it determines the impression of the face!
m_ex_mica_04_19,Dark lipstick that exudes a mature look should be what you're after.
m_ex_mica_04_20,Oh!
m_ex_mica_04_21,Are you sure that won't be too overt?
m_ex_mica_04_22,Make-up should always stand out.
m_ex_mica_04_23,I see.
m_ex_mica_04_24,I'll keep that in mind.
m_ex_mica_04_25,I'm really looking forward
m_ex_mica_04_26,to the next mission now!
m_ex_mica_04_27,What do you mean?
m_ex_mica_04_28,Cause of camouflage makeup.
m_ex_mica_04_29,"I was always taught to blend in on the battlefield,"
m_ex_mica_04_30,"but apparently,"
m_ex_mica_04_31,you should stand out.
m_ex_mica_04_32,"No, that's not"
m_ex_mica_04_33,"Thanks, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_04_34,Talk to you next time.
m_ex_mica_04_35,"Mica, I don't think you quite understand..."
m_ex_mica_04_36,"Mica, however, doesn't reply."
m_ex_mica_05_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_mica_05_2,"I know this is a little sudden,"
m_ex_mica_05_3,but will it rain tomorrow?
m_ex_mica_05_4,What makes you ask?
m_ex_mica_05_5,"Belorta wants to go on a long picnic tomorrow,"
m_ex_mica_05_6,but the news said it's gonna rain tomorrow.
m_ex_mica_05_7,Weather forecasts for this area tend to be really accurate.
m_ex_mica_05_8,"If they say it's gonna rain, then it's almost certainly going to."
m_ex_mica_05_9,Right.
m_ex_mica_05_10,:-'(
m_ex_mica_05_11,Belorta has been asking to hang out for the longest time.
m_ex_mica_05_12,"If it rains, I don't want to go out, so I have to decline her invitation."
m_ex_mica_05_13,Is there no way to make it sunny tomorrow?
m_ex_mica_05_14,You already know the answer to that question.
m_ex_mica_05_15,:-'(
m_ex_mica_05_16,Oh well...
m_ex_mica_05_17,"I already packed a lunch,"
m_ex_mica_05_18,I guess I might as well eat it all.
m_ex_mica_05_19,Would you like to come to the Commander's Room tomorrow?
m_ex_mica_05_20,Huh?
m_ex_mica_05_21,How come?
m_ex_mica_05_22,You could enjoy your picnic here.
m_ex_mica_05_23,Huh?
m_ex_mica_05_24,Can we really do that?
m_ex_mica_05_25,"Of course, although it won't be quite the same as having it outside."
m_ex_mica_05_26,"I don't know,"
m_ex_mica_05_27,I think it'll be really fun.
m_ex_mica_05_28,Will you be there?
m_ex_mica_05_29,I'll make another lunch for you.
m_ex_mica_05_30,"Oh man, I better tell Belorta too."
m_ex_mica_05_31,Sounds great.
m_ex_mica_05_32,Hehe!
m_ex_mica_05_33,"Thanks a bunch, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_05_34,See you tomorrow afternoon.
m_ex_mica_06_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_mica_06_2,I heard that you were looking for me?
m_ex_mica_06_3,I was.
m_ex_mica_06_4,"Wow, no kidding?"
m_ex_mica_06_5,I never thought you'd be the one looking for me.
m_ex_mica_06_6,I was worried about you.
m_ex_mica_06_7,It's because I like you.
m_ex_mica_06_8,"You don't have to worry about me,"
m_ex_mica_06_9,but I appreciate your concern nonetheless.
m_ex_mica_06_10,"Aw, thanks!"
m_ex_mica_06_11,I like you and Belorta too.
m_ex_mica_06_12,"So,"
m_ex_mica_06_13,was there anything you wanted to ask me?
m_ex_mica_06_14,Have you and Belorta been getting along lately?
m_ex_mica_06_15,Of course!
m_ex_mica_06_16,"Only yesterday, she gave me some food that I've never seen before."
m_ex_mica_06_17,Apparently it's really popular.
m_ex_mica_06_18,What was it?
m_ex_mica_06_19,Just a sec.
m_ex_mica_06_20,"I was saving it, so I put it in the fridge, hehe."
m_ex_mica_06_21,Hmm...
m_ex_mica_06_22,"I'm not sure, but it's squishy."
m_ex_mica_06_23,"It's fairly large,"
m_ex_mica_06_24,and there are tiny leg-like appendages attached to it.
m_ex_mica_06_25,??
m_ex_mica_06_26,And there are several pairs of eyes on its back.
m_ex_mica_06_27,Wait!
m_ex_mica_06_28,"Should I try it, since I have it out?"
m_ex_mica_06_29,No!
m_ex_mica_06_30,No?
m_ex_mica_06_31,Eat it with me later.
m_ex_mica_06_32,"Oh, okay!"
m_ex_mica_06_33,That'd be fun.
m_ex_mica_06_34,I'll just put this back in the fridge then.
m_ex_mica_06_35,But you need to come quick.
m_ex_mica_06_36,"Okay, got it."
m_ex_mica_06_37,I've got to visit Mica as soon as I have some spare time.
m_ex_wardress_03_1,Commander
m_ex_wardress_03_2,Mihara and I
m_ex_wardress_03_3,got a strange message.
m_ex_wardress_03_4,Did you get it too?
m_ex_wardress_03_5,Men_and_women all welcome
m_ex_wardress_03_6,Hmm...
m_ex_wardress_03_7,That's different from the message we received.
m_ex_wardress_03_8,Ours was asking for money.
m_ex_wardress_03_9,What kind of websites are you visiting to get spam messages like that?
m_ex_wardress_03_10,Your internet security must be terrible.
m_ex_wardress_03_11,I resent that statement.
m_ex_wardress_03_12,"At any rate, we've been bombarded with spam messages the past few days."
m_ex_wardress_03_13,What should we do?
m_ex_wardress_03_14,You can block them.
m_ex_wardress_03_15,"When we do, they just come through a different number."
m_ex_wardress_03_16,They're nothing if not persistent.
m_ex_wardress_03_17,"In a strange way, I actually admire them for that."
m_ex_wardress_03_18,How about we respond and try to meet them in person?
m_ex_wardress_03_19,I think it would be fun.
m_ex_wardress_03_20,"Yuni, that's... genius!"
m_ex_wardress_03_21,Sounds a bit dangerous to me.
m_ex_wardress_03_22,An undercover investigation?
m_ex_wardress_03_23,To whom?
m_ex_wardress_03_24,Us?
m_ex_wardress_03_25,Or them?
m_ex_wardress_03_26,Precisely.
m_ex_wardress_03_27,"We'll sneak up on 'em without them even knowing, and then boom!"
m_ex_wardress_03_28,This is gonna be fun.
m_ex_wardress_03_29,Just don't go too overboard.
m_ex_wardress_03_30,Soon after.
m_ex_wardress_03_31,"Commander,"
m_ex_wardress_03_32,"we tried contacting them,"
m_ex_wardress_03_33,but they just keep calling me mom
m_ex_wardress_03_34,and asking for money.
m_ex_wardress_03_35,This isn't any fun at all.
m_ex_wardress_03_36,"We keep saying how we want to meet in person, but they aren't listening."
m_ex_wardress_03_37,I'm quickly losing interest.
m_ex_wardress_03_38,"So, we were wondering"
m_ex_wardress_03_39,if we could try contacting some of the spam messages that you got?
m_ex_wardress_03_40,"Yours appear a bit more scandalous, so I think it'll be more titillating."
m_ex_wardress_03_41,No way.
m_ex_wardress_03_42,No?
m_ex_wardress_03_43,Then
m_ex_wardress_03_44,can we come over to you?
m_ex_wardress_03_45,Something tells me that I'm in for a world of pain once those two get here.
m_ex_wardress_03_46,... Just give me a few minutes to prepare myself.
m_ex_wardress_03_47,Sure thing.
m_ex_wardress_03_48,We'll be over in a few.
m_ex_wardress_03_49,"We've got a lot of things we want to do, so we may be there for a while."
m_ex_wardress_03_50,See you later.
m_ex_scouting_03_1,Commanderr!
m_ex_scouting_03_2,Ddelta!
m_ex_scouting_03_3,There's something I've gotta tell you!
m_ex_scouting_03_4,You seem awfully flustered.
m_ex_scouting_03_5,It must be an emergency.
m_ex_scouting_03_6,"Awaiting your orders, Commander."
m_ex_scouting_03_7,We'll provide an urgent support request if necessary.
m_ex_scouting_03_8,"Pump the brakes, Delta."
m_ex_scouting_03_9,"Yes, Sir!"
m_ex_scouting_03_10,We'll stand by until orders are given.
m_ex_scouting_03_11,"It's not what you think, Delta."
m_ex_scouting_03_12,"It's an emergency,"
m_ex_scouting_03_13,but it's got nothing to do with battle.
m_ex_scouting_03_14,Then what is it?
m_ex_scouting_03_15,"I'm not detecting any enemy presence,"
m_ex_scouting_03_16,"but we'll maintain combat readiness for the time being, regardless."
m_ex_scouting_03_17,"Out with it, Signal."
m_ex_scouting_03_18,"Yes, Sir!"
m_ex_scouting_03_19,"Last time, when Delta..."
m_ex_scouting_03_20,You mean me?
m_ex_scouting_03_21,"Yes, who else? When you came back from conducting recon upon the surface,"
m_ex_scouting_03_22,"you brought me a little seed, remember?"
m_ex_scouting_03_23,"Oh, yeah."
m_ex_scouting_03_24,A what?
m_ex_scouting_03_25,A seed!
m_ex_scouting_03_26,I'm positive that
m_ex_scouting_03_27,it only exists up on the surface.
m_ex_scouting_03_28,"When she gave it to me,"
m_ex_scouting_03_29,she proposed that I plant it and watch how it progressed.
m_ex_scouting_03_30,"So, how'd it go?"
m_ex_scouting_03_31,"At first, nothing was happening."
m_ex_scouting_03_32,I figured maybe it could only grow up on the surface.
m_ex_scouting_03_33,"But then one day, I woke up, and there was a little sprout!"
m_ex_scouting_03_34,It's budded?
m_ex_scouting_03_35,"Yeah, and it's adorable!"
m_ex_scouting_03_36,"I'm sorry, Commander."
m_ex_scouting_03_37,"I didn't think it would actually sprout, and I acted without previous authorization."
m_ex_scouting_03_38,"We have acted in violation of the Ark's laws, having illegally smuggled in plant-based contraband and cultivated it."
m_ex_scouting_03_39,Signal and I are willing to accept any punishment you mete out.
m_ex_scouting_03_40,Ah
m_ex_scouting_03_41,Uh-oh...
m_ex_scouting_03_42,It's okay. There's no problem.
m_ex_scouting_03_43,Huh?
m_ex_scouting_03_44,Really?!
m_ex_scouting_03_45,But what if the top brass find out about this?
m_ex_scouting_03_46,"Won't you get in trouble, Commander?"
m_ex_scouting_03_47,"It happened in the Outpost, so it's entirely under my jurisdiction."
m_ex_scouting_03_48,So that means...
m_ex_scouting_03_49,You have to let me see it sometime.
m_ex_scouting_03_50,No problem!
m_ex_scouting_03_51,I'll take good care of it and make it grow big and strong!
m_ex_scouting_03_52,And Delta.
m_ex_scouting_03_53,"Yes, Commander?"
m_ex_scouting_03_54,It's thanks to you that we were able to retrieve a living plant from the surface.
m_ex_scouting_03_55,Oh...
m_ex_scouting_03_56,Well...
m_ex_scouting_03_57,You're welcome.
m_ex_scouting_03_58,I'll try and keep up the good work.
m_ex_scouting_04_1,Commander.
m_ex_scouting_04_2,Reporting in.
m_ex_scouting_04_3,"Within the purview of our allotted reconnaissance, nothing abnormal was found."
m_ex_scouting_04_4,"Although the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased slightly,"
m_ex_scouting_04_5,we do not feel this will result in any significant issues.
m_ex_scouting_04_6,That concludes my report.
m_ex_scouting_04_7,I'll convey my findings next.
m_ex_scouting_04_8,"Neon reported to us that she was hearing strange sounds that could have been some kind of signal,"
m_ex_scouting_04_9,but it was later determined to most likely have been tinnitus.
m_ex_scouting_04_10,And then...
m_ex_scouting_04_11,Er...
m_ex_scouting_04_12,Signal.
m_ex_scouting_04_13,It is imperative that reports are kept quick and concise.
m_ex_scouting_04_14,Sorry...
m_ex_scouting_04_15,"It's all right, take your time."
m_ex_scouting_04_16,"Commander, if you're too lax with her, she may end up becoming entitled."
m_ex_scouting_04_17,It would be advisable to be somewhat stringent at times.
m_ex_scouting_04_18,Understood.
m_ex_scouting_04_19,"It's not a major issue, but it is my fault, and I apologize in advance."
m_ex_scouting_04_20,Do you remember the sprout I told you about last time?
m_ex_scouting_04_21,The one Delta gave to you?
m_ex_scouting_04_22,"In order to avoid any potential misunderstandings,"
m_ex_scouting_04_23,"I'd like to reiterate that the flower was brought back for research purposes,"
m_ex_scouting_04_24,not purely as a gift to Signal.
m_ex_scouting_04_25,How's it doing now?
m_ex_scouting_04_26,"It's grown so quick, you wouldn't believe it."
m_ex_scouting_04_27,A white flower even bloomed on it!
m_ex_scouting_04_28,That's great.
m_ex_scouting_04_29,"I still haven't got a clue what it's called yet, though."
m_ex_scouting_04_30,"I even went to the library and searched the database,"
m_ex_scouting_04_31,but couldn't turn anything up.
m_ex_scouting_04_32,"I feel bad for it, growing up without a name,"
m_ex_scouting_04_33,so I've come up with the perfect moniker for it.
m_ex_scouting_04_34,How'd you come up with a suitable name?
m_ex_scouting_04_35,I wanted to come up with something that
m_ex_scouting_04_36,I feel embodies what this flower represents.
m_ex_scouting_04_37,Is there a specific concept that this flower represents to you?
m_ex_scouting_04_38,Yep!
m_ex_scouting_04_39,"Its appearance reminds me of a white aster,"
m_ex_scouting_04_40,which is a flower which represents 'trust'.
m_ex_scouting_04_41,What do you think?
m_ex_scouting_04_42,Very nice.
m_ex_scouting_04_43,I think it's good too.
m_ex_scouting_04_44,"How did you come up with the notion of trust, though?"
m_ex_scouting_04_45,"It's something that I want to convey to you, Delta."
m_ex_scouting_04_46,"I've always got your back,"
m_ex_scouting_04_47,so you can trust me.
m_ex_scouting_04_48,?!
m_ex_scouting_04_49,I...
m_ex_scouting_04_50,I have some important work to attend to. I'll be back.
m_ex_scouting_04_51,Huh?
m_ex_scouting_04_52,"Commander,"
m_ex_scouting_04_53,do you think Delta is upset?
m_ex_scouting_04_54,Did I say something wrong?
m_ex_scouting_04_55,Don't worry.
m_ex_scouting_04_56,I'm so confused...
m_ex_scouting_04_57,"Delta is quite pleased, I assure you."
m_ex_scouting_04_58,Really?
m_ex_scouting_04_59,"Well, that's a relief."
m_ex_scouting_04_60,I better go look for her.
m_ex_scouting_04_61,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_scouting_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_scouting_05_2,reporting in.
m_ex_scouting_05_3,Nothing out of the ordinary.
m_ex_scouting_05_4,That concludes my report.
m_ex_scouting_05_5,That was brief.
m_ex_scouting_05_6,"Well, nothing is amiss,"
m_ex_scouting_05_7,so why wouldn't it be short?
m_ex_scouting_05_8,"Very well. What about you, Signal?"
m_ex_scouting_05_9,There is no reply.
m_ex_scouting_05_10,Signal?
m_ex_scouting_05_11,"Whoops,"
m_ex_scouting_05_12,sorry!
m_ex_scouting_05_13,"Signal, reporting in."
m_ex_scouting_05_14,Nothing out of the ordinary.
m_ex_scouting_05_15,"Anis and Neon were in an altercation regarding who would get the last piece of pizza,"
m_ex_scouting_05_16,but I left them alone.
m_ex_scouting_05_17,All right.
m_ex_scouting_05_18,That concludes my report.
m_ex_scouting_05_19,"Well done, both of you."
m_ex_scouting_05_20,"Again, there is no reply."
m_ex_scouting_05_21,Hello? Anyone?
m_ex_scouting_05_22,My apologies.
m_ex_scouting_05_23,I'm preparing to head out for a solo training mission.
m_ex_scouting_05_24,"Oh, right! Me too."
m_ex_scouting_05_25,Um... I have to...
m_ex_scouting_05_26,go clean the observer!
m_ex_scouting_05_27,You two sound awfully suspicious.
m_ex_scouting_05_28,Should I help too?
m_ex_scouting_05_29,What do you mean?
m_ex_scouting_05_30,We're not suspicious at all.
m_ex_scouting_05_31,We're just hadr at workk.
m_ex_scouting_05_32,Nononono
m_ex_scouting_05_33,"I wouldn't want to impose and take away your precaipous time, Commanderr."
m_ex_scouting_05_34,There's no need to concern yourself with this.
m_ex_scouting_05_35,You're making quite a few typos.
m_ex_scouting_05_36,...
m_ex_scouting_05_37,Well...
m_ex_scouting_05_38,"to be honest,"
m_ex_scouting_05_39,we're watching Epinel in the skateboarding championship finals.
m_ex_scouting_05_40,"Naturally, the observatory was not meant to be used for this purpose,"
m_ex_scouting_05_41,but we have to cheer on our colleague!
m_ex_scouting_05_42,I don't intend on making excuses.
m_ex_scouting_05_43,We're misappropriating military facilities for our own personal interests.
m_ex_scouting_05_44,I will willingly accept any punishment you lay down.
m_ex_scouting_05_45,Then there's only one way to rectify this situation...
m_ex_scouting_05_46,...
m_ex_scouting_05_47,Let's all go cheer on Epinel together.
m_ex_scouting_05_48,Excuse me?
m_ex_scouting_05_49,"Hurry up, or else we'll be late."
m_ex_scouting_05_50,"Oh, okay! Woohoo!"
m_ex_scouting_05_51,We'll get ready at once.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_1,Mica! Old-Timer!
m_ex_littlecannon_03_2,Are either of you two busy?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_3,Nope! I'm just chillin'.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_4,I'm not doing anything either.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_5,Good.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_6,A question has been burning in my mind.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_7,What is the most delicious thing
m_ex_littlecannon_03_8,you have ever eaten?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_9,You mean like food?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_10,Yes.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_11,"This question popped into my head last night,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_12,and I wanted to ask you two.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_13,Hmm...
m_ex_littlecannon_03_14,I'll have to think about it.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_15,No problem.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_16,"You think it over as well, Old-Timer."
m_ex_littlecannon_03_17,This is a toughie.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_18,"When it comes to food, I like just about everything."
m_ex_littlecannon_03_19,"I know,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_20,that's why I'm so curious to hear your answers.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_21,I can see you're a dyed-in-the-wool foodie like me.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_22,"Still, what was the super duper most scumpdidlyumptious one of them all?"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_23,"Then how about you, Belorta?"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_24,What's the most delicious thing you've ever eaten?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_25,"I mulled it over for a while,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_26,and I think it's the chocolate cake I had at Maid For You.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_27,"Oh, and the cream puff I had at the new cafe I just found."
m_ex_littlecannon_03_28,Those were both out-of-this-world delicious.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_29,I haven't had either of those.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_30,I'll have to take you some time.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_31,Really?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_32,That'd be great!
m_ex_littlecannon_03_33,"Well, Old-Timer, have you come up with anything?"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_34,White rice with a pinch of salt.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_35,Nice and simple.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_36,I'm a fan of salted rice myself.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_37,Salted rice...?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_38,Yes!
m_ex_littlecannon_03_39,What's wrong?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_40,"A long time ago,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_41,"when Mica and I were at the orphanage,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_42,I remember eating something similar.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_43,Huh??
m_ex_littlecannon_03_44,"Food was scarce back then,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_45,so both of us were starving.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_46,"I even passed out from malnutrition,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_47,"but Mica managed to scrounge up some rice,"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_48,"season it with a bit of salt, and rolled it into rice balls."
m_ex_littlecannon_03_49,I can't tell how delicious those tasted.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_50,I did all that?
m_ex_littlecannon_03_51,You sure did.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_52,"So, I've officially decided:"
m_ex_littlecannon_03_53,The most mouth-wateringly delicious thing I've ever eaten
m_ex_littlecannon_03_54,were those rice balls you made for me.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_55,I'm honored!
m_ex_littlecannon_03_56,I'll have to make some more for you sometime.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_57,Hehe.
m_ex_littlecannon_03_58,I'd like that!
m_ex_littlecannon_03_59,"I'm actually looking forward to it myself as well, hehe!"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_2,You've gotta help me!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_3,Help!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_littlecannon_04_5,Ether is calling me in for a health exam.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_6,Why should I have to do that?
m_ex_littlecannon_04_7,"I haven't been sick in ages, and I feel right as rain."
m_ex_littlecannon_04_8,Maybe she thinks you've been eating too much?
m_ex_littlecannon_04_9,I don't eat that much!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_10,Me neither!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_11,"Sure, I typically eat enough meat for 12 people,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_12,"and I once ate 200 takoyakis,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_13,"which was a new record,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_14,but that was a special occasion! I don't eat that much all the time.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_15,I'm fit as a fiddle.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_16,"That may be true now, but it might deteriorate as time goes on."
m_ex_littlecannon_04_17,Uh-oh.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_18,I can't let that happen.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_19,"You're free to eat as much as you want,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_20,"but I want you to stick around for a long while yet,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_21,so you've got to stay healthy.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_22,But I'm as healthy as can be right now!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_23,I've warned you countless times before about your food portions.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_24,"Mountains of rice, fountain drinks the size of swimming pools..."
m_ex_littlecannon_04_25,You wolf them all down with reckless abandon.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_26,You just said I could eat as much as I like!
m_ex_littlecannon_04_27,"Yes,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_28,"but if you want to continue eating as much as you like,"
m_ex_littlecannon_04_29,you've got to mind your health.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_30,"So, let's go and get a health exam done together."
m_ex_littlecannon_04_31,Wait...
m_ex_littlecannon_04_32,you'll come too?
m_ex_littlecannon_04_33,I sure will.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_34,...
m_ex_littlecannon_04_35,Fine.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_36,I'll make an appointment for you both.
m_ex_littlecannon_04_37,"Thanks, Old-Timer."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_1,I've decided.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_2,Huh?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_3,Decided what?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_4,There's something I want to try out.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_5,"I need your help, Old-Timer."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_6,"Oh, this sounds like fun!"
m_ex_littlecannon_05_7,I wanna chip in too!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_8,Really?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_9,You don't even know what it is.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_10,"If you're involved, I'm sure it'll be a blast."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_11,"Hehe, really?"
m_ex_littlecannon_05_12,No take-backs!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_13,Cross my heart.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_14,What are you planning on doing?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_15,I...
m_ex_littlecannon_05_16,am going to film a mukbang!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_17,Muk-what?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_18,I should have known it'd have to do with eating.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_19,Naturally!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_20,Mukbangs are all the rage right now.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_21,"And as we all know, I can pile away food with the best of 'em."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_22,"If I go viral, I could make a small fortune off this."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_23,Where do I come into all this?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_24,"The food, of course."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_25,"You'll be preparing all sorts of scrumptious meals,"
m_ex_littlecannon_05_26,and then Mica and I will go to town on them.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_27,"10 servings for each of us, so 20 in total."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_28,I can't eat that much.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_29,"No take-backs,"
m_ex_littlecannon_05_30,remember?
m_ex_littlecannon_05_31,:-'(
m_ex_littlecannon_05_32,I'll try my best.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_33,That's the spirit!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_34,I'll touch base with you once I've booked a studio.
m_ex_littlecannon_05_35,I never agreed to help...
m_ex_littlecannon_05_36,"Let's go and practice eating, Mica."
m_ex_littlecannon_05_37,All right!
m_ex_littlecannon_05_38,... It may be time to dig into my savings account.
m_ex_soda_04_1,Master!
m_ex_soda_04_2,I finished all of today's cleaning.
m_ex_soda_04_3,Thank you.
m_ex_soda_04_4,You're welcome!
m_ex_soda_04_5,I better go over everything that needs to be done tomorrow.
m_ex_soda_04_6,Aren't you tired?
m_ex_soda_04_7,Sorry?
m_ex_soda_04_8,What do you mean?
m_ex_soda_04_9,I'm practically bursting with energy.
m_ex_soda_04_10,I could clean for ages!
m_ex_soda_04_11,You don't need time to rest?
m_ex_soda_04_12,Haha.
m_ex_soda_04_13,"It can be a bit tiring cleaning every day,"
m_ex_soda_04_14,so I relax every once in a while.
m_ex_soda_04_15,I even took a vacation two days ago.
m_ex_soda_04_16,Where did you go?
m_ex_soda_04_17,I cleaned and tuned up
m_ex_soda_04_18,all my cleaning tools.
m_ex_soda_04_19,It's not often I've got enough spare time to tend to them.
m_ex_soda_04_20,But now they're all sparkling clean.
m_ex_soda_04_21,What else did you do?
m_ex_soda_04_22,You mean besides that?
m_ex_soda_04_23,Let me think...
m_ex_soda_04_24,Oh!
m_ex_soda_04_25,I cleaned the dorm.
m_ex_soda_04_26,Isn't that what you'd normally do on a workday?
m_ex_soda_04_27,"Oh no, it's totally different."
m_ex_soda_04_28,"Don't you worry about me,"
m_ex_soda_04_29,I'm getting plenty of rest.
m_ex_soda_04_30,"Now that my mind's on this topic,"
m_ex_soda_04_31,I should go buy some new cleaning tools during my next vacation.
m_ex_soda_04_32,Then cleaning would be more fun than ever!
m_ex_soda_04_33,Just don't overexert yourself.
m_ex_soda_04_34,You got it.
m_ex_soda_04_35,I appreciate your concern.
m_ex_soda_05_1,Master!
m_ex_soda_05_2,"While I was cleaning the Commander's Room,"
m_ex_soda_05_3,I found a manila folder in the corner.
m_ex_soda_05_4,Did you open it?
m_ex_soda_05_5,Yep.
m_ex_soda_05_6,"At first I thought it was just garbage and was going to throw it out,"
m_ex_soda_05_7,"but when I picked it up, I noticed how hefty it was."
m_ex_soda_05_8,Turns out it was full of books.
m_ex_soda_05_9,"Oh, er... you can just put that back where you found it."
m_ex_soda_05_10,"Oh,"
m_ex_soda_05_11,but I already took them all out
m_ex_soda_05_12,and put them on the bookshelf.
m_ex_soda_05_13,"Technically, they were magazines, not books."
m_ex_soda_05_14,"They're full of good-looking people, too."
m_ex_soda_05_15,So they should be in a place where people can see them.
m_ex_soda_05_16,"No, don't do that!"
m_ex_soda_05_17,You don't want them there?
m_ex_soda_05_18,How about I put them on top of your desk then?
m_ex_soda_05_19,Just put them back where you found them.
m_ex_soda_05_20,"I would, but I already threw away the folder they were in,"
m_ex_soda_05_21,so I can't really find a good place to put them.
m_ex_soda_05_22,I'll just leave them on top of your desk.
m_ex_soda_05_23,"They'll be out in open where you can see them, so you'll be able to find them quickly."
m_ex_soda_05_24,... Right. Thanks.
m_ex_soda_05_25,"I need to get back to the Commander's Room, fast."
m_ex_viper_04_1,"Honey,"
m_ex_viper_04_2,I have a favor to ask of you.
m_ex_viper_04_3,Are you free today?
m_ex_viper_04_4,"Sorry, but I'm busy."
m_ex_viper_04_5,Oh?
m_ex_viper_04_6,Are you now?
m_ex_viper_04_7,Truly?
m_ex_viper_04_8,Yes.
m_ex_viper_04_9,What a bummer.
m_ex_viper_04_10,I thought you of all people
m_ex_viper_04_11,would be willing to help me.
m_ex_viper_04_12,:-'(
m_ex_viper_04_13,Can't you just ask someone else?
m_ex_viper_04_14,Nope.
m_ex_viper_04_15,"You're the only one who can help me, Honey."
m_ex_viper_04_16,I'll make it worth your while.
m_ex_viper_04_17,... Fine.
m_ex_viper_04_18,Really?
m_ex_viper_04_19,I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging high and dry!
m_ex_viper_04_20,I need you to buy me some cosmetics.
m_ex_viper_04_21,What kind?
m_ex_viper_04_22,"It's only on sale for a limited time,"
m_ex_viper_04_23,and I've got a lot on my plate right now.
m_ex_viper_04_24,"I've been dying to get my hands on this, so could you please get it for me?"
m_ex_viper_04_25,I'll tell you exactly what it is you need to get.
m_ex_viper_04_26,This sounds like something anyone could do for you. Why me specifically?
m_ex_viper_04_27,"If this were any ordinary make-up, then you'd be right."
m_ex_viper_04_28,"This, however, is special."
m_ex_viper_04_29,I'm only going to use it when I'm with you.
m_ex_viper_04_30,"As you can see, I can hardly entrust anyone else with such an important task."
m_ex_viper_04_31,"Please, and thank you!"
m_ex_viper_04_32,I feel like I've been tricked.
m_ex_viper_04_33,"Hey, don't talk like that!"
m_ex_viper_04_34,"Also, if you're even a little bit late, they'll be out of stock,"
m_ex_viper_04_35,so get a move on!
m_ex_viper_05_1,Hey!
m_ex_viper_05_2,"I had so much fun today, Honey."
m_ex_viper_05_3,Huh?
m_ex_viper_05_4,I had no idea you were so aggressive.
m_ex_viper_05_5,Hehe!
m_ex_viper_05_6,What are you talking about?
m_ex_viper_05_7,"After you had your way with me,"
m_ex_viper_05_8,how can you pretend not to have a clue?
m_ex_viper_05_9,I'm gonna need an explanation.
m_ex_viper_05_10,"Good grief, you're so dense."
m_ex_viper_05_11,Just play along.
m_ex_viper_05_12,Let's try this again.
m_ex_viper_05_13,You need to act like we're two star-crossed lovers who just came back from a whirlwind rendezvous.
m_ex_viper_05_14,Why are you so obsessed with role-play all of a sudden?
m_ex_viper_05_15,"I need proof that you and I are on good terms,"
m_ex_viper_05_16,so I want to have a record of us having a good time.
m_ex_viper_05_17,Preferably in written form.
m_ex_viper_05_18,I won't do it.
m_ex_viper_05_19,No?
m_ex_viper_05_20,"Personally, I thought it was a good idea."
m_ex_viper_05_21,So you don't want a record of our affection?
m_ex_viper_05_22,Not if it's all an act.
m_ex_viper_05_23,"Ah, I get it now!"
m_ex_viper_05_24,"Fine then, it's not fake whatsoever."
m_ex_viper_05_25,Is this you promising to take me on a proper date?
m_ex_viper_05_26,How did you come to that conclusion?
m_ex_viper_05_27,"If we really do go on a date, then it won't be fake."
m_ex_viper_05_28,A hot date that we don't have to worry about recording for posterity.
m_ex_viper_05_29,Looking forward to seeing unleash your animalistic side!
m_ex_exia_04_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_exia_04_2,got any decent game recommendations?
m_ex_exia_04_3,"There's nothing wrong with gaming, but some physical activity wouldn't kill you."
m_ex_exia_04_4,Sitting still won't kill me either.
m_ex_exia_04_5,So are you a more active person?
m_ex_exia_04_6,Somewhat.
m_ex_exia_04_7,Okay.
m_ex_exia_04_8,"Well, as you know, hackers aren't exactly the most physically fit bunch."
m_ex_exia_04_9,I just don't think being lethargic is good for the body.
m_ex_exia_04_10,"I said it once, and I'll say it again."
m_ex_exia_04_11,It's not like a lack of exercise will kill me.
m_ex_exia_04_12,"I'm a Nikke, after all."
m_ex_exia_04_13,I also get regular check-ups.
m_ex_exia_04_14,You don't need to worry.
m_ex_exia_04_15,Has there ever been a time where my job suffered as a result from inactivity?
m_ex_exia_04_16,That's not what I'm concerned about.
m_ex_exia_04_17,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_exia_04_18,How about this?
m_ex_exia_04_19,"Novel had me join her on one of her detective cases,"
m_ex_exia_04_20,and I spent the entire day wandering around outside.
m_ex_exia_04_21,Did something bad happen?
m_ex_exia_04_22,"No, it was fine."
m_ex_exia_04_23,"I was pretty exhausted when it was over though, moreso than I am on a regular mission."
m_ex_exia_04_24,"When I got back, I passed out without even playing any games."
m_ex_exia_04_25,My conclusion?
m_ex_exia_04_26,Exercise is for the birds. Playing games while plastered to the couch is where it's at.
m_ex_exia_04_27,You can increase your stamina by exercising.
m_ex_exia_04_28,Er...
m_ex_exia_04_29,You are nothing if not persistent.
m_ex_exia_04_30,There's only one thing I can do.
m_ex_exia_04_31,What's that?
m_ex_exia_04_32,Run away.
m_ex_exia_04_33,Byyyyeeeeee!
m_ex_exia_04_34,...
m_ex_exia_05_1,"Noob,"
m_ex_exia_05_2,have you got any good game recommendations?
m_ex_exia_05_3,"I've beaten all the ones I own, so I'm bored."
m_ex_exia_05_4,How about making your own game?
m_ex_exia_05_5,"Ugh, no thanks."
m_ex_exia_05_6,Just thinking about it makes me irritated.
m_ex_exia_05_7,You have the skills though.
m_ex_exia_05_8,How is hacking and video game production comparable?
m_ex_exia_05_9,"Then again, I've never attempted it..."
m_ex_exia_05_10,Hmm...
m_ex_exia_05_11,I suppose I could give it a shot.
m_ex_exia_05_12,It could be a game about you and the other Nikkes.
m_ex_exia_05_13,What genre do you think would be best?
m_ex_exia_05_14,An MMORPG.
m_ex_exia_05_15,A dating sim.
m_ex_exia_05_16,"You, saving the world by vanquishing hideous monsters..."
m_ex_exia_05_17,"You, surrounded by a harem of Nikkes..."
m_ex_exia_05_18,Hmm...
m_ex_exia_05_19,I think I see what you're going for.
m_ex_exia_05_20,"If I do end up going through with this, I'll keep that in mind."
m_ex_exia_05_21,What about you? Is there any specific genre you want to make?
m_ex_exia_05_22,Hmm...
m_ex_exia_05_23,I've never given it much thought.
m_ex_exia_05_24,How about an action shooter?
m_ex_exia_05_25,"You save the world,"
m_ex_exia_05_26,becoming a decorated commander who fights off the invading Rapture hordes.
m_ex_exia_05_27,That's no different from the reality of my life now.
m_ex_exia_05_28,Reality and video games are inherently
m_ex_exia_05_29,two different things.
m_ex_exia_05_30,"If all of this is put inside a game though,"
m_ex_exia_05_31,it could be pretty entertaining to fight the final boss.
m_ex_exia_05_32,I doubt I could get past the first level.
m_ex_exia_05_33,Ha!
m_ex_exia_05_34,"Well, if I end up making it, I'll let you know."
m_ex_novel_04_1,"Watson,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_2,"Not much is, going on, in the Ark, these days,"
m_ex_novel_04_3,"so I figured, I'd come up with, something to pass the time:"
m_ex_novel_04_4,"Detective, Novel's Mystery, Game!"
m_ex_novel_04_5,"What do you think,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_6,Interesting name.
m_ex_novel_04_7,"I think it's pretty nifty,,"
m_ex_novel_04_8,"A true detective, can quickly, get a bead on, another person"
m_ex_novel_04_9,"even if, they don't, speak much,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_10,"So, I'm going to, attempt to,"
m_ex_novel_04_11,"ascertain what, you are doing, this very moment,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_12,"Okay then, guess."
m_ex_novel_04_13,"Hehe,,he,"
m_ex_novel_04_14,"Now I shall, show you my, incredible powers of, deduction,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_15,Let's ssseeee...
m_ex_novel_04_16,I've got it!!
m_ex_novel_04_17,"You're sitting, back and, enjoying some, leisure time, resting,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_18,Amm I right?
m_ex_novel_04_19,No.
m_ex_novel_04_20,"Darn,"
m_ex_novel_04_21,"A minor, hiccupp, notthing more,!!"
m_ex_novel_04_22,"I'll get it, this time for, sure,,."
m_ex_novel_04_23,"Watson, you are..."
m_ex_novel_04_24,"in the, simullation room, no?"
m_ex_novel_04_25,"I'm in the Commander's Room, working."
m_ex_novel_04_26,?!
m_ex_novel_04_27,"This can't be,,"
m_ex_novel_04_28,"How can my powers of, deduction be so off,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_29,How exactly are you arriving at these deductions?
m_ex_novel_04_30,"By listening, to the, supersleuth voices, in my head!!"
m_ex_novel_04_31,"I'm sitting here, having some sweets, and racking my brain,"
m_ex_novel_04_32,"and then thesse, revelatiions come to, me in a flash,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_33,You're having snacks?
m_ex_novel_04_34,?!?!
m_ex_novel_04_35,"How did, you knnow,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_36,"Are you monitoring, me somehow,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_37,You just said that you were having some.
m_ex_novel_04_38,"At this rate, I'll have to cede, my position as supersleuth, to you,,,"
m_ex_novel_04_39,Watson...
m_ex_novel_04_40,"I will get, you for this, one day,"
m_ex_novel_04_41,"mark, my words!!"
m_ex_novel_04_42,"After firing off a one-liner like a movie villain, Novel doesn't contact me for a while."
m_ex_novel_05_1,"Watson, have you heard, of any incidents,,?"
m_ex_novel_05_2,"Peace is, everywhere throughout the, Arkk,"
m_ex_novel_05_3,"These are trying, times for a, dettective,"
m_ex_novel_05_4,"I can feel my, sleuthing skills, deteriorating as, we speak,,,"
m_ex_novel_05_5,At least you've still got enough brain cells to speak.
m_ex_novel_05_6,"Very humorous,,,"
m_ex_novel_05_7,"Anyway, I need something, to focus my, skills on,,"
m_ex_novel_05_8,Isn't sniffing out cases one of the conditions of being a detective?
m_ex_novel_05_9,!!>?!
m_ex_novel_05_10,"I've been, waiting for ages,"
m_ex_novel_05_11,"but, nothing has, come my way,,"
m_ex_novel_05_12,You can go out and look for them.
m_ex_novel_05_13,"So I, should be, a gumshoe,,?"
m_ex_novel_05_14,"I've tried, that already,"
m_ex_novel_05_15,How'd it go?
m_ex_novel_05_16,"I tromped around, the Ark all, day,"
m_ex_novel_05_17,"but all I encountered, were cases about missing, items, misplaced this, forgotten, that, etc,,"
m_ex_novel_05_18,"Not a, single homicide or, burglary case to, be found,,,!!"
m_ex_novel_05_19,"Nothing for, a great detective like, myself to really sink, her teeth into,,,"
m_ex_novel_05_20,"Is there anything, I could help, you with , maybe??"
m_ex_novel_05_21,Loads.
m_ex_novel_05_22,"How low, will I sink,,"
m_ex_novel_05_23,"Stilll,,,"
m_ex_novel_05_24,"it's better, than just loafing, around, I suppose,"
m_ex_novel_05_25,"And helping you, is always a worthwhile, venture,,,"
m_ex_novel_05_26,Make your way to the Commander's Room.
m_ex_novel_05_27,",,Will do,,"
m_ex_novel_05_28,"Be there in a minute,,,"
m_ex_sugar_04_1,Partner.
m_ex_sugar_04_2,"A couple days ago, I wrapped up another assignment as a Scavenger,"
m_ex_sugar_04_3,and I used the money to customize my bike.
m_ex_sugar_04_4,You finally achieved your dream.
m_ex_sugar_04_5,Which part of Black Typhoon is different?
m_ex_sugar_04_6,You of all people should be able to tell.
m_ex_sugar_04_7,"If you were to change anything, it'd probably be the clutch."
m_ex_sugar_04_8,!!!
m_ex_sugar_04_9,Did you swap it for a dry clutch?
m_ex_sugar_04_10,Ooh Partner.
m_ex_sugar_04_11,I feel like I could kiss you right now.
m_ex_sugar_04_12,Swapping in a new clutch is a major modification.
m_ex_sugar_04_13,That it is.
m_ex_sugar_04_14,"It's like a wild stallion that's hard to tame,"
m_ex_sugar_04_15,"but once you've got it under your control, it can ride like the wind."
m_ex_sugar_04_16,"If you let it get the best of you, however, it could end up taking off without you, so I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone."
m_ex_sugar_04_17,Sounds fairly difficult to control.
m_ex_sugar_04_18,Very much so.
m_ex_sugar_04_19,I suppose the same thing can be said of Nikkes.
m_ex_sugar_04_20,How so?
m_ex_sugar_04_21,All of them have such strong personalities.
m_ex_sugar_04_22,They're like wild stallions.
m_ex_sugar_04_23,But it's that same wildness that gives them their edge.
m_ex_sugar_04_24,"When everyone is in sync,"
m_ex_sugar_04_25,they're unstoppable.
m_ex_sugar_04_26,And you do a fantastic job of corralling all those big and bold personalities.
m_ex_sugar_04_27,"In fact,"
m_ex_sugar_04_28,this clutch may be perfect for you.
m_ex_sugar_04_29,Thanks for the advice.
m_ex_sugar_04_30,"The next time I stop by,"
m_ex_sugar_04_31,I'll show you Black Typhoon's new look.
m_ex_sugar_04_32,Sounds good.
m_ex_sugar_05_1,"Partner,"
m_ex_sugar_05_2,are you busy?
m_ex_sugar_05_3,Not at all. I was looking for something to do.
m_ex_sugar_05_4,So busy that I need a distraction.
m_ex_sugar_05_5,That's a good thing.
m_ex_sugar_05_6,"There's an interesting form of travel I've been looking into lately,"
m_ex_sugar_05_7,and I was wondering if you'd like to join me.
m_ex_sugar_05_8,Sounds intriguing.
m_ex_sugar_05_9,I'm sure you'll love it.
m_ex_sugar_05_10,"I know you're a big gearhead, but didn't know you had such a passion for travel."
m_ex_sugar_05_11,"Well, in this case, they're actually one and the same."
m_ex_sugar_05_12,Have you heard of java travel?
m_ex_sugar_05_13,Can't say I have.
m_ex_sugar_05_14,"You take some hot water, coffee grounds, and sugar,"
m_ex_sugar_05_15,then ride your bike off to somewhere far far away.
m_ex_sugar_05_16,"Once you get to your destination, you make yourself a cup of coffee."
m_ex_sugar_05_17,"Okay, now I understand."
m_ex_sugar_05_18,Doesn't it sound invigorating?
m_ex_sugar_05_19,"Riding wild and free, the wind on your face,"
m_ex_sugar_05_20,having just downed a solid cup of joe.
m_ex_sugar_05_21,Sounds magical.
m_ex_sugar_05_22,"If you've got a spare moment, would you like to try it together?"
m_ex_sugar_05_23,I'll bring enough coffee for both of us.
m_ex_sugar_05_24,That would be amazing.
m_ex_sugar_05_25,"I'll bring a healthy amount of sugar too, about 30 cubes."
m_ex_sugar_05_26,Uh...
m_ex_sugar_05_27,"I can't wait to see what you think of it,"
m_ex_sugar_05_28,I'll come pick you up once I'm done preparing everything.
m_ex_milk_04_1,"Pal,"
m_ex_milk_04_2,can you talk for a moment?
m_ex_milk_04_3,"Sure, what's up?"
m_ex_milk_04_4,"There are many different disciplines of martial arts in the world,"
m_ex_milk_04_5,and everyone purports that theirs is the best.
m_ex_milk_04_6,"I've tried them all,"
m_ex_milk_04_7,"and to be honest, I can't tell which comes out on top."
m_ex_milk_04_8,Okay.
m_ex_milk_04_9,"Boxing, Kickboxing, Taekwondo, Karate,"
m_ex_milk_04_10,"Savate, Sambo, MMA, Judo, Sumo, Tai Chi..."
m_ex_milk_04_11,You're learning all of those?
m_ex_milk_04_12,"Oh no, just a select few."
m_ex_milk_04_13,"Anyway, since you've dabbled in martial arts as well,"
m_ex_milk_04_14,I wanted to get your thoughts on the matter.
m_ex_milk_04_15,It doesn't matter which discipline you use. Whoever is strongest will come out on top.
m_ex_milk_04_16,!!!!!!!!
m_ex_milk_04_17,When you put it that way...
m_ex_milk_04_18,I'm jonesing for a sparring match!
m_ex_milk_04_19,Where are you right now?
m_ex_milk_04_20,Let's have a go!
m_ex_milk_04_21,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_milk_05_1,Have you ever heard of Qi
m_ex_milk_05_2,by any chance?
m_ex_milk_05_3,"I think so, but remind me."
m_ex_milk_05_4,"Well, depending on how you use it, it can be utilized in boxing."
m_ex_milk_05_5,I found out a couple days ago
m_ex_milk_05_6,"that if you harness your Qi properly,"
m_ex_milk_05_7,you can send your opponents flying backwards without even touching them.
m_ex_milk_05_8,You can even attack them from a distance.
m_ex_milk_05_9,Where is this going?
m_ex_milk_05_10,"If you've got enough control over your Qi,"
m_ex_milk_05_11,you can condense it into propulsive bursts of air
m_ex_milk_05_12,that can act as bullets.
m_ex_milk_05_13,That can't be true.
m_ex_milk_05_14,"Well, if it is,"
m_ex_milk_05_15,then traditional firearms would be obsolete.
m_ex_milk_05_16,Gone would be the days of worrying about running out of bullets or reloading.
m_ex_milk_05_17,"And the more you trained, the stronger you'd become."
m_ex_milk_05_18,"So,"
m_ex_milk_05_19,train with me!
m_ex_milk_05_20,"You've been reading a bunch of martial arts novels lately, haven't you?"
m_ex_milk_05_21,Huh?
m_ex_milk_05_22,How'd you know?
m_ex_milk_05_23,These kinds of skills only exist in novels.
m_ex_milk_05_24,Really?
m_ex_milk_05_25,Bummer...
m_ex_milk_05_26,"Fine, I'll just do my regular workout."
m_ex_milk_05_27,Fancy a sparring match?
m_ex_milk_05_28,You're on.
m_ex_frima_04_1,Clothes.
m_ex_frima_04_2,What about them?
m_ex_frima_04_3,Don't have.
m_ex_frima_04_4,How?
m_ex_frima_04_5,All.
m_ex_frima_04_6,Took off.
m_ex_frima_04_7,Smelled.
m_ex_frima_04_8,You can change into something else.
m_ex_frima_04_9,No more
m_ex_frima_04_10,clothes.
m_ex_frima_04_11,Why don't you do some laundry?
m_ex_frima_04_12,Washing machine
m_ex_frima_04_13,broken.
m_ex_frima_04_14,Big trouble.
m_ex_frima_04_15,Then what are you going to do?
m_ex_frima_04_16,Clothes.
m_ex_frima_04_17,Deliver.
m_ex_frima_04_18,Please.
m_ex_frima_04_19,Do you want anything in particular?
m_ex_frima_04_20,Hmm...
m_ex_frima_04_21,What do
m_ex_frima_04_22,you
m_ex_frima_04_23,like?
m_ex_frima_04_24,Something innocent.
m_ex_frima_04_25,Something sexy.
m_ex_frima_04_26,Ok.
m_ex_frima_04_27,Off-shoulder.
m_ex_frima_04_28,Torn jeans.
m_ex_frima_04_29,That's how you dress every day.
m_ex_frima_04_30,Please.
m_ex_frima_04_31,Going to
m_ex_frima_04_32,sleep.
m_ex_frima_04_33,I should allot some time to give Frima some new clothes.
m_ex_frima_05_1,Hey.
m_ex_frima_05_2,Hey.
m_ex_frima_05_3,Book
m_ex_frima_05_4,read?
m_ex_frima_05_5,"I've read my fair share, sure."
m_ex_frima_05_6,Really?
m_ex_frima_05_7,"What about you, are you a big reader?"
m_ex_frima_05_8,Yea.
m_ex_frima_05_9,Reading
m_ex_frima_05_10,right now.
m_ex_frima_05_11,I didn't expect you to be such a bookworm.
m_ex_frima_05_12,Yea.
m_ex_frima_05_13,Next page.
m_ex_frima_05_14,Very curious.
m_ex_frima_05_15,Go ahead and keep reading.
m_ex_frima_05_16,Climax.
m_ex_frima_05_17,Soon.
m_ex_frima_05_18,Keep going.
m_ex_frima_05_19,Too lazy.
m_ex_frima_05_20,Can't
m_ex_frima_05_21,flip page.
m_ex_frima_05_22,Come here.
m_ex_frima_05_23,Flip.
m_ex_frima_05_24,Won't it be faster for you to flip the page yourself?
m_ex_frima_05_25,Idea.
m_ex_frima_05_26,??
m_ex_frima_05_27,Pffffhooo!
m_ex_frima_05_28,Blew
m_ex_frima_05_29,like this.
m_ex_frima_05_30,Page
m_ex_frima_05_31,flipped.
m_ex_frima_05_32,... Have fun reading
m_ex_frima_05_33,Ok
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_1,Commanderrrrrr
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_2,"Anis, your profile picture...!"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_3,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_4,Sorry not sorry.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_5,;)
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_6,The only reason I sent you a message was so that you'd see my swimsuit photo.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_7,You look good.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_8,I think so too!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_9,Not too bad
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_10,if I say so myself.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_11,I'm not sure you realize how devastated I was
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_12,when I got separated from the rest of you.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_13,I can understand why you'd be upset at being apart from us.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_14,Nooooo.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_15,"That was part of it, but not all."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_16,"After all that preparation I did,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_17,"and how much I built it up,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_18,"I was so let down, realizing I was never able to show you how I look in a swimsuit."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_19,"Ah, I see."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_20,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_21,"So, are you ready?"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_22,Ready for what?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_23,To beat the heat
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_24,and spend a thrilling summer together with me!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_25,I'm more ready than ever.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_26,"I've got my combat gear on, so I'm not scared of anything."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_27,Then should we head straight to the pool?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_28,That'd be perfect!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_29,Let's go!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_30,Ah.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_31,"I am curious, though."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_32,What kind of swimwear are you going for?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_33,A wetsuit?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_34,No no.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_35,So...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_36,just normal swim trunks then?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_37,"C'mon, telll meeeee."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_38,"You'll at least be going shirtless, won't you?"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_39,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_40,Anis?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_41,Actually...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_42,"Sorry,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_43,but I suddenly feel like
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_44,what I'm wearing isn't the way to go.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_45,Hmm...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_46,Let's hit up the pool next time.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_47,I've gotta better prepare myself.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_01_48,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_1,"On a hot summer's day, nothing beats a..."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_2,Glass of iced coffee.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_3,Glass of ice-cold soda.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_4,Wha...?!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_5,"Commander,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_6,don't tell me you don't know my drink preferences?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_7,You of all people should know I prefer a cold soda.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_8,"Anyways,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_9,You said it!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_10,Nothing like an ice-cold soda to beat the heat.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_11,"On that note,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_12,are you planning on installing an icebox in the Commander's Room?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_13,An icebox?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_14,Yes!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_15,The freezer we've got is way too small.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_16,I end up using all the ice we've got in just one drink.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_17,Can't you just ease up on the ice?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_18,Out of the question.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_19,"If I did that, it'd all melt instantly."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_20,"Besides,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_21,I'm all about munching on the leftover ice.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_22,How about adding more ice cube trays in the freezer?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_23,Hmm...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_24,I don't think there's enough space for that.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_25,"Neon recently bought a few tubs of ice cream,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_26,"and I got a whole buncha soda ice lollies, since they were on sale."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_27,So there isn't much room to spare in the freezer.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_28,Uh-huh.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_29,"C'mon Commander, pleeaaaasee?"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_30,If we have more ice
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_31,you can have an iced coffee whenever you're feeling tired.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_32,"Or, whenever you're getting frustrated, you can treat yourself to ice water and calm your nerves."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_33,There's a whole bunch of other cold drinks you could enjoy too.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_34,Waddya say?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_35,"Fine, we can go shopping for an icebox later."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_36,Yahoo!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_37,"You're not pulling my leg, are you?"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_38,Yipee! This is so exciting!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_39,"Thanks a bunch, Commander!"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_02_40,I owe you big time!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_2,what are you up to?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_3,Thinking about you.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_4,Thinking about the ocean.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_5,"Hehe, sorry,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_6,but that kind of half-hearted flirting won't work on me.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_7,I was thinking about the ocean.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_8,No kidding!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_9,It's like our minds are connected.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_10,I was thinking about the exact same thing.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_11,"I envisioned a sandy beach that was coarse, but soft at the same time..."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_12,The clear and cool
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_13,salty ocean water...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_14,"It's kinda interesting, don't you think?"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_15,What?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_16,"I was thinking of the sea, so I decided to mix some salt into a glass of water and down it."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_17,"Much to my surprise, the taste was totally different from seawater."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_18,Why on earth are you drinking salt water?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_19,I dunno.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_20,"I really miss the sea, I guess :/"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_21,I figured the best way for me to experience it physically
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_22,would be to drink some salt water.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_23,Hmm...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_24,Maybe I need to add more salt?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_25,Wait just a second.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_26,"Anis, stop!"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_27,Anis doesn't answer for a while.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_28,Ugh...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_29,"I only had one sip, but it was disgusting."
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_30,I had to down an entire bottle of normal water to wash away the flavor.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_31,Blech...
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_32,What I'd give to go back in time and not do that.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_33,Are you okay?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_34,Do I sound okay?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_35,I'm totally bummed out!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_36,This experiment of mine is a total bust.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_37,There's only one thing I can do.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_38,?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_39,Let's meet up.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_40,Right now?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_41,Yes.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_42,"I may not be able to feel the ocean, but there's something else I can feel physically,"
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_43,and you've got it.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_44,Hehe.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_45,Be there soon!
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_46,Anis?
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_47,There are no further replies.
m_ex_anis_sparklingsummer_03_48,I need to get ready for when Anis arrives.
m_ex_counters_06_1,Hehe
m_ex_counters_06_2,Hehehehehe!
m_ex_counters_06_3,Hehe
m_ex_counters_06_4,Hehehehehe!
m_ex_counters_06_5,Hehehe!
m_ex_counters_06_6,???
m_ex_counters_06_7,"Commander, why are you laughing?"
m_ex_counters_06_8,"We didn't freak you out, did we, Commander?"
m_ex_counters_06_9,"Ha,"
m_ex_counters_06_10,you're so cute.
m_ex_counters_06_11,"Rapi, hurry and say something."
m_ex_counters_06_12,Rapiiiii
m_ex_counters_06_13,"Gosh,"
m_ex_counters_06_14,she's so stubborn.
m_ex_counters_06_15,"Commander, hurry up and call Rapi, will you?"
m_ex_counters_06_16,Rapi?
m_ex_counters_06_17,"Yes, Commander?"
m_ex_counters_06_18,You changed your profile picture.
m_ex_counters_06_19,Oh my!
m_ex_counters_06_20,I thought you said you weren't going to change it.
m_ex_counters_06_21,"We all agreed to change our profile pics to us in our swimsuits,"
m_ex_counters_06_22,but she said it was a stupid idea.
m_ex_counters_06_23,She even told us to stop coming up with such kooky ideas.
m_ex_counters_06_24,"But lo and behold, she changed her profile pic too!"
m_ex_counters_06_25,Isn't she adorable?
m_ex_counters_06_26,"She fights with us tooth and nail,"
m_ex_counters_06_27,"then goes and changes her profile pic on the sly,"
m_ex_counters_06_28,trying to slip it under our radar.
m_ex_counters_06_29,Rapi.
m_ex_counters_06_30,Yes?
m_ex_counters_06_31,Why did you suddenly change your profile pic?
m_ex_counters_06_32,No reason in particular.
m_ex_counters_06_33,I figured it would help with showing harmony as a team.
m_ex_counters_06_34,Harmony?
m_ex_counters_06_35,As in harm?
m_ex_counters_06_36,Harm?
m_ex_counters_06_37,"As in... guns, which harm people?"
m_ex_counters_06_38,Waterpower?!
m_ex_counters_06_39,Good grief!
m_ex_counters_06_40,"We change our profile pics to us in swimsuits,"
m_ex_counters_06_41,and you've already switched to waterpower.
m_ex_counters_06_42,"I mean, harmony, a sense of unity."
m_ex_counters_06_43,"Anyway,"
m_ex_counters_06_44,we just wanted to let the Commander know that Rapi changed her profile picture :D
m_ex_counters_06_45,:D
m_ex_counters_06_46,Thanks for the reminder.
m_ex_counters_06_47,Hehe
m_ex_counters_06_48,Hehehehe
m_ex_counters_06_49,We better scram before Rapi comes back.
m_ex_counters_06_50,Bye.
m_ex_counters_06_51,Run!
m_ex_counters_07_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_counters_07_2,guess what we're doing right now?
m_ex_counters_07_3,"Anis, I think this should stay between us."
m_ex_counters_07_4,But why?
m_ex_counters_07_5,Don't be so shy!
m_ex_counters_07_6,"Actually, I'm a bit nervous myself..."
m_ex_counters_07_7,Hehehe
m_ex_counters_07_8,What are you all up to now?
m_ex_counters_07_9,Hehehe
m_ex_counters_07_10,Hehehehehe
m_ex_counters_07_11,We swapped swimsuits.
m_ex_counters_07_12,!
m_ex_counters_07_13,I'm wearing Rapi's.
m_ex_counters_07_14,It's like a second skin.
m_ex_counters_07_15,!!
m_ex_counters_07_16,"You'd think that'd make it uncomfortable, but you'd be wrong."
m_ex_counters_07_17,It's actually super comfy.
m_ex_counters_07_18,!!!
m_ex_counters_07_19,Neon is wearing mine.
m_ex_counters_07_20,"Why don't you say something, Neon?"
m_ex_counters_07_21,I'm just feeling a little down on myself.
m_ex_counters_07_22,"Whenever Anis wears it,"
m_ex_counters_07_23,there isn't this much slack at the back when I tie the ribbon.
m_ex_counters_07_24,I'm not in the mood to hone my waterpower anymore.
m_ex_counters_07_25,"For the time being, you're my new master, Anis."
m_ex_counters_07_26,"Thanks, but no thanks."
m_ex_counters_07_27,So is Rapi wearing Neon's swimsuit?
m_ex_counters_07_28,Yep.
m_ex_counters_07_29,Crazy right?
m_ex_counters_07_30,I can hardly believe it myself.
m_ex_counters_07_31,Crazy indeed.
m_ex_counters_07_32,"I've gotta admit though, she pulls it off."
m_ex_counters_07_33,Just a sec.
m_ex_counters_07_34,I'll send you a photo.
m_ex_counters_07_35,"For a while, there's silence."
m_ex_counters_07_36,Master!
m_ex_counters_07_37,It's a real mess over here. Rapi stole Anis' phone.
m_ex_counters_07_38,Hehehehehehehehehe
m_ex_counters_07_39,She's dead set on preventing us from sending a photo.
m_ex_counters_07_40,I'm worried my swimsuit is gonna get ruined in the scuffle...
m_ex_counters_07_41,"That's too bad, I really wanted to see how you all look."
m_ex_counters_07_42,Hehe!
m_ex_counters_07_43,"When the time is right,"
m_ex_counters_07_44,I'll try and send you a photo.
m_ex_counters_07_45,"But before then,"
m_ex_counters_07_46,"I've got to... er, 'develop' in a few areas..."
m_ex_counters_07_47,What about Anis and Rapi?
m_ex_counters_07_48,They are still fighting over the phone.
m_ex_counters_07_49,I think they'll be at it for a while.
m_ex_counters_07_50,"All right, well, you take it easy."
m_ex_counters_07_51,"You too, Master."
m_ex_anchor_01_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_anchor_01_2,Captain.
m_ex_anchor_01_3,"Hey, Anchor."
m_ex_anchor_01_4,"I've seen you around,"
m_ex_anchor_01_5,but now we finally get to work together.
m_ex_anchor_01_6,"I know how busy things have been,"
m_ex_anchor_01_7,and they're only going to get more hectic now.
m_ex_anchor_01_8,"That's all right, it's my job."
m_ex_anchor_01_9,?
m_ex_anchor_01_10,Not you.
m_ex_anchor_01_11,Me.
m_ex_anchor_01_12,Oh. You meant you are going to be busier?
m_ex_anchor_01_13,Yes.
m_ex_anchor_01_14,"I've got to clean the Admire,"
m_ex_anchor_01_15,"prepare meals for the banquets,"
m_ex_anchor_01_16,and wash all the dishes.
m_ex_anchor_01_17,I've got a lot on my plate.
m_ex_anchor_01_18,I see.
m_ex_anchor_01_19,"At any rate,"
m_ex_anchor_01_20,are you a fan of the ocean?
m_ex_anchor_01_21,Very much so.
m_ex_anchor_01_22,Good.
m_ex_anchor_01_23,What's your stance on marine life?
m_ex_anchor_01_24,"I haven't seen much in real life, but I'd say I'm a fan."
m_ex_anchor_01_25,Then I'll introduce you to my friends later on.
m_ex_anchor_01_26,They're nice and soft.
m_ex_anchor_01_27,And squishy too.
m_ex_anchor_01_28,Super cute.
m_ex_anchor_01_29,Sounds great.
m_ex_anchor_01_30,Well.
m_ex_anchor_01_31,"Helm is calling for me,"
m_ex_anchor_01_32,so I've got to go.
m_ex_anchor_01_33,Bye.
m_ex_anchor_02_1,"Captain,"
m_ex_anchor_02_2,I want to quiz you
m_ex_anchor_02_3,on something.
m_ex_anchor_02_4,This is a bit random...
m_ex_anchor_02_5,This starfish is red.
m_ex_anchor_02_6,What kind of starfish is it?
m_ex_anchor_02_7,... A Red Starfish?
m_ex_anchor_02_8,Wow!
m_ex_anchor_02_9,Nicely done!
m_ex_anchor_02_10,"All right, next question."
m_ex_anchor_02_11,Wait a sec
m_ex_anchor_02_12,This starfish looks like a spider.
m_ex_anchor_02_13,What kind of starfish is it?
m_ex_anchor_02_14,A Spider Starfish?
m_ex_anchor_02_15,My goodness.
m_ex_anchor_02_16,You're a natural at this.
m_ex_anchor_02_17,"All right, last question."
m_ex_anchor_02_18,This starfish is shaped like a star.
m_ex_anchor_02_19,What kind of starfish is it?
m_ex_anchor_02_20,Aren't all starfish shaped like stars?
m_ex_anchor_02_21,Not necessarily.
m_ex_anchor_02_22,"They all have slight variations,"
m_ex_anchor_02_23,but this one really does look exactly like a star.
m_ex_anchor_02_24,"So, what kind of starfish is it?"
m_ex_anchor_02_25,A Star Starfish?
m_ex_anchor_02_26,Wow!
m_ex_anchor_02_27,"You really are amazing, Captain."
m_ex_anchor_02_28,You got every single question right.
m_ex_anchor_02_29,How did you know all the answers?
m_ex_anchor_02_30,You practically gave me the answers.
m_ex_anchor_02_31,Next time I'll have to prepare some harder questions.
m_ex_anchor_02_32,"I see you in an entirely different light now, Captain."
m_ex_anchor_02_33,I'll have to study harder myself as well.
m_ex_anchor_02_34,Okay...
m_ex_anchor_02_35,"Anyway, this was fun."
m_ex_anchor_02_36,Bye.
m_ex_anchor_03_1,"Captain,"
m_ex_anchor_03_2,did you just pass by?
m_ex_anchor_03_3,?
m_ex_anchor_03_4,Didn't you come to my room?
m_ex_anchor_03_5,Did you need something?
m_ex_anchor_03_6,Er...
m_ex_anchor_03_7,Where are you running off to?
m_ex_anchor_03_8,Where exactly are you spying on me from?
m_ex_anchor_03_9,I'm not spying at all.
m_ex_anchor_03_10,I'm picking you up from my radar.
m_ex_anchor_03_11,Where are you now?
m_ex_anchor_03_12,Me?
m_ex_anchor_03_13,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_anchor_03_14,"You were in the hallway, but now you've turned around."
m_ex_anchor_03_15,"You must be looking for me,"
m_ex_anchor_03_16,is that it?
m_ex_anchor_03_17,Was it that obvious?
m_ex_anchor_03_18,No.
m_ex_anchor_03_19,Very.
m_ex_anchor_03_20,"Oh, you're not?"
m_ex_anchor_03_21,Then how come you were
m_ex_anchor_03_22,in front of my door
m_ex_anchor_03_23,and pacing through the hallway?
m_ex_anchor_03_24,"... All right, I admit it. I'm looking for you."
m_ex_anchor_03_25,I knew it.
m_ex_anchor_03_26,"Helm put you up to this, didn't she?"
m_ex_anchor_03_27,I managed to slink away during clean-up.
m_ex_anchor_03_28,"It can wait until tomorrow,"
m_ex_anchor_03_29,but she keeps pestering me to get it done today.
m_ex_anchor_03_30,So I hid.
m_ex_anchor_03_31,I see.
m_ex_anchor_03_32,Hm.
m_ex_anchor_03_33,So where are you now?
m_ex_anchor_03_34,I'm not telling.
m_ex_anchor_03_35,You'll just rat on me to Helm.
m_ex_anchor_03_36,The fact that I'm on your radar must mean you're close.
m_ex_anchor_03_37,?!
m_ex_anchor_03_38,You're pretty smart.
m_ex_anchor_03_39,"If I'm not careful, I'm gonna get caught."
m_ex_anchor_03_40,I've gotta get outta here.
m_ex_anchor_03_41,You'll have to look harder.
m_ex_anchor_03_42,Wait
m_ex_anchor_03_43,There are no more replies from Anchor.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_1,"I don't mean to bother you,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_2,but was I all right yesterday?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_3,??
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_4,"Yes, you spoke very clearly during your speech."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_5,"Oh, sorry."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_6,I suppose I should explain.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_7,"No, not that."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_8,I'm talking about my swimsuit.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_9,I was wondering how I looked in it.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_10,"In that case, you were absolutely sublime."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_11,I was tempted to splash you with water.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_12,There's no response from Helm for a while.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_13,I see.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_14,I'm glad to hear that.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_15,I think that was the only issue I had at the moment.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_16,Were there other issues before?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_17,Well...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_18,"the string was a bit too thin,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_19,"and the swimsuit itself was rather revealing,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_20,so I was concerned that I'd have a wardrobe malfunction
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_21,and end up revealing more than I intended
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_22,if the string came loose.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_23,I was constantly checking myself in the mirror
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_24,and using my phone
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_25,to make sure nothing was out of place.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_26,Hmmm
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_27,"Now that I think about it,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_28,I really shouldn't be speaking about such things to a male like you.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_29,Forget everything I just said.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_30,"Sorry, but it's all stuck in my head now."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_31,"Sure thing, hehe."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_32,"I'm begging you, just act as if this conversation never happened."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_33,This is no laughing matter.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_34,Please.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_35,"All right, since you said please."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_36,Good.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_37,"I know it may have seemed like I was fishing for a compliment,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_38,but I wasn't.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_39,And perhaps...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_40,I mean...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_41,If you end up discovering that anything
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_42,"about my swimsuit is out of place,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_43,I'd rather you not pretend as if you didn't see it.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_44,"Instead, could you inform me surreptitiously?"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_45,No problem.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_46,Thank you.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_47,I trust you.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_48,"If there are any other issues in the future, I'll come to you."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_49,"In the meantime, please keep your attention on my swimsuit."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_50,"Oh believe me, I will."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_01_51,It appears I've been assigned the enviable task of keeping a close eye on Helm's alluring swimsuit.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_1,"Honestly,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_2,I don't know what's wrong with people.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_3,What's the matter?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_4,They are always wanting to spray me with water.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_5,"Thank goodness for the drying function of my clothes,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_6,or I'd be walking around all day soaked from head to toe.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_7,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_8,??
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_9,Is that all you have to say?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_10,Maybe the fact that you have that function is what makes people want to spray you with water.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_11,Maybe people get a kick out of how flustered you get.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_12,"A fair observation,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_13,"but if I walk around without my uniform,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_14,surely this clothing is a bit too promiscuous?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_15,It wouldn't be nice for me to keep walking around in public like that.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_16,"Ugh,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_17,this is all such a headache.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_18,"Well,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_19,I can't do anything about that.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_20,"These clothes have been donated to me,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_21,"so I want to wear them and show my gratitude,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_22,but they're so revealing...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_23,It's almost more of a headache than it's worth.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_24,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_25,Perhaps I could
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_26,purchase another swimsuit with my own money?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_27,That's not an option.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_28,I don't think that will change much.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_29,How come?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_30,Because I don't want this swimsuit of yours to go.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_31,What?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_32,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_33,I've never seen this side of you before.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_34,Please don't get rid of this swimsuit.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_35,...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_36,Fine.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_37,"I still don't quite understand why you're acting this way, but I'll take that as an order."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_38,Why not?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_39,I'd rather not say it out loud.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_40,??
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_41,You saying that only makes me more curious.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_42,"I won't force you to say anything you don't want to, but I really would like to know."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_43,"... You have a fantastic body, so it doesn't matter what type of swimsuit you wear."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_44,That's enough!
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_45,I...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_46,I can't text anymore. Too flustered.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_47,So what are you going to do?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_48,I'm not sure.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_49,"I can't change into another swimsuit,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_50,"and people aren't going to stop drenching me with water, no matter how many times I dry myself off."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_51,I just need to learn to put up with it I guess.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_52,"Just think about how happy the rest of them are, thanks to you."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_53,Sorry that you have to go through this.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_54,"Must you say such strange things,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_55,Subordinate?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_56,Even if there really are people
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_57,"who derive pleasure from spraying me with water,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_58,I find such conduct rather unbecoming of adults.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_59,Fair enough.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_60,Yeah.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_61,I appreciate your sympathy.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_62,Anchor and Mast are always poking fun at me
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_63,"because of this,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_64,and I was hoping that you'd be different.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_65,"Anyway, while we're on this topca-qerpi[j1#%(!"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_66,Agh!
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_67,Anchor just sprayed water on me!
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_68,I'll be back in a moment.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_69,I'm going to go after her.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_70,What are you going to do to her?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_02_71,Helm is no longer replying.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_1,I've gotta come up with a way to overcome my fear of starfish.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_2,Got any foolproof methods?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_3,"So it's finally come to this, has it?"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_4,It has.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_5,There was a point in time when I hoped
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_6,"Anchor would grow tired of starfish and marine life,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_7,but I don't see that ever happening.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_8,I think changing my own perspective might prove to be faster.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_9,This is a big decision.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_10,I know.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_11,You're the only person I can turn to for help.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_12,"If I tell Mast, she'll only leap at the opportunity to make fun of me even more."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_13,"Obviously,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_14,confiding in Anchor is out of the question.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_15,Definitely.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_16,So what do you think I should do?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_17,If you can give me a roadmap
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_18,"on how to get over my fear of starfish,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_19,"I'll follow it to the letter, I guarantee it."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_20,How about some exposure therapy?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_21,How about looking at pictures of starfish every day?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_22,That kinda seems like
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_23,I'd be throwing myself in the deep end.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_24,Then start with photos.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_25,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_26,I think I can manage that.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_27,I'll do some research and get back to you.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_28,Helm doesn't respond for a while.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_29,I can't.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_30,I can't do it.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_31,"Even through the screen,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_32,"I can just feel those nasty, squishy buggers."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_33,I can't take it.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_34,Isn't there any other way?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_35,How about positive reinforcement? Think good things about starfish.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_36,That's not a bad idea either.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_37,Let me give it a shot.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_38,Wait.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_39,But I don't have any positive memories about starfish.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_40,"As soon as I think about them, I just get grossed out."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_41,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_42,I look up some information about starfish.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_43,There are these starfish keychains.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_44,What?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_45,How about we get a matching pair?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_46,Like the ones couples have?
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_47,"If you're not into it, we could look into buying starfish plushies or something similar."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_48,No.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_49,I didn't say I didn't like it.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_50,Keychains are nice and small. Hardly harmful.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_51,I think that wouldn't be a bad start.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_52,"If we notice any positive developments because of it,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_53,we can progress to plushies.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_54,You're so motivated.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_55,I just think
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_56,it's a solid idea.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_57,"Every time I start getting freaked out over a starfish,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_58,I can look at that keychain
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_59,and use it to reassure myself everything is fine.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_60,"Whenever you've got time,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_61,go ahead and send me one of those keychains or plushies.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_62,I'll repay you as soon as I can.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_63,"Don't worry, consider it a gift."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_64,"Well,"
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_65,"if you insist, then thanks."
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_66,I'll be looking forward to getting your present then.
m_ex_helm_aquamarine_03_67,I've got some online shopping to do.
m_ex_goldenship_01_1,Mast has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_goldenship_01_2,Mast has invited Frima to join the group.
m_ex_goldenship_01_3,Mast has invited Anchor to join the group.
m_ex_goldenship_01_4,Is everyone packing to go up to the surface?
m_ex_goldenship_01_5,"I assume we'll have to iron out a lot of details,"
m_ex_goldenship_01_6,so I made a special group chat for all of us.
m_ex_goldenship_01_7,Nice.
m_ex_goldenship_01_8,Very nice.
m_ex_goldenship_01_9,Ultra nice.
m_ex_goldenship_01_10,"I set our group name as ""Golden Pirate Crew""!"
m_ex_goldenship_01_11,Hehe
m_ex_goldenship_01_12,It signifies that we're determined to locate the Golden Ship no matter what!
m_ex_goldenship_01_13,Golden?
m_ex_goldenship_01_14,Cool name.
m_ex_goldenship_01_15,You like anything that has the word 'gold' in it.
m_ex_goldenship_01_16,Yep.
m_ex_goldenship_01_17,Very cool.
m_ex_goldenship_01_18,"Me too, actually."
m_ex_goldenship_01_19,Try and muster up some interest in the ship itself while you're at it.
m_ex_goldenship_01_20,Nice.
m_ex_goldenship_01_21,;)
m_ex_goldenship_01_22,Very interested.
m_ex_goldenship_01_23,Golden Ship.
m_ex_goldenship_01_24,Very interesting.
m_ex_goldenship_01_25,"I'm not entirely convinced, but okay."
m_ex_goldenship_01_26,I'm also interested in golden starfish.
m_ex_goldenship_01_27,:p
m_ex_goldenship_01_28,I'm glad that everyone likes the name!
m_ex_goldenship_01_29,Mast
m_ex_goldenship_01_30,But
m_ex_goldenship_01_31,Have you told Helm about this?
m_ex_goldenship_01_32,Huh?
m_ex_goldenship_01_33,About what?
m_ex_goldenship_01_34,That we're going on an adventure.
m_ex_goldenship_01_35,"Oh, that."
m_ex_goldenship_01_36,Isn't it obvious?
m_ex_goldenship_01_37,Obvious that...?
m_ex_goldenship_01_38,Of course I haven't told her yet.
m_ex_goldenship_01_39,I'll get right on that.
m_ex_goldenship_01_40,But
m_ex_goldenship_01_41,what should I say?
m_ex_goldenship_01_42,I can see
m_ex_goldenship_01_43,"her beside herself,"
m_ex_goldenship_01_44,wringing her hands right now.
m_ex_goldenship_01_45,You should still tell her though.
m_ex_goldenship_01_46,I know...
m_ex_goldenship_01_47,I'm certain that she's gonna get on my case about it.
m_ex_goldenship_01_48,:'(
m_ex_goldenship_01_49,"That may be true,"
m_ex_goldenship_01_50,"but if you go without telling her,"
m_ex_goldenship_01_51,she'll only reprimand you more.
m_ex_goldenship_01_52,With a good chewing out or two thrown in.
m_ex_goldenship_01_53,Helm is scary when she gets mad.
m_ex_goldenship_01_54,Helm is kinda cute when she gets mad.
m_ex_goldenship_01_55,That's right.
m_ex_goldenship_01_56,You're telling me.
m_ex_goldenship_01_57,Agreed.
m_ex_goldenship_01_58,?
m_ex_goldenship_01_59,"Captain, you're weird."
m_ex_goldenship_01_60,Helm is terrifying when she's upset.
m_ex_goldenship_01_61,"Yeah, totally."
m_ex_goldenship_01_62,There's nothing cute about it.
m_ex_goldenship_01_63,"It doesn't matter how I spin this,"
m_ex_goldenship_01_64,it's a scary proposition.
m_ex_goldenship_01_65,Maybe I can just send her a message over bla?
m_ex_goldenship_01_66,You're bound to make her upset if you do that.
m_ex_goldenship_01_67,Oh boy...
m_ex_goldenship_01_68,She might end up forcing you to work overtime.
m_ex_goldenship_01_69,You'll end up having to scrub the deck after every party for an entire week.
m_ex_goldenship_01_70,Yikes!
m_ex_goldenship_01_71,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_goldenship_01_72,I'll go tell her now.
m_ex_goldenship_01_73,Good luck.
m_ex_goldenship_02_1,Hey
m_ex_goldenship_02_2,Er
m_ex_goldenship_02_3,Who's this?
m_ex_goldenship_02_4,"Hello, Subordinate."
m_ex_goldenship_02_5,It's Helm.
m_ex_goldenship_02_6,It is?
m_ex_goldenship_02_7,Yes.
m_ex_goldenship_02_8,Sorry if I caught you off guard.
m_ex_goldenship_02_9,What's with the 'Blue EZS' name?
m_ex_goldenship_02_10,EZS is the vessel code
m_ex_goldenship_02_11,"for the Admire,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_12,and blue stands for the ocean.
m_ex_goldenship_02_13,Uh-huh.
m_ex_goldenship_02_14,I'm sorry
m_ex_goldenship_02_15,for bothering you with trivial matters.
m_ex_goldenship_02_16,Why didn't you just send me a personal message?
m_ex_goldenship_02_17,Hmm...
m_ex_goldenship_02_18,I thought you would be with Mast and Anchor.
m_ex_goldenship_02_19,If I sent you a message
m_ex_goldenship_02_20,and they happened to see a notification from me...
m_ex_goldenship_02_21,You don't want them knowing you're in contact with me?
m_ex_goldenship_02_22,Yes.
m_ex_goldenship_02_23,A little bit.
m_ex_goldenship_02_24,Why's that?
m_ex_goldenship_02_25,Er...
m_ex_goldenship_02_26,Well...
m_ex_goldenship_02_27,"It's the first time either of them has been sent out to the desert,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_28,so I wanted to see how they were doing.
m_ex_goldenship_02_29,They're doing just fine.
m_ex_goldenship_02_30,"Okay,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_31,good.
m_ex_goldenship_02_32,So you wanted to see if they're adjusting to the surroundings okay?
m_ex_goldenship_02_33,That's not the only reason.
m_ex_goldenship_02_34,It's just that
m_ex_goldenship_02_35,we've always prepared ourselves for naval-based missions.
m_ex_goldenship_02_36,Our training has taken place exclusively in and around water.
m_ex_goldenship_02_37,They might have trouble adapting to a desert environment.
m_ex_goldenship_02_38,"Ha, I can see you're quite worried about them."
m_ex_goldenship_02_39,Er...
m_ex_goldenship_02_40,Don't laugh!
m_ex_goldenship_02_41,"I shouldn't have to explain this,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_42,but I'm the leader of the Aegis Squad.
m_ex_goldenship_02_43,Seeing how my squadmates are doing
m_ex_goldenship_02_44,is part of my job.
m_ex_goldenship_02_45,"Don't you worry. Actually, we even had time to hang out at the beach today."
m_ex_goldenship_02_46,!!
m_ex_goldenship_02_47,I see...
m_ex_goldenship_02_48,So you went to the ocean?
m_ex_goldenship_02_49,"You're not just immersed in the desert, then."
m_ex_goldenship_02_50,That's... nice.
m_ex_goldenship_02_51,Yep.
m_ex_goldenship_02_52,That's good.
m_ex_goldenship_02_53,We might end up actually catching a glimpse of the Golden Ship.
m_ex_goldenship_02_54,The Golden Ship?
m_ex_goldenship_02_55,"Oh yes, now I remember."
m_ex_goldenship_02_56,Mast is obsessed with that kind of stuff.
m_ex_goldenship_02_57,"Um... Subordinate,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_58,"this is a bit embarrassing to say,"
m_ex_goldenship_02_59,but please look after Mast and Anchor.
m_ex_goldenship_02_60,"Don't worry, I will. We'll be back before you know it."
m_ex_goldenship_02_61,Thanks.
m_ex_goldenship_02_62,And don't tell them that
m_ex_goldenship_02_63,we had this conversation.
m_ex_goldenship_02_64,My lips are sealed.
m_ex_goldenship_02_65,Good. I know you can keep a secret.
m_ex_goldenship_02_66,Blue EZS left the group chat.
m_ex_goldenship_03_1,Did everyone get home safely?
m_ex_goldenship_03_2,"Yeah, I'm in the Commander's Room."
m_ex_goldenship_03_3,How about Frima?
m_ex_goldenship_03_4,Yeah.
m_ex_goldenship_03_5,At Cafe.
m_ex_goldenship_03_6,Anchor?
m_ex_goldenship_03_7,?
m_ex_goldenship_03_8,You literally just said goodbye to me
m_ex_goldenship_03_9,in the hallway.
m_ex_goldenship_03_10,"I know,"
m_ex_goldenship_03_11,but who's to say something couldn't have happened between then and now?
m_ex_goldenship_03_12,"Besides, since everyone else is reporting in,"
m_ex_goldenship_03_13,you might as well do the same.
m_ex_goldenship_03_14,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_goldenship_03_15,I arrived back safe and sound.
m_ex_goldenship_03_16,Morgan and I are all good as well.
m_ex_goldenship_03_17,Oh.
m_ex_goldenship_03_18,One thing.
m_ex_goldenship_03_19,Golden drink.
m_ex_goldenship_03_20,Where?
m_ex_goldenship_03_21,"Didn't you take it with you, Captain?"
m_ex_goldenship_03_22,I did.
m_ex_goldenship_03_23,"Okay, good."
m_ex_goldenship_03_24,I thought we'd gotten distracted by the Golden Ship
m_ex_goldenship_03_25,and left it there.
m_ex_goldenship_03_26,I was so mesmerized by the Golden Ship
m_ex_goldenship_03_27,that I forgot all about the elixir myself.
m_ex_goldenship_03_28,It was only when we were
m_ex_goldenship_03_29,on the elevator leading down to the Ark
m_ex_goldenship_03_30,that I realized I'd forgotten to bring it.
m_ex_goldenship_03_31,"Yeah, everyone seemed a bit out of it, so I made sure to bring it."
m_ex_goldenship_03_32,Good.
m_ex_goldenship_03_33,Can't be leaving precious treasure like this behind.
m_ex_goldenship_03_34,!
m_ex_goldenship_03_35,Very good.
m_ex_goldenship_03_36,Do you want to drink some now?
m_ex_goldenship_03_37,No.
m_ex_goldenship_03_38,Said I drank it.
m_ex_goldenship_03_39,Sugar and Milk
m_ex_goldenship_03_40,want some.
m_ex_goldenship_03_41,We can always share.
m_ex_goldenship_03_42,No!
m_ex_goldenship_03_43,Waste.
m_ex_goldenship_03_44,"Heh, maybe you're right."
m_ex_goldenship_03_45,"Yeah, we shouldn't be too generous with it."
m_ex_goldenship_03_46,Definitely.
m_ex_goldenship_03_47,"Well, for the time being,"
m_ex_goldenship_03_48,"we'll leave the bottle with you, Captain."
m_ex_goldenship_03_49,"Whenever adventure comes knocking,"
m_ex_goldenship_03_50,the Golden Pirates will
m_ex_goldenship_03_51,band together once again
m_ex_goldenship_03_52,and have a few swigs of the fabled elixir!
m_ex_goldenship_03_53,Good idea.
m_ex_goldenship_03_54,I like it.
m_ex_goldenship_03_55,Until next time!
m_ex_goldenship_03_56,Okay.
m_ex_goldenship_03_57,See you around.
m_ex_goldenship_03_58,Bye bye.
m_ex_goldenship_04_1,Oh.
m_ex_goldenship_04_2,I just remembered something.
m_ex_goldenship_04_3,"How have you been lately, Mast?"
m_ex_goldenship_04_4,??
m_ex_goldenship_04_5,What do you mean?
m_ex_goldenship_04_6,You know as well as I do that
m_ex_goldenship_04_7,"if you don't find treasure,"
m_ex_goldenship_04_8,you'll be in the poorhouse.
m_ex_goldenship_04_9,"Right, I totally forgot about that!"
m_ex_goldenship_04_10,!!
m_ex_goldenship_04_11,Savings all gone?
m_ex_goldenship_04_12,Ouch.
m_ex_goldenship_04_13,"I already told you before, I didn't lose everything."
m_ex_goldenship_04_14,I've still got a little bit left.
m_ex_goldenship_04_15,"Give me a little credit, you guys."
m_ex_goldenship_04_16,...
m_ex_goldenship_04_17,...
m_ex_goldenship_04_18,...
m_ex_goldenship_04_19,What's gotten into everybody?
m_ex_goldenship_04_20,"Well, it's just that..."
m_ex_goldenship_04_21,What?!
m_ex_goldenship_04_22,Have you been subsisting on leftovers from the boat parties?
m_ex_goldenship_04_23,...
m_ex_goldenship_04_24,"It almost got to that point,"
m_ex_goldenship_04_25,"but thankfully,"
m_ex_goldenship_04_26,Helm helped me out a little.
m_ex_goldenship_04_27,How so?
m_ex_goldenship_04_28,Hmm...
m_ex_goldenship_04_29,"In exchange for scrubbing the Admire every morning,"
m_ex_goldenship_04_30,I'll get a daily wage. Kinda like a part-time job.
m_ex_goldenship_04_31,!!!
m_ex_goldenship_04_32,How embarrassing.
m_ex_goldenship_04_33,I see.
m_ex_goldenship_04_34,So that's why
m_ex_goldenship_04_35,you've been cleaning every morning.
m_ex_goldenship_04_36,Yep.
m_ex_goldenship_04_37,Helm got me out of a tough spot.
m_ex_goldenship_04_38,Is Helm paying you out of her own pocket?
m_ex_goldenship_04_39,Yeah.
m_ex_goldenship_04_40,That's right.
m_ex_goldenship_04_41,She's nice.
m_ex_goldenship_04_42,"Yeah,"
m_ex_goldenship_04_43,that's super cool of her.
m_ex_goldenship_04_44,You should be nice to Helm in return.
m_ex_goldenship_04_45,"Trust me, I know."
m_ex_goldenship_04_46,So
m_ex_goldenship_04_47,I'm making sure the Admire is spick and span.
m_ex_goldenship_04_48,"Speaking of which, I've gotta go clean this baby up."
m_ex_goldenship_04_49,Good luck.
m_ex_goldenship_04_50,Good luck.
m_ex_goldenship_04_51,What they said.
m_ex_goldenship_05_1,Captain!
m_ex_goldenship_05_2,Frima!
m_ex_goldenship_05_3,??
m_ex_goldenship_05_4,?
m_ex_goldenship_05_5,Do you guys wanna pop open the golden elixir
m_ex_goldenship_05_6,tonight for dinner?
m_ex_goldenship_05_7,Ooh!
m_ex_goldenship_05_8,Sure.
m_ex_goldenship_05_9,Sounds good to me.
m_ex_goldenship_05_10,Where should we meet?
m_ex_goldenship_05_11,Hmm...
m_ex_goldenship_05_12,"It'd probably be easiest to meet at the Outpost,"
m_ex_goldenship_05_13,since that's where the Captain is.
m_ex_goldenship_05_14,"No, there're too many people here."
m_ex_goldenship_05_15,Hmm...
m_ex_goldenship_05_16,You're right.
m_ex_goldenship_05_17,There are a lot of Nikkes at the Outpost.
m_ex_goldenship_05_18,"If word got out that we had such a delectable brew on our hands, it'd be gone in an instant."
m_ex_goldenship_05_19,Let me think...
m_ex_goldenship_05_20,Where else would be a good spot?
m_ex_goldenship_05_21,How about Cafe Sweety?
m_ex_goldenship_05_22,How about the Admire?
m_ex_goldenship_05_23,No.
m_ex_goldenship_05_24,No way.
m_ex_goldenship_05_25,Sugar and Milk here.
m_ex_goldenship_05_26,Noooo.
m_ex_goldenship_05_27,"Okay then, how about the Admire?"
m_ex_goldenship_05_28,Yes!
m_ex_goldenship_05_29,That's a great idea!
m_ex_goldenship_05_30,Why didn't I think of that?
m_ex_goldenship_05_31,"Today's event is gonna wrap up early,"
m_ex_goldenship_05_32,so Helm and I will be the only ones on the entire ship.
m_ex_goldenship_05_33,"All right, then we'll drink on the Admire."
m_ex_goldenship_05_34,OK.
m_ex_goldenship_05_35,"This is great, I don't have to go anywhere."
m_ex_goldenship_05_36,Also
m_ex_goldenship_05_37,Hmm
m_ex_goldenship_05_38,"if everyone's okay with it,"
m_ex_goldenship_05_39,I'd like to
m_ex_goldenship_05_40,share some of the elixir
m_ex_goldenship_05_41,with Helm.
m_ex_goldenship_05_42,She's done a lot for me.
m_ex_goldenship_05_43,I'm fine with that.
m_ex_goldenship_05_44,"I knew you'd be okay with it, Anchor."
m_ex_goldenship_05_45,Okay.
m_ex_goldenship_05_46,Are you sure?
m_ex_goldenship_05_47,Yeah.
m_ex_goldenship_05_48,I'm surprised.
m_ex_goldenship_05_49,I thought you said you're not fond of sharing?
m_ex_goldenship_05_50,"Sugar and Milk, no."
m_ex_goldenship_05_51,"Others, okay."
m_ex_goldenship_05_52,Ha!
m_ex_goldenship_05_53,Lol
m_ex_goldenship_05_54,Hehehe.
m_ex_goldenship_05_55,I'm okay with it as well.
m_ex_goldenship_05_56,Haha!
m_ex_goldenship_05_57,You guys are so generous!
m_ex_goldenship_05_58,You've all got hearts as big as the ocean.
m_ex_goldenship_05_59,"Thanks a bunch, everyone."
m_ex_goldenship_05_60,I'll see you all later.
m_ex_goldenship_05_61,I'll try and snag some scrumptious snacks.
m_ex_goldenship_05_62,Awesome!
m_ex_goldenship_05_63,See you guys tonight.
m_ex_aegis_01_1,"Everyone, listen up."
m_ex_aegis_01_2,There are a total of four events scheduled next week:
m_ex_aegis_01_3,Monday: Royal Road charity function
m_ex_aegis_01_4,Tuesday: Talentum VIP event
m_ex_aegis_01_5,Thursday: Central Government high-ranking officials fellowship gathering
m_ex_aegis_01_6,Saturday: M.M.R. energy sector performance conference
m_ex_aegis_01_7,"Don't forget, and make sure you're well prepared."
m_ex_aegis_01_8,"Aw man,"
m_ex_aegis_01_9,I'm not even gonna have time to watch any movies next week.
m_ex_aegis_01_10,No way...
m_ex_aegis_01_11,That's a packed schedule.
m_ex_aegis_01_12,Nothing we can do about that.
m_ex_aegis_01_13,"In order to raise enough money to maintain the Admire,"
m_ex_aegis_01_14,we have no choice but to accept all the reservations that come our way.
m_ex_aegis_01_15,I'm surprised to see Talentum on the list.
m_ex_aegis_01_16,Why would M.M.R. hold a conference here of all places?
m_ex_aegis_01_17,I'd have reservations about hosting a government function filled with the top brass.
m_ex_aegis_01_18,Hm.
m_ex_aegis_01_19,The Admire is one of the most luxurious venues
m_ex_aegis_01_20,in the Ark where you can host a gathering.
m_ex_aegis_01_21,They often make reservations here
m_ex_aegis_01_22,to give their guests the full VIP treatment.
m_ex_aegis_01_23,The guests have always spoken highly of the events held here.
m_ex_aegis_01_24,Beats me.
m_ex_aegis_01_25,"Their researchers could be under a lot of stress,"
m_ex_aegis_01_26,"and the company has plenty of money to throw around,"
m_ex_aegis_01_27,so they don't mind splurging a bit.
m_ex_aegis_01_28,The fact that they're holding a supposedly work-based event on the weekend
m_ex_aegis_01_29,tells me they don't intend on actually getting much work done.
m_ex_aegis_01_30,We'll have to play it by ear.
m_ex_aegis_01_31,"Even within the Central Government itself, there are various subdivisions of official and unofficial factions."
m_ex_aegis_01_32,You should listen to the conversations they have as they're making their toasts.
m_ex_aegis_01_33,People's entire lives are being made or broken on a whim.
m_ex_aegis_01_34,"I try to keep my distance,"
m_ex_aegis_01_35,"but we're in desperate need of donations, so my hands are tied."
m_ex_aegis_01_36,Ugh!
m_ex_aegis_01_37,There are too many events.
m_ex_aegis_01_38,We need more people on staff.
m_ex_aegis_01_39,Why can't we recruit more squad members? @Helm
m_ex_aegis_01_40,Keep dreaming.
m_ex_aegis_01_41,We're already barely keeping our heads above water.
m_ex_aegis_01_42,"If we expanded the team,"
m_ex_aegis_01_43,"we'd have to factor in additional costs for their room and board, and any potential repairs."
m_ex_aegis_01_44,I'm inclined to agree.
m_ex_aegis_01_45,"Unless it's someone who could really benefit the team,"
m_ex_aegis_01_46,it simply wouldn't be worth the additional expenses.
m_ex_aegis_01_47,Wait a second...
m_ex_aegis_01_48,Are you all...
m_ex_aegis_01_49,Thinking what I'm thinking?
m_ex_aegis_01_50,??
m_ex_aegis_01_51,We've got the perfect candidate right in front of us.
m_ex_aegis_01_52,I just remembered as well:
m_ex_aegis_01_53,you've got a decent chunk of free time
m_ex_aegis_01_54,"until your next assignment, isn't that right Captain?"
m_ex_aegis_01_55,Oooh!
m_ex_aegis_01_56,It's like it's meant to be!
m_ex_aegis_01_57,Hold on a second.
m_ex_aegis_01_58,I hate to recruit someone
m_ex_aegis_01_59,"who is set to have some vacation time,"
m_ex_aegis_01_60,but I think you coming here
m_ex_aegis_01_61,would really boost morale.
m_ex_aegis_01_62,Do you think you could stop by sometime next week?
m_ex_aegis_01_63,It doesn't matter which day.
m_ex_aegis_01_64,...
m_ex_aegis_01_65,Captain!
m_ex_aegis_01_66,Captain!!
m_ex_aegis_01_67,Helm: Subordinate!!!
m_ex_aegis_01_68,... Fine.
m_ex_aegis_01_69,We did it!
m_ex_aegis_01_70,"But I'm telling you, I really can't on Thursday."
m_ex_aegis_01_71,Thursday?
m_ex_aegis_01_72,Thursday: Central Government high-ranking officials fellowship gathering
m_ex_aegis_01_73,You mean this day?
m_ex_aegis_01_74,"Ah,"
m_ex_aegis_01_75,understood.
m_ex_aegis_01_76,We're already asking a lot of you to help us out.
m_ex_aegis_01_77,To have you do menial labor in front of your superiors is a big ask.
m_ex_aegis_01_78,"Very well, then if you could come on any of the other three days, it'd be greatly appreciated."
m_ex_aegis_01_79,I should also mention that
m_ex_aegis_01_80,we wouldn't ask you to do this without some kind of remuneration.
m_ex_aegis_01_81,The quality of the food served at these events is exceptional.
m_ex_aegis_01_82,Then I'll be sure to attend.
m_ex_aegis_01_83,"If possible, I should try to go to Talentum's event, since there will at least be some familiar faces."
m_ex_aegis_02_1,"Check it out, guys."
m_ex_aegis_02_2,Elysion developed a new high-tech radar.
m_ex_aegis_02_3,elysionnl.com/news/article=4938203
m_ex_aegis_02_4,Uh-oh.
m_ex_aegis_02_5,"Anchor,"
m_ex_aegis_02_6,does this mean you're out of a job?
m_ex_aegis_02_7,?
m_ex_aegis_02_8,Why would that be the case?
m_ex_aegis_02_9,Isn't having a radar like... your thing?
m_ex_aegis_02_10,"If this fancy new radar can outperform you,"
m_ex_aegis_02_11,wouldn't that make you obsolete?
m_ex_aegis_02_12,They could end up outfitting the Admire
m_ex_aegis_02_13,with one of these new radars and giving you the boot.
m_ex_aegis_02_14,No.
m_ex_aegis_02_15,I won't allow that to happen.
m_ex_aegis_02_16,There's more to Anchor than her radar.
m_ex_aegis_02_17,She's a member of the Aegis Squad.
m_ex_aegis_02_18,She's not someone who can be so easily replaced.
m_ex_aegis_02_19,Wow!
m_ex_aegis_02_20,I'm so touched...
m_ex_aegis_02_21,I can't believe my ears.
m_ex_aegis_02_22,I never thought I'd live to see the day
m_ex_aegis_02_23,when Helm would speak so endearingly of one of her squadmates.
m_ex_aegis_02_24,This feels awesome.
m_ex_aegis_02_25,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_aegis_02_26,don't act like this is our problem alone.
m_ex_aegis_02_27,You have a personal connection with Ingrid.
m_ex_aegis_02_28,"If this situation were to ever come to pass,"
m_ex_aegis_02_29,surely you'd be able to help
m_ex_aegis_02_30,grease the wheels a bit?
m_ex_aegis_02_31,Grease the wheels?!
m_ex_aegis_02_32,So now we're resorting to bribery?
m_ex_aegis_02_33,Helm.
m_ex_aegis_02_34,"I thought you were against that kind of stuff, Helm."
m_ex_aegis_02_35,Of course I am.
m_ex_aegis_02_36,But the Aegis Squad cannot stand divided.
m_ex_aegis_02_37,If greasing some palms
m_ex_aegis_02_38,"is what it takes to keep us together,"
m_ex_aegis_02_39,then that's something I'm willing to do.
m_ex_aegis_02_40,I'll have a talk with Ingrid.
m_ex_aegis_02_41,I call Ingrid and speak to her about the latest radar technology.
m_ex_aegis_02_42,"Okay, done."
m_ex_aegis_02_43,You contacted her?
m_ex_aegis_02_44,What'd she say?
m_ex_aegis_02_45,The radar that was on the news isn't a military-grade radar like Anchor's.
m_ex_aegis_02_46,Hm.
m_ex_aegis_02_47,Apparently it's meant to detect certain resources only.
m_ex_aegis_02_48,I see.
m_ex_aegis_02_49,Thank goodness.
m_ex_aegis_02_50,That's a relief.
m_ex_aegis_02_51,"We got ourselves worked up over nothing, hehe."
m_ex_aegis_02_52,"Still,"
m_ex_aegis_02_53,"that was a heartwarming display of solidarity for your fellow squadmates, Helm."
m_ex_aegis_02_54,"Yeah, totally!"
m_ex_aegis_02_55,"You've really been keeping our noses to the grindstone these few days,"
m_ex_aegis_02_56,so I thought you weren't too fond of us.
m_ex_aegis_02_57,I guess I had it all wrong.
m_ex_aegis_02_58,I'm touched.
m_ex_aegis_02_59,How come Helm isn't reading her messages all of a sudden?
m_ex_aegis_02_60,"You don't think it's 'cause she's embarrassed, is it?"
m_ex_aegis_02_61,Helm? Are you there?
m_ex_aegis_02_62,Helm is no longer replying.
m_ex_aegis_03_1,Attention!
m_ex_aegis_03_2,"Attention, everyone!"
m_ex_aegis_03_3,"Summer has officially arrived,"
m_ex_aegis_03_4,and that means it's time to go swimming and check out some marine life.
m_ex_aegis_03_5,Who wants to go swimming?
m_ex_aegis_03_6,I'll go.
m_ex_aegis_03_7,"Okay, Mast and I make two."
m_ex_aegis_03_8,When?
m_ex_aegis_03_9,"Sometime next week, maybe?"
m_ex_aegis_03_10,We can put it to a vote.
m_ex_aegis_03_11,"If possible, let's aim for the weekend."
m_ex_aegis_03_12,Sure.
m_ex_aegis_03_13,It'd be hard for us to swing it on a weekday as well.
m_ex_aegis_03_14,How about Saturday?
m_ex_aegis_03_15,Don't we have an event on the Admire that day?
m_ex_aegis_03_16,"Okay, Sunday then."
m_ex_aegis_03_17,Count me in.
m_ex_aegis_03_18,That's three.
m_ex_aegis_03_19,Only one more person to make a full house.
m_ex_aegis_03_20,I'm looking at you Helm.
m_ex_aegis_03_21,I can't.
m_ex_aegis_03_22,Why not?
m_ex_aegis_03_23,I don't want to wear a swimsuit unless it's absolutely necessary.
m_ex_aegis_03_24,Are you that against wearing one?
m_ex_aegis_03_25,Yes.
m_ex_aegis_03_26,Why?
m_ex_aegis_03_27,Must I explain everything to you?
m_ex_aegis_03_28,"If you don't want to say it out loud, you could send out a radio signal."
m_ex_aegis_03_29,That's not what I mean!
m_ex_aegis_03_30,"If I'm understanding this situation correctly,"
m_ex_aegis_03_31,I think Helm is a wee bit embarrassed about donning a swimsuit again.
m_ex_aegis_03_32,"If you're a seasoned seafaring gent, then showing a little skin shouldn't be something that worries you."
m_ex_aegis_03_33,I'm not a man!
m_ex_aegis_03_34,It doesn't matter what gender you are!
m_ex_aegis_03_35,The most important thing to a pirate is harboring a scorching passion that burns deep within your heart.
m_ex_aegis_03_36,How many times do I have to remind you that we're not pirates? We are members of the navy.
m_ex_aegis_03_37,I'm a little disappointed.
m_ex_aegis_03_38,Why's that?
m_ex_aegis_03_39,"I don't want you to feel embarrassed of your body because of a swimsuit, Helm. You're beautiful either way."
m_ex_aegis_03_40,"I'm not refusing outright,"
m_ex_aegis_03_41,I'm just
m_ex_aegis_03_42,Oooh!
m_ex_aegis_03_43,So there's still hope yet.
m_ex_aegis_03_44,What a twist!
m_ex_aegis_03_45,So it's not necessarily a hard pass from you?
m_ex_aegis_03_46,I'm glad to hear that.
m_ex_aegis_03_47,"What about me, Captain?"
m_ex_aegis_03_48,How do I look?
m_ex_aegis_03_49,"If you ask me, I think this swimsuit is sexy and sultry,"
m_ex_aegis_03_50,while also having a bit of pirate flair to it.
m_ex_aegis_03_51,The pirate logo on the top is quite memorable.
m_ex_aegis_03_52,"It's both cute, yet sophisticated."
m_ex_aegis_03_53,Thanks!
m_ex_aegis_03_54,It's always nice to hear a compliment.
m_ex_aegis_03_55,I knew I wouldn't be the only one who liked it.
m_ex_aegis_03_56,"So,"
m_ex_aegis_03_57,"next Sunday, right?"
m_ex_aegis_03_58,"Just don't flake on me, Subordinate."
m_ex_aegis_03_59,"Otherwise, there's no point in me wearing a swimsuit."
m_ex_aegis_03_60,"No, what I mean is"
m_ex_aegis_03_61,"since we all promised to go, no one should bow out now..."
m_ex_aegis_03_62,"All right, I'll be sure to be there."
m_ex_aegis_04_1,Emergency!
m_ex_aegis_04_2,What's wrong?
m_ex_aegis_04_3,My Star Starfish
m_ex_aegis_04_4,has disappeared!
m_ex_aegis_04_5,When did you last see it?
m_ex_aegis_04_6,Star Starfish?
m_ex_aegis_04_7,Ah
m_ex_aegis_04_8,It's only the cutest
m_ex_aegis_04_9,of all the starfish!
m_ex_aegis_04_10,"It's got five legs,"
m_ex_aegis_04_11,with a blue base and orange polka dots.
m_ex_aegis_04_12,When did you last see it?
m_ex_aegis_04_13,"In Helm's office, I think?"
m_ex_aegis_04_14,I went in to report that I was done with my cleaning.
m_ex_aegis_04_15,That must have been when it escaped from its box.
m_ex_aegis_04_16,Excuse me?
m_ex_aegis_04_17,Oh my!
m_ex_aegis_04_18,That means it must be wriggling around Helm's feet right about now.
m_ex_aegis_04_19,!!!
m_ex_aegis_04_20,Wait a moment.
m_ex_aegis_04_21,Let me look.
m_ex_aegis_04_22,AGH!
m_ex_aegis_04_23,?
m_ex_aegis_04_24,Helm doesn't send any further messages for a while.
m_ex_aegis_04_25,Someone.
m_ex_aegis_04_26,Please.
m_ex_aegis_04_27,Come here.
m_ex_aegis_04_28,I think I feel something squirming underneath my foot.
m_ex_aegis_04_29,??
m_ex_aegis_04_30,Now's not really a good time for me.
m_ex_aegis_04_31,"I'm in the middle of doing a repair on the Admire,"
m_ex_aegis_04_32,and some high-ranking official wants me to explain something to them.
m_ex_aegis_04_33,Anchor?
m_ex_aegis_04_34,"I'm on my way, box in tow."
m_ex_aegis_04_35,But I wandered off quite the distance while searching for the starfish.
m_ex_aegis_04_36,I'm probably 20 minutes out.
m_ex_aegis_04_37,You'll have to keep an eye on the starfish in the meantime
m_ex_aegis_04_38,and make sure it doesn't run off anywhere.
m_ex_aegis_04_39,"Oh, and by the way,"
m_ex_aegis_04_40,"starfish can die if they dry up,"
m_ex_aegis_04_41,so be sure to spritz it with some water.
m_ex_aegis_04_42,What?
m_ex_aegis_04_43,You expect me to watch this thing for 20 minutes?
m_ex_aegis_04_44,"Not only that, but I'm expected to spray it with water, which is bound to make it squirm around even more."
m_ex_aegis_04_45,You must be dreaming.
m_ex_aegis_04_46,Subordinate.
m_ex_aegis_04_47,Can you
m_ex_aegis_04_48,I'd love to help...
m_ex_aegis_04_49,come over here?
m_ex_aegis_04_50,I just got roped into a meeting.
m_ex_aegis_04_51,Oh.
m_ex_aegis_04_52,"Helm,"
m_ex_aegis_04_53,"if you find being in the company of a starfish that unpleasant,"
m_ex_aegis_04_54,just try repeating positive thoughts in your mind.
m_ex_aegis_04_55,Tell yourself that it's your friend.
m_ex_aegis_04_56,No!
m_ex_aegis_04_57,I can't!
m_ex_aegis_04_58,"I'm going to stand on top of my desk chair until you get here,"
m_ex_aegis_04_59,so hurry up and get this thing out of here.
m_ex_aegis_04_60,?!
m_ex_aegis_04_61,"Even if I really book it, the fastest I can get there is in 15 minutes."
m_ex_aegis_04_62,"I don't care, just hurry up and get here!"
m_ex_aegis_04_63,I hope everything gets resolved. Keep me updated.
m_ex_marciana_01_1,Hello Commander.
m_ex_marciana_01_2,My name is Marciana. I'm a teacher at the M.M.R. Vocational School.
m_ex_marciana_01_3,Looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_marciana_01_4,Likewise.
m_ex_marciana_01_5,Okay.
m_ex_marciana_01_6,...
m_ex_marciana_01_7,???
m_ex_marciana_01_8,"I've seen a lot of students use Bla,"
m_ex_marciana_01_9,but this is my first time using it to chat with someone.
m_ex_marciana_01_10,...
m_ex_marciana_01_11,I'm not entirely sure what to say.
m_ex_marciana_01_12,What kind of conversations do you usually have on here?
m_ex_marciana_01_13,We can talk about anything you like.
m_ex_marciana_01_14,We can talk about your day.
m_ex_marciana_01_15,What do I like...
m_ex_marciana_01_16,Like what I do on a daily basis?
m_ex_marciana_01_17,...
m_ex_marciana_01_18,There is no reply from Marciana for a while.
m_ex_marciana_01_19,Bla is tougher to use than I thought.
m_ex_marciana_01_20,Just relax and say whatever comes to mind.
m_ex_marciana_01_21,If that's the case...
m_ex_marciana_01_22,There is no reply from Marciana for a while.
m_ex_marciana_01_23,Would it be okay for me to talk about my student?
m_ex_marciana_01_24,Of course.
m_ex_marciana_01_25,Rei gave me some chocolate after class today.
m_ex_marciana_01_26,That's sweet.
m_ex_marciana_01_27,Isn't it?
m_ex_marciana_01_28,She was very keen on pointing out that she'd gotten me heart-shaped ones.
m_ex_marciana_01_29,...
m_ex_marciana_01_30,"But, because she gave me so many, I couldn't eat them all."
m_ex_marciana_01_31,"I don't want to throw them away, but I don't know what to do with the rest of them."
m_ex_marciana_01_32,We could eat some of them together.
m_ex_marciana_01_33,...
m_ex_marciana_01_34,Right now?
m_ex_marciana_01_35,Why not? Are you busy?
m_ex_marciana_01_36,"Because of exam markings, my schedule is a bit tight at the moment."
m_ex_marciana_01_37,I don't think it is possible right now.
m_ex_marciana_01_38,Then let's meet when you're not busy.
m_ex_marciana_01_39,... Okay.
m_ex_marciana_01_40,I should be done in a few hours.
m_ex_marciana_02_1,"Heya, Commander!"
m_ex_marciana_02_2,... What's up?
m_ex_marciana_02_3,Nuthin.
m_ex_marciana_02_4,Is everything okay over there?
m_ex_marciana_02_5,Yeppers.
m_ex_marciana_02_6,"This is Marciana, right?"
m_ex_marciana_02_7,"Yeah, sure!"
m_ex_marciana_02_8,...
m_ex_marciana_02_9,"Is something wrong, Commander?"
m_ex_marciana_02_10,"There you are, Marciana."
m_ex_marciana_02_11,...?
m_ex_marciana_02_12,It was me the entire time.
m_ex_marciana_02_13,Is 'Heya' not a proper greeting?
m_ex_marciana_02_14,"It's not that, it's just..."
m_ex_marciana_02_15,"Okay, good."
m_ex_marciana_02_16,"The last time I spoke to you on Bla,"
m_ex_marciana_02_17,"you used that expression, and it was unfamiliar to me."
m_ex_marciana_02_18,"So, I had Ein teach me some new slangs today."
m_ex_marciana_02_19,"Of which ""Heya"" was one."
m_ex_marciana_02_20,"""Heya"" is just short for ""hey you""."
m_ex_marciana_02_21,... Huh?
m_ex_marciana_02_22,There is no reply from Marciana for a while. She might be searching for the proper linguistic term to utilize.
m_ex_marciana_02_23,Sorry.
m_ex_marciana_02_24,I've made a mistake.
m_ex_marciana_02_25,"Nah, it's fine. I use that kind of slang all the time."
m_ex_marciana_02_26,...
m_ex_marciana_02_27,"Sure, but all I did was making you confused."
m_ex_marciana_02_28,Only because you sounded totally different from your usual self.
m_ex_marciana_02_29,"I was a bit caught off guard, but it wasn't what I'd call unpleasant."
m_ex_marciana_02_30,...
m_ex_marciana_02_31,So you thought I was someone else...
m_ex_marciana_02_32,Hmm?
m_ex_marciana_02_33,...
m_ex_marciana_02_34,"Again, there is no reply from Marciana for a while."
m_ex_marciana_02_35,"Going forward, I'll be more judicious about what I learn from Ein."
m_ex_marciana_02_36,"It's okay, honestly. It felt more casual with you using slang."
m_ex_marciana_02_37,Really?
m_ex_marciana_02_38,Totally.
m_ex_marciana_02_39,Well...
m_ex_marciana_02_40,I'm glad to hear that.
m_ex_marciana_02_41,"Still, I think I'll refrain from using it too much."
m_ex_marciana_02_42,Too bad...
m_ex_marciana_02_43,Zwei says she has a question she wants to ask me.
m_ex_marciana_02_44,"Okay, since we're signing off for the day, you should say ""deuces""."
m_ex_marciana_02_45,...
m_ex_marciana_02_46,"Come on, say it."
m_ex_marciana_02_47,...
m_ex_marciana_02_48,"... I'll be in touch, Commander."
m_ex_marciana_02_49,Deuces!
m_ex_marciana_02_50,...
m_ex_marciana_02_51,... Deuces.
m_ex_marciana_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_marciana_03_2,I heard that you'd be filling in as a substitute teacher?
m_ex_marciana_03_3,"The joint assessment is going to be held twice,"
m_ex_marciana_03_4,with the final score being the average of the two scores put together.
m_ex_marciana_03_5,"I wasn't sure if you'd been informed of this,"
m_ex_marciana_03_6,but I figured I'd send you a bla just to make sure you're aware.
m_ex_marciana_03_7,Thanks for letting me know.
m_ex_marciana_03_8,No problem. I'll see you soon.
m_ex_marciana_03_9,See you.
m_ex_marciana_03_10,Lovely Sweets magazine issue #7 pre-ordered.
m_ex_marciana_03_11,Only Animals magazine issue #3 ordered.
m_ex_marciana_03_12,Cutie Dolls limited-edition issue ordered.
m_ex_marciana_03_13,???
m_ex_marciana_03_14,There is no reply from Marciana for a while.
m_ex_marciana_03_15,...
m_ex_marciana_03_16,"Sorry, those were sent to you by accident."
m_ex_marciana_03_17,It would appear my Bla account is linked to my tablet.
m_ex_marciana_03_18,Don't get any wrong ideas.
m_ex_marciana_03_19,"I'm a teacher, and these purchases are purely for research purposes."
m_ex_marciana_03_20,To help me analyze the interests of my students.
m_ex_marciana_03_21,What are they?
m_ex_marciana_03_22,"One is a magazine on desserts, another on animals, and the other on dolls."
m_ex_marciana_03_23,...
m_ex_marciana_03_24,I like all of those things.
m_ex_marciana_03_25,... What?
m_ex_marciana_03_26,They're all super cute.
m_ex_marciana_03_27,So you like cute things?
m_ex_marciana_03_28,Most definitely.
m_ex_marciana_03_29,"Again, there is no reply from Marciana for a while."
m_ex_marciana_03_30,Lately...
m_ex_marciana_03_31,Cute desserts have been all the rage amongst the students.
m_ex_marciana_03_32,"Come to think of it, a new dessert just came out at the Maid Cafe."
m_ex_marciana_03_33,Desserts are my weakness. I'm powerless to resist them.
m_ex_marciana_03_34,Maid Cafe?
m_ex_marciana_03_35,The one where Cocoa works?
m_ex_marciana_03_36,"Yep, that's the place."
m_ex_marciana_03_37,What do you know about cute desserts in particular?
m_ex_marciana_03_38,I know a bit.
m_ex_marciana_03_39,"Like, say, the new strawberry cat crepe?"
m_ex_marciana_03_40,I'm drooling just hearing you say the name.
m_ex_marciana_03_41,...
m_ex_marciana_03_42,Sounds to me like we should have a dessert date.
m_ex_marciana_03_43,What?
m_ex_marciana_03_44,But...
m_ex_marciana_03_45,"If you want to understand what the students are into, wouldn't it be best for you to have first-hand experience?"
m_ex_marciana_03_46,...
m_ex_marciana_03_47,"Again, there is no reply from Marciana for a while."
m_ex_marciana_03_48,You have a point.
m_ex_marciana_03_49,"All right,"
m_ex_marciana_03_50,we can meet up to have some dessert.
m_ex_marciana_03_51,It's a date.
m_ex_marciana_03_52,... Sounds good.
m_ex_tia_01_1,Hello Teacher!
m_ex_tia_01_2,"Omg omg, I finally get to talk with you on Bla!"
m_ex_tia_01_3,So exciting♥
m_ex_tia_01_4,"Sorry,"
m_ex_tia_01_5,I know that I'm talking too much already♥
m_ex_tia_01_6,Allow me to introduce myself.
m_ex_tia_01_7,"I'm currently attending the M.M.R. vocational school,"
m_ex_tia_01_8,and I'm part of the Dazzling Pearl squad.
m_ex_tia_01_9,I'm the oldest
m_ex_tia_01_10,of the
m_ex_tia_01_11,older
m_ex_tia_01_12,students.
m_ex_tia_01_13,♥
m_ex_tia_01_14,Although Naga probably wouldn't like me saying that.
m_ex_tia_01_15,"She doesn't like being referred to as old in any way, shape or form."
m_ex_tia_01_16,"To put it another way,"
m_ex_tia_01_17,she and I are members of the graduating class.
m_ex_tia_01_18,"Anyhoo,"
m_ex_tia_01_19,you've gotta keep all this business
m_ex_tia_01_20,"about me using the word ""old"""
m_ex_tia_01_21,"a secret from Naga,"
m_ex_tia_01_22,okay?
m_ex_tia_01_23,Sure thing.
m_ex_tia_01_24,Are we already keeping secrets? How exciting♥
m_ex_tia_01_25,Hehe!
m_ex_tia_01_26,Teacher!
m_ex_tia_01_27,I'm so happy
m_ex_tia_01_28,that you replied
m_ex_tia_01_29,to me!
m_ex_tia_01_30,We should chat here more often♥
m_ex_tia_01_31,"Ha,"
m_ex_tia_01_32,"you're so cute, Teacher."
m_ex_tia_01_33,It's too bad you're not here.
m_ex_tia_01_34,"If you were,"
m_ex_tia_01_35,I'd give you a great big hug
m_ex_tia_01_36,and never let go♥
m_ex_tia_01_37,"However,"
m_ex_tia_01_38,I think
m_ex_tia_01_39,I just
m_ex_tia_01_40,got caught...
m_ex_tia_01_41,What do you mean?
m_ex_tia_01_42,"Actually,"
m_ex_tia_01_43,class
m_ex_tia_01_44,"just started,"
m_ex_tia_01_45,and I'm
m_ex_tia_01_46,texting you
m_ex_tia_01_47,on the sly.
m_ex_tia_01_48,Emm...
m_ex_tia_01_49,Hehe...
m_ex_tia_01_50,"If you're in class, you don't have to reply to my messages."
m_ex_tia_01_51,But
m_ex_tia_01_52,I want to
m_ex_tia_01_53,keep talking to y
m_ex_tia_01_54,Tia?
m_ex_tia_01_55,There are no further messages from Tia.
m_ex_tia_02_1,Teacher♥
m_ex_tia_02_2,Teacherteacherteacher♥
m_ex_tia_02_3,I'm really
m_ex_tia_02_4,craving something sweet
m_ex_tia_02_5,today.
m_ex_tia_02_6,Like a macaron.
m_ex_tia_02_7,Or some pie.
m_ex_tia_02_8,Or a tart.
m_ex_tia_02_9,Or even eclairs or something similar.
m_ex_tia_02_10,Do you want to go to a cafe?
m_ex_tia_02_11,"You always know what to say,"
m_ex_tia_02_12,Teacher♥
m_ex_tia_02_13,That's exactly the answer I wanted to hear♥
m_ex_tia_02_14,I actually
m_ex_tia_02_15,received an invitation
m_ex_tia_02_16,to a newly opened cafe.
m_ex_tia_02_17,"Since they're a new restaurant,"
m_ex_tia_02_18,their dessert menu is all brand new as well.
m_ex_tia_02_19,They've asked me to come and do some a tasting
m_ex_tia_02_20,and leave a review.
m_ex_tia_02_21,You know my social media account
m_ex_tia_02_22,where I talk about desserts?
m_ex_tia_02_23,I think that's why they invited me.
m_ex_tia_02_24,I didn't know you had a social media account.
m_ex_tia_02_25,How could I not know it? It's a super popular page.
m_ex_tia_02_26,"Yeah, hehe."
m_ex_tia_02_27,"I started it as a hobby,"
m_ex_tia_02_28,but it's grown quite a bit
m_ex_tia_02_29,and now I've got a healthy amount of followers.
m_ex_tia_02_30,You've gotta promise to follow me♥
m_ex_tia_02_31,!!!
m_ex_tia_02_32,Really?
m_ex_tia_02_33,You already knew about my social media account?
m_ex_tia_02_34,Of course.
m_ex_tia_02_35,Oh my gosh!
m_ex_tia_02_36,I'm so touched♥
m_ex_tia_02_37,"Anyways,"
m_ex_tia_02_38,would you like to
m_ex_tia_02_39,go together?
m_ex_tia_02_40,What's in it for me?
m_ex_tia_02_41,Hmm...
m_ex_tia_02_42,"A surfeit of sweet desserts,"
m_ex_tia_02_43,"freshly brewed coffee,"
m_ex_tia_02_44,A...
m_ex_tia_02_45,N...
m_ex_tia_02_46,D...
m_ex_tia_02_47,And?
m_ex_tia_02_48,A chance to
m_ex_tia_02_49,spend the entire day
m_ex_tia_02_50,with me♥
m_ex_tia_02_51,Hehehe...
m_ex_tia_02_52,Hehehehehehe♥
m_ex_tia_02_53,"Er, actually..."
m_ex_tia_02_54,It's a bit embarrassing when I say that out loud♥
m_ex_tia_02_55,"But then again, it also feels invigorating♥"
m_ex_tia_02_56,"Well, are you coming, Teacher?"
m_ex_tia_02_57,Let's go.
m_ex_tia_02_58,"Sorry, I can't."
m_ex_tia_02_59,Woohoo!
m_ex_tia_02_60,"If you'd turned me down, I'd have been mortified."
m_ex_tia_02_61,I'd have probably gone and crawled under a hole♥
m_ex_tia_02_62,"Thanks, Teacher♥"
m_ex_tia_02_63,Huh?
m_ex_tia_02_64,You're not going?
m_ex_tia_02_65,"You're not serious, are you?"
m_ex_tia_02_66,"... No, it was just a typo."
m_ex_tia_02_67,"Phew, I thought so."
m_ex_tia_02_68,So
m_ex_tia_02_69,you're going?
m_ex_tia_02_70,Yes.
m_ex_tia_02_71,Thank goodness♥
m_ex_tia_02_72,"Thanks, Teacher!"
m_ex_tia_02_73,"See you soon, hehe!"
m_ex_tia_03_1,I got scolded
m_ex_tia_03_2,by Naga again.
m_ex_tia_03_3,Why?
m_ex_tia_03_4,"As soon as we met today,"
m_ex_tia_03_5,"I rushed over to her,"
m_ex_tia_03_6,hehe♥
m_ex_tia_03_7,Did you hug her?
m_ex_tia_03_8,Did you squeeze her cheeks?
m_ex_tia_03_9,Yep!
m_ex_tia_03_10,I wrapped my arms
m_ex_tia_03_11,around her
m_ex_tia_03_12,and squeeeeezed super tight.
m_ex_tia_03_13,It was a warm and loving hug♥
m_ex_tia_03_14,Yep!
m_ex_tia_03_15,"I got reaaaaalllly close,"
m_ex_tia_03_16,and pinched her chubby little cheeks.
m_ex_tia_03_17,They were so soft and squishy♥
m_ex_tia_03_18,"Once I did that,"
m_ex_tia_03_19,she gave me a real dressing down.
m_ex_tia_03_20,She remarked about
m_ex_tia_03_21,how I do the same thing to you each time we meet as well.
m_ex_tia_03_22,"I wonder how she knew about that, though?"
m_ex_tia_03_23,"Naga must have eyes on the back of her head,"
m_ex_tia_03_24,cause it feels like she knows everything.
m_ex_tia_03_25,Maybe she's always watching you.
m_ex_tia_03_26,Wow!
m_ex_tia_03_27,You think so?
m_ex_tia_03_28,If that's
m_ex_tia_03_29,"actually true,"
m_ex_tia_03_30,that'd be
m_ex_tia_03_31,amazing♥
m_ex_tia_03_32,It's like
m_ex_tia_03_33,I'm being protected all the time♥
m_ex_tia_03_34,"Pretty cool,"
m_ex_tia_03_35,hehe.
m_ex_tia_03_36,"If you think about it though,"
m_ex_tia_03_37,Naga is always near me already.
m_ex_tia_03_38,"Whenever I forget to do my homework,"
m_ex_tia_03_39,"she'll help me go over it,"
m_ex_tia_03_40,"and whenever I forget to put on my stockings,"
m_ex_tia_03_41,she'll remind me.
m_ex_tia_03_42,She even comes to pick me up
m_ex_tia_03_43,and take me out for lunch.
m_ex_tia_03_44,Sounds like she's your mom.
m_ex_tia_03_45,"Even a mother couldn't do everything she does,"
m_ex_tia_03_46,hehe.
m_ex_tia_03_47,That's why
m_ex_tia_03_48,Naga is the best!
m_ex_tia_03_49,"Of course,"
m_ex_tia_03_50,"after you, Teacher."
m_ex_tia_03_51,Hehe♥
m_ex_tia_03_52,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_tia_03_53,I get to see you today.
m_ex_tia_03_54,Can't wait to see you!
m_ex_tia_03_55,I'll come over as soon as class is over♥
m_ex_tia_03_56,Be sure to wait for me!
m_ex_naga_01_1,"Hello there, Teacher."
m_ex_naga_01_2,"Oh, sorry."
m_ex_naga_01_3,I should introduce myself first.
m_ex_naga_01_4,"I'm a student from the M.M.R. Vocational School,"
m_ex_naga_01_5,and you might know my classmate Tia.
m_ex_naga_01_6,"Also, I'm a member of Dazzling Pearl."
m_ex_naga_01_7,"I'm sure Tia has been quite a handful for you,"
m_ex_naga_01_8,but thanks for taking such good care of her.
m_ex_naga_01_9,Are you Tia's mother?
m_ex_naga_01_10,Don't mention it.
m_ex_naga_01_11,???
m_ex_naga_01_12,LOL
m_ex_naga_01_13,I hear that all the time.
m_ex_naga_01_14,"I mean, I do enjoy looking after Tia,"
m_ex_naga_01_15,but we're just friends.
m_ex_naga_01_16,To call me her mother would be a bit much.
m_ex_naga_01_17,My word!
m_ex_naga_01_18,"You certainly live up to your reputation, Teacher."
m_ex_naga_01_19,You're always so caring.
m_ex_naga_01_20,It's no wonder everyone is such a big fan of yours!
m_ex_naga_01_21,"Myself included, of course."
m_ex_naga_01_22,Hehe.
m_ex_naga_01_23,Gah!
m_ex_naga_01_24,KLJ!#rj11r3f
m_ex_naga_01_25,asl;dkfj130
m_ex_naga_01_26,ASDL;FKJ10
m_ex_naga_01_27,???
m_ex_naga_01_28,"Oh, sorry."
m_ex_naga_01_29,Tia wanted to look at my phone and pounced on me.
m_ex_naga_01_30,So I made some typos while trying to get her off me.
m_ex_naga_01_31,"Like you said, she's a real handful."
m_ex_naga_01_32,"She is, but it's okay."
m_ex_naga_01_33,I don't find it exhausting since
m_ex_naga_01_34,I'm happy being around her.
m_ex_naga_01_35,Tia is like family to me.
m_ex_naga_01_36,"If I didn't have her in my life, I'd feel empty inside."
m_ex_naga_01_37,"The same goes for you too,"
m_ex_naga_01_38,Teacher.
m_ex_naga_01_39,I hope we can meet more often in the future.
m_ex_naga_01_40,Hahahahaha!
m_ex_naga_01_41,Oh my!
m_ex_naga_01_42,There goes the school bell.
m_ex_naga_01_43,I guess it's time for class.
m_ex_naga_01_44,"Like they say, time flies when you're having fun!"
m_ex_naga_01_45,"Catch you later,"
m_ex_naga_01_46,Teacher.
m_ex_naga_02_1,"Teacher,"
m_ex_naga_02_2,have you ever considered getting your ears pierced?
m_ex_naga_02_3,Never.
m_ex_naga_02_4,That's too bad :(
m_ex_naga_02_5,What about a ring
m_ex_naga_02_6,or perhaps a bracelet?
m_ex_naga_02_7,"No, they'd probably just get in the way."
m_ex_naga_02_8,Hmm...
m_ex_naga_02_9,How about...
m_ex_naga_02_10,Necklaces?
m_ex_naga_02_11,Watches?
m_ex_naga_02_12,Keychains?
m_ex_naga_02_13,"No, they're not for me."
m_ex_naga_02_14,Oh... I see.
m_ex_naga_02_15,Why do you ask?
m_ex_naga_02_16,"Oh, it's nothing."
m_ex_naga_02_17,It's just that I found something in an alley today.
m_ex_naga_02_18,What?
m_ex_naga_02_19,"I saw a signless store that seemed rather suspicious,"
m_ex_naga_02_20,"but once I went inside, I noticed that there were loads of pretty things."
m_ex_naga_02_21,So I thought of getting one for you.
m_ex_naga_02_22,It's too bad you're not into that kind of thing.
m_ex_naga_02_23,What kind of store was it?
m_ex_naga_02_24,"Hehe, it's obviously an accessories shop!"
m_ex_naga_02_25,There were all sorts of cool stuff in there.
m_ex_naga_02_26,"Ugh, what should I do?"
m_ex_naga_02_27,"I was planning on saving up this month,"
m_ex_naga_02_28,but now I'm not so sure.
m_ex_naga_02_29,"When it comes to these things, you seem more like someone your age."
m_ex_naga_02_30,Eh?
m_ex_naga_02_31,Are you implying that
m_ex_naga_02_32,I'm not acting my age?
m_ex_naga_02_33,Is that
m_ex_naga_02_34,what you're saying?
m_ex_naga_02_35,I'm just saying you appear more mature than your actual age.
m_ex_naga_02_36,I'm just saying you appear younger than your actual age.
m_ex_naga_02_37,"Oh, Teacher,"
m_ex_naga_02_38,you've no idea what you've just done.
m_ex_naga_02_39,Your words will be etched in my memory forever.
m_ex_naga_02_40,"Oh, right."
m_ex_naga_02_41,That's what you meant.
m_ex_naga_02_42,I thought you had something else in mind.
m_ex_naga_02_43,"Thank you, Teacher! Hehe."
m_ex_naga_02_44,"Teacher,"
m_ex_naga_02_45,"I know that I've been in your hair as of late,"
m_ex_naga_02_46,so I'd like to give you a thank-you gift for everything you've done.
m_ex_naga_02_47,"You don't have to wear it,"
m_ex_naga_02_48,but I hope that you'll accept
m_ex_naga_02_49,a token of my gratitude.
m_ex_naga_02_50,"Of course, you can always get me a necklace."
m_ex_naga_02_51,"Of course, you can always get me a watch."
m_ex_naga_02_52,"I figured you'd say that,"
m_ex_naga_02_53,so I'll choose something that catches my eyes.
m_ex_naga_02_54,See you in the Commander's Room later
m_ex_naga_02_55,and brace yourself for a surprise when I arrive!
m_ex_naga_03_1,Teacher.
m_ex_naga_03_2,Did anything interesting happen to you today?
m_ex_naga_03_3,Not really.
m_ex_naga_03_4,I see...
m_ex_naga_03_5,What about you?
m_ex_naga_03_6,Just an ordinary day for me as well.
m_ex_naga_03_7,"Tia forgot her bow this morning,"
m_ex_naga_03_8,so I took out the spare one I had in my bag and tied it on her.
m_ex_naga_03_9,"At that point, I was just relieved that she had put on her stockings properly."
m_ex_naga_03_10,"Her hair was also a mess, so I brushed it for her."
m_ex_naga_03_11,"With just a few gentle strokes, Tia's hair transformed into a velvety cascade."
m_ex_naga_03_12,"After entering the classroom, I checked her homework,"
m_ex_naga_03_13,"and just like I thought, most of it was not done."
m_ex_naga_03_14,Can you believe it? She left 8 out of 10 questions unanswered!
m_ex_naga_03_15,Isn't she just adorable? Haha.
m_ex_naga_03_16,...
m_ex_naga_03_17,Absolutely adorable.
m_ex_naga_03_18,You should have seen her face
m_ex_naga_03_19,when I asked her to complete the questions before the lesson began.
m_ex_naga_03_20,"Then, she worked up a storm to get them all done."
m_ex_naga_03_21,"I mean, it's something that can be done quickly, yet it always slips her mind."
m_ex_naga_03_22,LOL
m_ex_naga_03_23,Oh yes!
m_ex_naga_03_24,"And every time she sits down at her desk,"
m_ex_naga_03_25,she'd sink into her seat like a blob of jelly.
m_ex_naga_03_26,"Although she insists that it's the most comfortable position for her,"
m_ex_naga_03_27,I'm sure it's bad for her body if she doesn't have a good posture.
m_ex_naga_03_28,That's why I'm always reprimanding her to sit up straight.
m_ex_naga_03_29,"Wow, every single time? That's really impressive!"
m_ex_naga_03_30,I also do it during my break time as a form of stretching. Hehe.
m_ex_naga_03_31,Oh!
m_ex_naga_03_32,Here's another intriguing tidbit about Tia.
m_ex_naga_03_33,"When it comes to desserts, she's the most punctual person you'll ever meet,"
m_ex_naga_03_34,"but whenever the lunch bell rings, she always acts like she can't hear it."
m_ex_naga_03_35,"So, I always end up"
m_ex_naga_03_36,making sure she has her lunch every day.
m_ex_naga_03_37,"Despite what she thinks, desserts are not a proper meal."
m_ex_naga_03_38,"However tempting they may be, they should not replace her regular meals."
m_ex_naga_03_39,"After all,"
m_ex_naga_03_40,we're students
m_ex_naga_03_41,and our growing bodies need proper nutrition.
m_ex_naga_03_42,Even if we are Nikkes. Hehe.
m_ex_naga_03_43,"Exactly, so don't forget to eat three square meals a day."
m_ex_naga_03_44,I won't!
m_ex_naga_03_45,"Oh,"
m_ex_naga_03_46,it's almost time for me to pass Tia her sportswear.
m_ex_naga_03_47,"Earlier, I noticed that"
m_ex_naga_03_48,she had left them in her bag.
m_ex_naga_03_49,"While I'm at it, I should help her tie her hair as well."
m_ex_naga_03_50,"Anyway, I'm off now!"
m_ex_naga_03_51,Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any exciting news to share!
m_ex_naga_03_52,Okay. See you later.
m_ex_naga_03_53,"It seems like Naga's day revolves around Tia, rather than herself..."
m_ex_quiry_01_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_quiry_01_2,Commander.
m_ex_quiry_01_3,This is Quiry.
m_ex_quiry_01_4,I see you have no problems typing.
m_ex_quiry_01_5,None at all!
m_ex_quiry_01_6,"Administrative work is my specialty, after all."
m_ex_quiry_01_7,I excel at all things paperwork.
m_ex_quiry_01_8,So you can read the letters just fine?
m_ex_quiry_01_9,Not exactly.
m_ex_quiry_01_10,"I know the keyboard layout by heart, so I can touch type."
m_ex_quiry_01_11,"It's not like the keys are gonna run off, right?"
m_ex_quiry_01_12,"Anyway, I can make them out as long as I squint hard enough."
m_ex_quiry_01_13,That's bad for your eyes.
m_ex_quiry_01_14,"I do it all day long,"
m_ex_quiry_01_15,so I'm used to it by now.
m_ex_quiry_01_16,"As compared to these,"
m_ex_quiry_01_17,I'm more worried about whether I can adapt well here.
m_ex_quiry_01_18,"Thanks to my poor eyesight, even navigating around is a challenge."
m_ex_quiry_01_19,"While on the Ark, I relied on memorizing the routes I frequently took,"
m_ex_quiry_01_20,so I can't imagine how many things I'm gonna end up breaking in the Outpost TT^TT
m_ex_quiry_01_21,So I'd like to apologize in advance.
m_ex_quiry_01_22,What does having poor eyesight have to do with breaking things?
m_ex_quiry_01_23,"Well, for example,"
m_ex_quiry_01_24,I'd mistake a protruding brick for a doorknob to yank
m_ex_quiry_01_25,"and cause the entire building to collapse,"
m_ex_quiry_01_26,or I'd confused the TV with a window
m_ex_quiry_01_27,and it's safe to say that the TV won't be working anymore.
m_ex_quiry_01_28,Things like that
m_ex_quiry_01_29,tend to happen all the time. Hehe.
m_ex_quiry_01_30,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_quiry_01_31,Yep yep. Hehe.
m_ex_quiry_01_32,So don't worry too much about it.
m_ex_quiry_01_33,Poli and Miranda said that they would try their best to help me.
m_ex_quiry_01_34,I'll help too.
m_ex_quiry_01_35,Really?
m_ex_quiry_01_36,That's very kind of you!
m_ex_quiry_01_37,Oh!
m_ex_quiry_01_38,"Poli is calling me, so I've got to go."
m_ex_quiry_01_39,I'll do my best to get used to the Outpost ASAP.
m_ex_quiry_01_40,Thank you in advance.
m_ex_quiry_01_41,You're welcome.
m_ex_quiry_01_42,See ya!
m_ex_quiry_02_1,Commander!
m_ex_quiry_02_2,It's happening!
m_ex_quiry_02_3,I was invited to a movie premiere!
m_ex_quiry_02_4,But they want me to write a review after watching it.
m_ex_quiry_02_5,The only thing is that
m_ex_quiry_02_6,I find it quite difficult to watch and analyze the movie.
m_ex_quiry_02_7,"To be honest, I know nuts about what people mean by film aesthetics"
m_ex_quiry_02_8,and I've got to stare at a blurry screen for two hours straight.
m_ex_quiry_02_9,What should I do?
m_ex_quiry_02_10,Can't you give your ticket to someone else?
m_ex_quiry_02_11,No can do. The ticket is non-transferable.
m_ex_quiry_02_12,Why don't you just skip it?
m_ex_quiry_02_13,But...
m_ex_quiry_02_14,the reason I was invited is that my all-time favorite radio station
m_ex_quiry_02_15,had selected the story I submitted.
m_ex_quiry_02_16,"They said that they'd love to feature my movie review on their next show,"
m_ex_quiry_02_17,and I'd really love to give it a try.
m_ex_quiry_02_18,How about writing a review that focuses on the movie's audio experience?
m_ex_quiry_02_19,"I could, but I don't think that'd really count as watching the film in its entirety."
m_ex_quiry_02_20,Is it okay to write a review like that?
m_ex_quiry_02_21,"If nothing else, it'd be something novel."
m_ex_quiry_02_22,Hmm...
m_ex_quiry_02_23,"While others are focusing on the visuals,"
m_ex_quiry_02_24,"I'll be concentrating on the sound design, such as the music, sound effects, and dialogue."
m_ex_quiry_02_25,It's definitely something I have great appreciation for.
m_ex_quiry_02_26,"Thanks for the advice,"
m_ex_quiry_02_27,Commander!
m_ex_quiry_02_28,I've never truly experienced the pleasure of watching movies or TV shows
m_ex_quiry_02_29,because of my poor eyesight.
m_ex_quiry_02_30,"However, by shifting my perspective in that direction,"
m_ex_quiry_02_31,I just might find a new way to enjoy them!
m_ex_quiry_02_32,That's great to hear!
m_ex_quiry_02_33,Yes! Hehe.
m_ex_quiry_02_34,So...
m_ex_quiry_02_35,Are you free this weekend?
m_ex_quiry_02_36,I was given a pair of tickets for the premiere.
m_ex_quiry_02_37,"Initially, I was planning to ask Poli or Miranda,"
m_ex_quiry_02_38,"but I would love to attend it with you if you don't mind, Commander."
m_ex_quiry_02_39,Of course. I'd love to go.
m_ex_quiry_02_40,Really?!
m_ex_quiry_02_41,"Then, I'll send you more details later."
m_ex_quiry_02_42,"This is the first time I've ever been so excited to watch a movie, hehe!"
m_ex_quiry_02_43,See you then!
m_ex_quiry_02_44,See ya!
m_ex_quiry_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_quiry_03_2,do you have a moment to spare?
m_ex_quiry_03_3,I've got something important to share.
m_ex_quiry_03_4,"Sure, what's up?"
m_ex_quiry_03_5,I'm always mistaking
m_ex_quiry_03_6,"towels and dolls for Poli,"
m_ex_quiry_03_7,but I've got a towel here
m_ex_quiry_03_8,that doesn't look like her at all.
m_ex_quiry_03_9,Which one?
m_ex_quiry_03_10,The one hanging in the bathroom.
m_ex_quiry_03_11,"Just like any other ordinary morning,"
m_ex_quiry_03_12,I got out of bed and stumbled my way into the bathroom.
m_ex_quiry_03_13,"But today,"
m_ex_quiry_03_14,the towel looked somewhat softer than usual.
m_ex_quiry_03_15,I didn't think much of it and just grabbed it.
m_ex_quiry_03_16,Don't tell me it was Poli?
m_ex_quiry_03_17,Was it a different towel?
m_ex_quiry_03_18,Yeah T^T
m_ex_quiry_03_19,She stepped into the bathroom for a shower a while ago.
m_ex_quiry_03_20,I wish!
m_ex_quiry_03_21,It turned out to be Poli (/ ^ \)
m_ex_quiry_03_22,"I was positive that it was a towel,"
m_ex_quiry_03_23,so I gave it a hard tug.
m_ex_quiry_03_24,"Sure, Poli said it was fine,"
m_ex_quiry_03_25,but I just feel so bad for yanking her hair!
m_ex_quiry_03_26,"Ugh, I've really done it this time! T^T"
m_ex_quiry_03_27,"C'mon, I'm sure it's not that bad."
m_ex_quiry_03_28,You've no idea how hard I yanked on her hair (/^\)
m_ex_quiry_03_29,"I mean, you've done things far worse than that before."
m_ex_quiry_03_30,Well...
m_ex_quiry_03_31,That's true.
m_ex_quiry_03_32,"Poli's also not one to let little things ruffle her feathers, right?"
m_ex_quiry_03_33,That's...
m_ex_quiry_03_34,Hm...
m_ex_quiry_03_35,I guess you're right.
m_ex_quiry_03_36,"Rather than needlessly pondering,"
m_ex_quiry_03_37,I should be working harder to help Poli out.
m_ex_quiry_03_38,"Yes, that's the spirit!"
m_ex_quiry_03_39,"Then, tugging on Poli's hair"
m_ex_quiry_03_40,and catching her in her birthday suit
m_ex_quiry_03_41,"were just another blunder, all thanks to my poor eyesight."
m_ex_quiry_03_42,Wait a second.
m_ex_quiry_03_43,???
m_ex_quiry_03_44,"If I got that right, I think you owe her an apology."
m_ex_quiry_03_45,?!
m_ex_quiry_03_46,"... All right,"
m_ex_quiry_03_47,I'll apologize to her right away.
m_ex_acpu_03_1,"Hey, guys!"
m_ex_acpu_03_2,"We agreed to meet at the park today, right?"
m_ex_acpu_03_3,"We were supposed to meet up a while ago, so when are you guys coming?"
m_ex_acpu_03_4,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_03_5,???
m_ex_acpu_03_6,???
m_ex_acpu_03_7,Huh? What's with everyone's reactions?
m_ex_acpu_03_8,We have plans for today?
m_ex_acpu_03_9,"Yes, we do!"
m_ex_acpu_03_10,Have you forgotten about them already?
m_ex_acpu_03_11,Sigh...
m_ex_acpu_03_12,I had no idea!
m_ex_acpu_03_13,But I'll be there in a jiffy!
m_ex_acpu_03_14,"Hold on a sec, Miranda."
m_ex_acpu_03_15,We still have loads of time to spare before our meetup!
m_ex_acpu_03_16,"Ah, really?"
m_ex_acpu_03_17,Then why is Quiry already there?
m_ex_acpu_03_18,She must have misread the clock again.
m_ex_acpu_03_19,Think about it. Who would hang out at a time like this? It's far too early.
m_ex_acpu_03_20,???
m_ex_acpu_03_21,"Oh, darn it!"
m_ex_acpu_03_22,You're right.
m_ex_acpu_03_23,How did I get the time wrong again? :/
m_ex_acpu_03_24,"That's why I keep telling you to check your phone or tablet for the time,"
m_ex_acpu_03_25,especially when you find that the dormitory clock is difficult to read.
m_ex_acpu_03_26,"I didn't hear the alarm go off, so I thought I overslept."
m_ex_acpu_03_27,That's why I glanced hastily at the clock before bolting out the door.
m_ex_acpu_03_28,Wait a sec.
m_ex_acpu_03_29,Does this mean
m_ex_acpu_03_30,I just woke you all up?
m_ex_acpu_03_31,"I'm all right since I'm an early riser,"
m_ex_acpu_03_32,but I can't say the same for Miranda and Commander.
m_ex_acpu_03_33,The loud beeping from Bla woke me up.
m_ex_acpu_03_34,I was up early as well.
m_ex_acpu_03_35,"Oh dear,"
m_ex_acpu_03_36,I'm really sorry about that.
m_ex_acpu_03_37,You must be so exhausted right now.
m_ex_acpu_03_38,It's okay.
m_ex_acpu_03_39,:'(
m_ex_acpu_03_40,Really?
m_ex_acpu_03_41,"Phew, that's a relief!"
m_ex_acpu_03_42,But I apologize for disturbing you >~<
m_ex_acpu_03_43,"What about you, Miranda?"
m_ex_acpu_03_44,Did I wake you up?
m_ex_acpu_03_45,I'm not quite sure.
m_ex_acpu_03_46,I've been talking to you since I opened my eyes.
m_ex_acpu_03_47,I guess it's safe to say that I've woken you up.
m_ex_acpu_03_48,I'm really sorry!
m_ex_acpu_03_49,Dinner's on me tonight.
m_ex_acpu_03_50,"You don't have to do that,"
m_ex_acpu_03_51,but I won't turn it down either.
m_ex_acpu_03_52,"You're treating us to dinner, Quiry?"
m_ex_acpu_03_53,Thanks!
m_ex_acpu_03_54,"No worries, hehe!"
m_ex_acpu_03_55,"So, er..."
m_ex_acpu_03_56,Does anyone happen to have some spare time? I could really use a lift!
m_ex_acpu_03_57,Didn't you get there all by yourself?
m_ex_acpu_03_58,"Yeah, but..."
m_ex_acpu_03_59,I don't remember how to get back.
m_ex_acpu_03_60,Hehe ^_^|||
m_ex_acpu_03_61,Lol
m_ex_acpu_03_62,I knew this would happen.
m_ex_acpu_03_63,"No worries, I'll go get you."
m_ex_acpu_03_64,"You're the best, Poli!"
m_ex_acpu_03_65,"So, let's meet up later as planned."
m_ex_acpu_03_66,"Okay, got it!"
m_ex_acpu_03_67,Sure thing.
m_ex_acpu_04_1,Excuuuyse me
m_ex_acpu_04_2,Amm iio typing right?
m_ex_acpu_04_3,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_04_4,"What's going on over there, Quiry?"
m_ex_acpu_04_5,My leens
m_ex_acpu_04_6,isnot d
m_ex_acpu_04_7,"Quiry, are you all right?"
m_ex_acpu_04_8,Is Quiry...
m_ex_acpu_04_9,in trouble?
m_ex_acpu_04_10,Maybe she's trying to send us coded messages.
m_ex_acpu_04_11,"Is that what you are doing, Quiry?"
m_ex_acpu_04_12,Send us a number if you're in danger!
m_ex_acpu_04_13,Wha2
m_ex_acpu_04_14,"Omg, omg, she sent a number!"
m_ex_acpu_04_15,She's really in danger!
m_ex_acpu_04_16,"Everyone, get ready to move out."
m_ex_acpu_04_17,"Hold on,"
m_ex_acpu_04_18,everyone!
m_ex_acpu_04_19,I'm perfectly fine!!
m_ex_acpu_04_20,Huh?
m_ex_acpu_04_21,What happened?
m_ex_acpu_04_22,Well...
m_ex_acpu_04_23,I was just trying out some new contact lenses
m_ex_acpu_04_24,and I can now see things in the distance so clearly!
m_ex_acpu_04_25,Nice!
m_ex_acpu_04_26,"So, does this mean you have perfect vision now?"
m_ex_acpu_04_27,"Nope,"
m_ex_acpu_04_28,I can hardly see anything close up.
m_ex_acpu_04_29,That's why I couldn't type properly.
m_ex_acpu_04_30,What in the world?
m_ex_acpu_04_31,"Your eyes are a never-ending mystery, Quiry."
m_ex_acpu_04_32,T_T
m_ex_acpu_04_33,What if you wear a contact lens on just one eye?
m_ex_acpu_04_34,Wouldn't you be able to see things up close and in a distance just fine?
m_ex_acpu_04_35,Oooh!
m_ex_acpu_04_36,!!
m_ex_acpu_04_37,That's a fantastic idea!
m_ex_acpu_04_38,"Hold on,"
m_ex_acpu_04_39,let me give it a try.
m_ex_acpu_04_40,"If this ends up working,"
m_ex_acpu_04_41,Quiry will be over the moon.
m_ex_acpu_04_42,For sure.
m_ex_acpu_04_43,Er...
m_ex_acpu_04_44,Hmm?
m_ex_acpu_04_45,"Whoa, the world is spinning!"
m_ex_acpu_04_46,"I feel really,"
m_ex_acpu_04_47,really dizzy!
m_ex_acpu_04_48,T_T
m_ex_acpu_04_49,Can you see clearly now?
m_ex_acpu_04_50,Not at all.
m_ex_acpu_04_51,"I can kinda make out some stuff, but everything's a blur,"
m_ex_acpu_04_52,and it's making me feel downright queasy.
m_ex_acpu_04_53,"Argh, I can't take it anymore! I'm taking the lens out and chucking it away."
m_ex_acpu_04_54,What a shame :/
m_ex_acpu_04_55,I'm sure Quiry'll see the world clearly one day.
m_ex_acpu_04_56,That's right!
m_ex_acpu_04_57,Don't let this get you down!
m_ex_acpu_04_58,Okay!
m_ex_acpu_04_59,"Thanks, everyone!"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_1,Naga has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_2,Tia?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_3,Teacher?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_4,Where have you two been? Why didn't you reply?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_5,The lottery's already over. I didn't win anything.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_6,What about you two?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_7,Whoops!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_8,Sorry!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_9,I was too occupied with the event. Hahaha.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_10,I didn't even notice that you contacted me♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_11,No luck on my end either.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_12,...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_13,What about Teacher?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_14,We should meet up and look for him.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_15,It's too crowded here.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_16,Let's meet at
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_17,the entrance of the shopping mall.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_18,What do you think?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_19,"All right, sure♥"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_20,It'll be easier to find Teacher
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_21,if the two of us work together.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_22,Maybe he won something from the lottery!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_23,Hehehe. I can't wait to see him!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_01_24,See you at the entrance♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_1,"Hey, Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_2,Yes?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_3,"Oh, nothing. I just wanted to contact you."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_4,A lot happened today.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_5,It's a little...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_6,Well...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_7,"I'm just a bit flustered,"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_8,that's all.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_9,That's why I came to you.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_10,I think I'm gonna send you more personal messages from now on.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_11,Tia would see this if I used the chat group.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_12,So I've got to be careful with what I say in there.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_13,You know what I'm getting at?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_14,Not quite.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_15,"Come on, Teacher!"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_16,Use your head!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_17,Didn't I announce that I would compete against Tia?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_18,Don't you think it'd be strange if I started acting buddy-buddy with her
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_19,after making such a declaration?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_20,"Soooo, I'll send you personal messages from here on out."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_21,I still can't believe this is all really happening.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_22,"I never would've thought you'd be the one teaching us, lol!"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_23,"If there's anything I don't understand, it's okay if I ask you, right?"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_24,Of course.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_25,Teehee!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_26,So I can have some extra tutoring?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_27,If time allows.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_28,Really?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_29,How kind of you! Hehe.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_30,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_02_31,See you tomorrow!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_1,Teacher♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_2,It's so nice being able to talk to you alone.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_3,What's wrong with the group chat?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_4,Erm...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_5,I don't think I'll be using that for a while.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_6,"Naga and I are competitors now, after all."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_7,"Given the dynamic between us at the moment,"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_8,it'd hardly be prudent for us to be sharing information with each other
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_9,in the group chat.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_10,So I figure it's best if I just talk to you like this.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_11,Just the two of us♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_12,Fair enough.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_13,Haha. Great!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_14,"Oh, happy day!"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_15,I just can't get enough of shopping.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_16,"Nothing beats the thrill of taking part in a raffle, either."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_17,Even though you were the only one who won a prize.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_18,I was just lucky.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_19,LOL
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_20,You know what?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_21,I had a feeling you were going to win.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_22,"Dunno why, just did."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_23,So you can imagine how happy I was when you actually won!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_24,It was like I'd won the lottery myself.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_25,"I get to see you tomorrow too, right?"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_26,Hehe.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_27,I'm gonna be way too excited to sleep tonight XD
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_28,I'm just so happy♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_29,"See you tomorrow, Teacher♥"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_03_30,Bye!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_1,Teacher...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_2,Erm...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_3,Have you and Tia met up recently?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_4,??
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_5,...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_6,Nothing.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_7,Sorry.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_8,Pretend I never said anything.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_04_9,See you tomorrow.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_1,Teacher!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_2,Listen to me!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_3,I'm curious about something.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_4,What is it?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_5,Erm...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_6,Have you...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_7,and Naga...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_8,Did you two meet up recently?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_9,Just the two of you？
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_10,...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_11,...
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_12,"Agh, never mind. Forget it."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_13,?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_14,I'm afraid it'll only be worse if I hear the answer.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_05_15,Pretend I didn't say anything.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_1,"Hey, Teacher♥"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_2,"Helloooo, Teacher!"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_3,"I missed you so much, so I had to send you a message."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_4,"I'm sure you miss us too, isn't that right?"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_5,"I know you do, hehe♥♥♥"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_6,My goodness.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_7,You're awfully... upfront.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_8,Seems like you're more attached to Teacher than before.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_9,"You'll have to forgive her for her impulsiveness, Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_10,So you two have buried the hatchet?
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_11,Naturally!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_12,Sorry if we caused you any undue concern.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_13,We know how awkward it must have been for you.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_14,"Yeah, sorry."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_15,It won't happen again♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_16,"Tia wants to become a responsible adult,"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_17,"so if you could treat her more like a grown-up from now on,"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_18,that'd be fantastic.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_19,Yeah!
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_20,I wanna try my best to become an outstanding bonafide adult♥
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_21,Then I'll be able to dress in more revealing clothes and give you a private danq124l&$%
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_22,wqeasdqe
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_23,My apologies.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_24,"Tia was about to say something she'd regret,"
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_25,so I took it upon myself to take away her cellphone.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_26,"Anyway, thank you for all the fun we've had these past few days."
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_27,Don't forget to come and see us
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_28,when you have time.
m_ex_dazzlingcupid_06_29,Sure thing.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_1,"Hey there, Teacher!"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_2,"Sorry to bother you, but here's a question."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_3,Can we talk about it for a while on Bla?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_4,Sure.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_5,Great♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_6,My question is...
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_7,How's your memory?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_8,Pretty good.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_9,Not so good.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_10,"Really? I suppose that makes sense for you, hehe♥"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_11,"Then that makes two of us, ha!"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_12,What do you do
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_13,when you've got to
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_14,remember something
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_15,really important?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_16,Take notes.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_17,Set an alarm.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_18,"You see, Tia?"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_19,Teacher uses the exact same method.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_20,Hmm...
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_21,What's the matter?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_22,Tia is constantly forgetting things.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_23,"Especially things that she needs to prepare beforehand, including her homework."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_24,So I suggested she start taking notes or setting an alarm clock.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_25,Something. Anything.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_26,But she insists that nothing will make a difference.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_27,"I'm telling you,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_28,none of those methods will be any help for me.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_29,Why's that?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_30,Because
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_31,"even if I take notes,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_32,I'd eventually just end up
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_33,forgetting that I'd taken notes.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_34,"As for alarm clocks,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_35,I'd forget why I set the alarm in the first place.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_36,So I've still got to depend on Naga to remind me about stuff♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_37,"See, now that doesn't make any sense to me."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_38,You never forget anything about the lessons in class.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_39,Because those are what really matter.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_40,So how you dress yourself doesn't matter?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_41,Well...
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_42,"I guess I've just gotten used to you preparing all that for me, hehe."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_43,Give me a break!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_44,Are you telling me I've got to forever be responsible for your own wardrobe?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_45,Yep!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_46,"I'm never worried about forgetting stuff,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_47,because I know you'll always be there to bring me a spare♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_48,"When you think about it, Naga is your notes and alarm clock."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_49,"Hmm,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_50,"I never thought about it that way, but I guess you're right."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_51,"I'd be helpless without you, Naga♥"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_52,So that's it?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_53,I just...
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_01_54,"Ugh, fine."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_1,E
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_2,EEEEE
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_3,EEEEE
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_4,EE
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_5,Naga?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_6,"Oh, hey Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_7,What's the matter?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_8,I was going to ask you the same thing.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_9,Huh?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_10,Didn't you just send some messages?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_11,"I did? Oh, now I see."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_12,"Wow, I didn't even notice!"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_13,"I guess I butt-dialed you, hehe."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_14,???
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_15,Hehe.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_16,"Sorry about that, Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_17,"Exams are only a few days away,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_18,and Naga is in rough shape.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_19,She always acts a little strange
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_20,when exams roll around.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_21,"Oh come on,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_22,you're exaggerating.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_23,"Are you having a hard time, Naga?"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_24,I'm fine!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_25,Honestly.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_26,Are you sure?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_27,It's not good to lie.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_28,It's okay. You can tell Teacher and me the truth.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_29,"Yeah, tell us everything."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_30,I appreciate you both saying that.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_31,Very well.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_32,I'd be lying if I said
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_33,"the exams weren't getting under my skin a bit,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_34,but I'm not nearly as frantic as Tia makes me out to be.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_35,"There, satisfied?"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_36,Total honesty.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_37,Naga.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_38,Look into my eyes.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_39,The eyes never lie.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_40,They will tell me the truth now!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_41,?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_42,We're chatting on Bla.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_43,How could I show you my eyes?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_44,Oh... I guess you're right.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_45,Fine. Then I'll just wait until we meet up to see whether you're lying♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_46,Let's meet up! Where are you now?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_47,I'm on my way to the classroom.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_48,"Great, I'll wait for you there."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_49,"Teacher,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_50,"if Naga can't shake off her bad mood,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_51,can I count on you to be my backup?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_52,The three of us could meet up and go get something sweet to eat.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_53,I'm sure that'd lift her spirits♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_54,Sure.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_55,Wait a second.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_56,You're the only one who likes desserts here.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_57,"Hee hee, I'm so happy!"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_58,Teacher agreed♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_59,"See you around, Teacher♥"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_02_60,Bye!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_1,I can't even...
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_2,Come on!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_3,Teacher!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_4,Yes?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_5,These freshmen nowadays are out of control!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_6,"Take it easy, Naga."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_7,I can't take it anymore!
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_8,It's too much.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_9,Having trouble with some of the freshmen?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_10,We met some new students
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_11,a moment ago.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_12,"They greeted me very politely, as they should, given that I was a senior student."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_13,"However, they acted very casually in front of Tia."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_14,I was trying to figure out why they behaved like that.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_15,"Turns out, they thought I was from the graduating class,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_16,while they mistook Tia as being in the same grade as them.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_17,"Tell me,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_18,do I really look that old when I'm with Tia?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_19,"Everyone always says I seem like Tia's mom,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_20,but I thought that was just in reference to me taking care of her like a mother.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_21,Have they actually just been saying that I look old this whole time?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_22,"No, not at all."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_23,Huh?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_24,You think so?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_25,Absolutely.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_26,See?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_27,I told you that's not what they meant.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_28,"I just forgot my graduating class badge,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_29,so they couldn't tell what grade I was in.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_30,"You're overthinking this, Naga."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_31,No one could ever accuse you of being looking haggard ♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_32,Please.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_33,You've always been the cute one.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_34,"My goodness, you've got me feeling"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_35,flustered now.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_36,I need a drink.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_37,Hahahaha.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_38,"Naga just ran off, and her face was beet red♥"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_39,She's always been sensitive about her looks.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_40,I think this whole misunderstanding made her a little embarrassed.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_41,Huh?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_42,"Whoops, I just realized this is the group chat."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_43,"Well, I guess it doesn't really matter♥"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_44,"Anyway, thanks for helping her, Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_45,You're the best♥
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_46,Don't mention it.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_47,"And modest, to boot! That makes you even cooler in my book."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_48,"Honestly, Tia,"
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_49,do you always have to have such a big mouth?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_50,"We've got to get to our next class. Bye, Teacher."
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_51,Huh?
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_52,We're finished with classes todayyyyyyyy
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_53,Hehe.
m_ex_dazzlingpearl_03_54,See you soon.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_1,Ein has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_2,Ein has invited Rei to join the group.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_3,Ein has invited Zwei to join the group.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_4,"All right,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_5,that should be everyone.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_6,??
m_ex_schooloflock_01_7,What's this group for?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_8,Not another bizarre group chat...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_9,"Aw, come on, it's totally normal!"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_10,"I spoke with Rei,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_11,and she said it'd be a shame if we parted from Teach so soon.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_12,"Also, I had a few questions that I wanted to ask,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_13,so I created this group.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_14,"Yeah,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_15,I've got lotsa questions too!
m_ex_schooloflock_01_16,"Teach,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_17,is there any chance you could tell us what questions will be in this test?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_18,"Come on, you know that's not gonna happen."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_19,"I know,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_20,but I really want to know :(
m_ex_schooloflock_01_21,I don't know what any of the test questions will be.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_22,You don't?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_23,Nope.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_24,Not even one?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_25,Not even one.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_26,What?!
m_ex_schooloflock_01_27,"Darn, talk about dashed hopes."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_28,"I thought I could at least get a hint or something,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_29,but apparently not.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_30,What are your test questions usually about?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_31,"Battle formations,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_32,"how to cope in high-stress environments, other combat-related knowledge..."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_33,There's also Ark history...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_34,"Law,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_35,"math, science,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_36,"humanities,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_37,some general knowledge questions...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_38,Wow!
m_ex_schooloflock_01_39,"You're amazing, Zwei."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_40,That's quite a laundry list of topics.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_41,Then what do you think the questions would be about this time?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_42,Hmm...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_43,"Something from the textbook,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_44,I'd imagine.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_45,No way.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_46,Hahahaha! That much is obvious enough.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_47,"If you know so much about what's gonna be on the test, then why don't you go take action?"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_48,"Instead of wasting time spouting nonsense in here,"
m_ex_schooloflock_01_49,go start studying!
m_ex_schooloflock_01_50,!!
m_ex_schooloflock_01_51,Just remember to put all your pencils and erasers to the right.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_52,Eh?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_53,To the right of what?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_54,I'm turning off notifications for this group.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_55,"See you at the exam, Teacher."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_56,Zwei.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_57,Zwei?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_58,"Jeez, she actually stopped answering."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_59,She really beat a swift retreat.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_60,But how come?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_61,She doesn't really like talking about things like these.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_62,I have a question.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_63,How come Zwei studies so hard?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_64,Could it be...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_65,What?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_66,Could it be what?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_67,"Oh boy, here we go again."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_68,I'm gonna turn off notifications as well.
m_ex_schooloflock_01_69,"See you at the exam, Teach."
m_ex_schooloflock_01_70,Huh? Now Ein's leaving?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_71,...
m_ex_schooloflock_01_72,Why isn't anyone replying?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_73,Teacher?
m_ex_schooloflock_01_74,I'll also turn off notifications until after the exam.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_1,How did everyone do on the exam?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_2,Terrible.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_3,Ha!
m_ex_schooloflock_02_4,"You've really given up, haven't you?"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_5,Give up? What are you talking about?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_6,Nothing.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_7,"You're just so adorable, that's all."
m_ex_schooloflock_02_8,"What about you, Zwei?"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_9,Me?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_10,Same as usual.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_11,Oh...
m_ex_schooloflock_02_12,Does that mean you did well?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_13,Hard to say.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_14,"I'll take that as a yes, ha."
m_ex_schooloflock_02_15,I never said that.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_16,"How was it invigilating the exam, Teacher?"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_17,Did you see how hard I was working? Did I nail it?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_18,The funniest part was when you were struggling to stay awake.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_19,You clearly were working very hard to answer all the questions.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_20,Ha! You had a hard time staying awake?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_21,I did not!
m_ex_schooloflock_02_22,I was still able to hand in my exam paper!
m_ex_schooloflock_02_23,Are we supposed to think that's impressive?
m_ex_schooloflock_02_24,"Were you able to answer all the questions, Rei?"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_25,"Of course! I'm a senior, after all!"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_26,You started nodding off 5 minutes after you started writing.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_27,lolololololol
m_ex_schooloflock_02_28,I knew it.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_29,That's not true!
m_ex_schooloflock_02_30,Naru said it was a solid seven minutes before I nodded off.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_31,Uh-huh.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_32,So take that!
m_ex_schooloflock_02_33,"Well, regardless, thank you for your hard work, everyone."
m_ex_schooloflock_02_34,"Hee hee. Thank you, Teacher."
m_ex_schooloflock_02_35,Thanks.
m_ex_schooloflock_02_36,"Not sure if that really applies to me,"
m_ex_schooloflock_02_37,"but thanks anyway, Teach!"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_1,Ein has invited Marciana to join the group.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_2,Ein has invited Tercera to join the group.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_3,Everyone related to the practical exam is here now.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_4,?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_5,"What, may I ask, is this group chat for?"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_6,Just a place for people
m_ex_schooloflock_03_7,who are attending the same exam to chat.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_8,"Hey, Marciana."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_9,"Oh, the Commander is in here as well?"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_10,Yep!
m_ex_schooloflock_03_11,"Tercera, on the other hand, is pretty inactive."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_12,She hasn't checked her Bla in ages.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_13,Leave her be.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_14,Maybe she just wants to be alone
m_ex_schooloflock_03_15,for the time being.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_16,Okay.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_17,"She'll come tomorrow, anyway."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_18,Hopefully!
m_ex_schooloflock_03_19,I just checked on her. I think she's sleeping in her room.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_20,I'll let her know when she wakes up.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_21,"Okay, great."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_22,Okie-dokie.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_23,How is everyone's preparation
m_ex_schooloflock_03_24,for the practical exam coming along?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_25,Huh?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_26,?!
m_ex_schooloflock_03_27,Er...
m_ex_schooloflock_03_28,I think inviting Miss Marciana into this group may have been a mistake.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_29,"Ein,"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_30,haven't I told you before?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_31,Practical exams must be treated like actual battle exercises.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_32,I'll start preparing right away.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_33,I'll also turn off notifications.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_34,"I'm going to get ready, too."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_35,See you at the exam.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_36,"You're doing your best to prepare too, right, Commander?"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_37,On my way to prepare right now.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_38,Hm.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_39,You all are being a bit too casual about this.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_40,We're just carefree people!
m_ex_schooloflock_03_41,"So, are you all set, Rei?"
m_ex_schooloflock_03_42,Yep!
m_ex_schooloflock_03_43,"Naru 1, 2, and 3 are all here."
m_ex_schooloflock_03_44,Tools for first aid?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_45,Huh?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_46,Weapons for emergency response?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_47,Er...
m_ex_schooloflock_03_48,All settled?
m_ex_schooloflock_03_49,Um... I'll go get them ready straight away.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_50,Fine.
m_ex_schooloflock_03_51,I'll see you all at the exam.
m_ex_schooloflock_04_1,Attention everyone!
m_ex_schooloflock_04_2,Our beloved Rei has arranged it so that
m_ex_schooloflock_04_3,we'll be doing the practical exam last.
m_ex_schooloflock_04_4,"So no pressure, guys! Hahaha!"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_5,"It wasn't that big a deal,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_6,you don't have to blow it out of proportion...
m_ex_schooloflock_04_7,Isn't this amazing?
m_ex_schooloflock_04_8,I can't stop laughing! Haha!
m_ex_schooloflock_04_9,I never thought
m_ex_schooloflock_04_10,begging and crying would actually work.
m_ex_schooloflock_04_11,"Don't call it begging,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_12,call it strategy!
m_ex_schooloflock_04_13,That might be a bit of a stretch.
m_ex_schooloflock_04_14,"At any rate,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_15,"Rei managed to get us to take the test last,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_16,"so don't worry so much, and just be careful, you two."
m_ex_schooloflock_04_17,"And if you're seeing this, Tercera,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_18,don't forget to come!
m_ex_schooloflock_04_19,I still remember
m_ex_schooloflock_04_20,"how when we were freshmen,"
m_ex_schooloflock_04_21,we promised to meet up and have cups of parfait together.
m_ex_schooloflock_04_22,Now it's gonna become a reality!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_1,"Hey, everyone."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_2,"Thanks to you,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_3,I passed the exam.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_4,Sorry for not being in touch lately.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_5,I can't thank you all enough.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_6,Congrats!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_7,"I knew you could do it,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_8,"but nevertheless,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_9,congratulations!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_10,Thanks!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_11,Teacher!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_12,Teacher!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_13,We passed as well!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_14,"Then congratulations to you as well, Rei."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_15,Congratulations to everyone.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_16,What a nice and jovial atmosphere.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_17,"I hate to interrupt,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_18,but I just have to say that Rei is really something else.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_19,Oh boy...
m_ex_schooloflock_05_20,Huh?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_21,Did I do something wrong?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_22,Don't worry about it.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_23,?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_24,"Anyway,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_25,"now that the exam is done and we all passed,"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_26,it's high time we treat ourselves to some parfait.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_27,"Would you like to come, teachers?"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_28,"Thanks, but I'll sit this one out."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_29,Just take Commander with you.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_30,Why is that?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_31,"You should come too, Miss Marciana."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_32,Occasions like this are best celebrated with your fellow schoolmates.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_33,Says who?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_34,"Come on, just come with us."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_35,Tercera told me she knows a great place.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_36,Yeah!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_37,I prefer celebrating with my teachers.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_38,We want to treat you to some good food.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_39,Would you please go with us?
m_ex_schooloflock_05_40,"Well, I..."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_41,You should come. The students are really looking forward to it.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_42,"Even you, Commander?"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_43,"Come on, let's go!"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_44,Join us!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_45,"Yeah, join us!"
m_ex_schooloflock_05_46,It'll be fun!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_47,"All right, fine."
m_ex_schooloflock_05_48,I'll come.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_49,Yahoo!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_50,Yipee!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_51,We'll meet you at the school gate after school. See you then.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_52,See you around!
m_ex_schooloflock_05_53,See you.
m_ex_schooloflock_05_54,"Okay, catch you all later."
m_ex_tove_01_1,Hello Survivalist!
m_ex_tove_01_2,This is Tove.
m_ex_tove_01_3,I'm a new recruit from Unlimited.
m_ex_tove_01_4,I'm also a survival expert.
m_ex_tove_01_5,"I know you, haha."
m_ex_tove_01_6,Have you found your place within the squad?
m_ex_tove_01_7,Have you been able to use any of your survival skills?
m_ex_tove_01_8,Hehe.
m_ex_tove_01_9,I figured since it was my first time texting you I should still introduce myself.
m_ex_tove_01_10,I have.
m_ex_tove_01_11,"In an environment as harsh and unforgiving as the Northern Base,"
m_ex_tove_01_12,a survival expert like me is practically indispensable.
m_ex_tove_01_13,Every day.
m_ex_tove_01_14,"We are in the north, after all."
m_ex_tove_01_15,This is a place with rough terrain and severe weather all year round.
m_ex_tove_01_16,"I must admit,"
m_ex_tove_01_17,"after lighting fires and hunting together out in the wild,"
m_ex_tove_01_18,it feels kind of strange for us
m_ex_tove_01_19,to be communicating through something like this.
m_ex_tove_01_20,"It does feel kinda odd, hehe."
m_ex_tove_01_21,Have you been able to use any of the survival techniques I taught you?
m_ex_tove_01_22,I imagine that you could find yourself in all sorts of extreme situations
m_ex_tove_01_23,when you're out on a mission.
m_ex_tove_01_24,Hmm...
m_ex_tove_01_25,I ruminate over some of the recent missions.
m_ex_tove_01_26,I think there were a few.
m_ex_tove_01_27,Oooh!
m_ex_tove_01_28,Like what?
m_ex_tove_01_29,What'd you end up using?
m_ex_tove_01_30,I feel so proud already!
m_ex_tove_01_31,We ran out of emergency rations in the forest.
m_ex_tove_01_32,We ran out of water in the desert.
m_ex_tove_01_33,But the forest is a food source in and of itself!
m_ex_tove_01_34,"It's teeming with wildlife, mushrooms, and fruit."
m_ex_tove_01_35,"So long as you can distinguish the poisonous ones from the non-poisonous ones,"
m_ex_tove_01_36,you could have a veritable feast on your hands.
m_ex_tove_01_37,"So, just like you taught me, I suggested that we eat some beetles."
m_ex_tove_01_38,What happened then?
m_ex_tove_01_39,They gave me a deadly glare.
m_ex_tove_01_40,Oh.
m_ex_tove_01_41,Hmm...
m_ex_tove_01_42,"In the desert, hydration is of paramount importance."
m_ex_tove_01_43,Running out of water is tantamount to disaster.
m_ex_tove_01_44,Your best bet would be to gather what water you could from some plant life.
m_ex_tove_01_45,"If that's not possible, you'd have to collect dew using a container of some kind."
m_ex_tove_01_46,That's what I suggested.
m_ex_tove_01_47,What happened then?
m_ex_tove_01_48,They looked at me with a pitiful gaze.
m_ex_tove_01_49,Oh.
m_ex_tove_01_50,Hmm...
m_ex_tove_01_51,Haha.
m_ex_tove_01_52,Don't worry too much about what other people say.
m_ex_tove_01_53,"In life-threatening situations, improvisation is key."
m_ex_tove_01_54,Things that may seem completely out of left field could end up saving your life.
m_ex_tove_01_55,"I know, but I still felt awkward."
m_ex_tove_01_56,"Trust me, I understand what you mean."
m_ex_tove_01_57,I get plenty of strange looks from my squadmates all the time.
m_ex_tove_01_58,Just keep at it.
m_ex_tove_01_59,The most important thing in survival is not conforming to common sense
m_ex_tove_01_60,"or avoiding embarrassment,"
m_ex_tove_01_61,but rather protecting the lives of our comrades.
m_ex_tove_01_62,That's a great way to think about it.
m_ex_tove_01_63,Hehe.
m_ex_tove_01_64,"The next time we meet,"
m_ex_tove_01_65,I'll teach you some even better survival techniques.
m_ex_tove_01_66,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_tove_02_1,Survivalist.
m_ex_tove_02_2,Survivalist.
m_ex_tove_02_3,"Finally, it sent!"
m_ex_tove_02_4,"Finally, it sent!"
m_ex_tove_02_5,Why are your messages coming through twice?
m_ex_tove_02_6,Sorry.
m_ex_tove_02_7,The reception here is all over the place.
m_ex_tove_02_8,"I tried to resend a message that hadn't gone through,"
m_ex_tove_02_9,and ended up sending it twice.
m_ex_tove_02_10,Where are you that reception is so bad?
m_ex_tove_02_11,NBE 30.55.
m_ex_tove_02_12,Those were the last coordinates I checked.
m_ex_tove_02_13,"I was on a mission with Alice,"
m_ex_tove_02_14,but then she saw a polar fox.
m_ex_tove_02_15,"Well, she thought it was absolutely adorable, and chased after it."
m_ex_tove_02_16,And you know how agile she can be.
m_ex_tove_02_17,"I couldn't catch up with her, and ended up stranded all on my own."
m_ex_tove_02_18,Sounds like you're in quite a bind.
m_ex_tove_02_19,A polar fox?! I can't blame her.
m_ex_tove_02_20,Yeah...
m_ex_tove_02_21,"In the beginning, I felt disappointed that I wasn't able to catch up to Alice,"
m_ex_tove_02_22,and I was starting to feel a bit down.
m_ex_tove_02_23,I know.
m_ex_tove_02_24,"Trust me, I wasn't exactly surprised that Alice took off running."
m_ex_tove_02_25,I can't even really blame her.
m_ex_tove_02_26,But then I remembered.
m_ex_tove_02_27,I'm the greatest survivalist
m_ex_tove_02_28,this generation has ever known!
m_ex_tove_02_29,So I snapped out of it and started doing what had to be done.
m_ex_tove_02_30,"I've got a fire going, and I already fabricated a shelter."
m_ex_tove_02_31,"I managed to get some good grub while out foraging,"
m_ex_tove_02_32,"and it all made me think of you, so I decided to send a message."
m_ex_tove_02_33,"I appreciate that, but..."
m_ex_tove_02_34,?
m_ex_tove_02_35,Shouldn't you be trying to get in touch with your squadmates instead?
m_ex_tove_02_36,Tove doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_tove_02_37,Ah.
m_ex_tove_02_38,You're right.
m_ex_tove_02_39,That's what I should do.
m_ex_tove_02_40,"Just a moment, I'll contact them."
m_ex_tove_02_41,"Just a moment, I'll contact them."
m_ex_tove_02_42,"Ugh, it's happening again."
m_ex_tove_02_43,"Ugh, it's happening again."
m_ex_tove_02_44,Poor signal again?
m_ex_tove_02_45,Failed to send message.
m_ex_tove_02_46,I should share Tove's coordinates with the rest of Unlimited.
m_ex_tove_03_1,Survivalist.
m_ex_tove_03_2,I've been thinking
m_ex_tove_03_3,about doing a survival show.
m_ex_tove_03_4,A survival show?
m_ex_tove_03_5,Yes!
m_ex_tove_03_6,They used to be really popular back in the olden days.
m_ex_tove_03_7,They're TV shows about how to survive in the wilderness.
m_ex_tove_03_8,Sounds fun.
m_ex_tove_03_9,Hehe.
m_ex_tove_03_10,"There's no such thing as untamed wilderness in the Ark,"
m_ex_tove_03_11,"and hardly anyone living there has been up to the surface,"
m_ex_tove_03_12,so I'm sure a show like that would be a big hit.
m_ex_tove_03_13,I'm just not sure what the first episode should be about.
m_ex_tove_03_14,There's just so much content to choose from.
m_ex_tove_03_15,I'm not sure where to start.
m_ex_tove_03_16,What about bizarre food sources found in the wild?
m_ex_tove_03_17,What about you versus wild animals?
m_ex_tove_03_18,"Oh, that's a great idea!"
m_ex_tove_03_19,Let's see...
m_ex_tove_03_20,What would people find most fascinating:
m_ex_tove_03_21,The eyeballs or the heart of a dead animal?
m_ex_tove_03_22,Spiders and centipedes with their venom removed?
m_ex_tove_03_23,"Then again, I don't really like creepy crawlies."
m_ex_tove_03_24,"I mean, I'll choke them down if things get desperate,"
m_ex_tove_03_25,but I'm not gonna go out of my way to eat them.
m_ex_tove_03_26,"Since there are some insects I don't mind, like grasshoppers."
m_ex_tove_03_27,Maybe I could show that.
m_ex_tove_03_28,Hmm...
m_ex_tove_03_29,I'd say the most dangerous of all the northern wildlife
m_ex_tove_03_30,"would be the bear,"
m_ex_tove_03_31,so perhaps I should gear towards something like me versus one of them?
m_ex_tove_03_32,... You're planning on fighting a bear?
m_ex_tove_03_33,Of course not.
m_ex_tove_03_34,Do you realize how highly animals are valued in the Ark?
m_ex_tove_03_35,"I could handle it, but the viewers would turn against me in an instant."
m_ex_tove_03_36,"So, I'll just proceed as if I'm a regular human,"
m_ex_tove_03_37,and just advise people on how to avoid bears altogether.
m_ex_tove_03_38,"Or, if you encounter one, merely how to survive."
m_ex_tove_03_39,Hehe.
m_ex_tove_03_40,I think we've got a solid game plan for the first episode.
m_ex_tove_03_41,The only thing left to do is put it into action!
m_ex_tove_03_42,"Unfortunately, we don't have any cameramen here at the Northern Base."
m_ex_tove_03_43,I'll have to stick my phone onto a selfie stick and secure that to my bag.
m_ex_tove_03_44,I wonder how the footage will come out.
m_ex_tove_03_45,I'm willing to bet it'll be awfully shaky.
m_ex_tove_03_46,Yeah... I guess that's not really feasible.
m_ex_tove_03_47,I'll have to come up with something else
m_ex_tove_03_48,or wait for you to help me the next time you come by the base.
m_ex_tove_03_49,"Still, I'll give the selfie stick thing a shot just to be sure."
m_ex_tove_03_50,"If the footage comes out decent, I'll show it to you."
m_ex_tove_03_51,Looking forward to seeing it.
m_ex_tove_03_52,"Hehe, I'll let you know."
m_ex_matis_04_1,Ugh. Honestly.
m_ex_matis_04_2,I can't even.
m_ex_matis_04_3,What's wrong?
m_ex_matis_04_4,These two are driving me crazy.
m_ex_matis_04_5,"Who, exactly?"
m_ex_matis_04_6,Are you talking about Drake and Birdie?
m_ex_matis_04_7,No!
m_ex_matis_04_8,She is talking about Laplace and Maxwell.
m_ex_matis_04_9,Why would I talk about myself?
m_ex_matis_04_10,What on earth is going on?
m_ex_matis_04_11,"Oh,"
m_ex_matis_04_12,"I'm sorry, Cutey."
m_ex_matis_04_13,You must be confused.
m_ex_matis_04_14,"While I converse with these two,"
m_ex_matis_04_15,I want to hear your opinion.
m_ex_matis_04_16,That's basically like you're tattling on us!
m_ex_matis_04_17,"That's not very heroic of you, Maxwell."
m_ex_matis_04_18,What is this?
m_ex_matis_04_19,Ratting on someone or talking about them behind their back
m_ex_matis_04_20,is despicable!
m_ex_matis_04_21,"If you have any grievances with us, say it to our face."
m_ex_matis_04_22,I'm about to.
m_ex_matis_04_23,Oh?
m_ex_matis_04_24,Here we go.
m_ex_matis_04_25,"It's like this, Cutey."
m_ex_matis_04_26,"All of us share a bedroom together in our dorm,"
m_ex_matis_04_27,which we do in order to respond quickly should anything come up.
m_ex_matis_04_28,"But recently, Drake and Laplace"
m_ex_matis_04_29,have been so noisy while they sleep.
m_ex_matis_04_30,!!!
m_ex_matis_04_31,!!!
m_ex_matis_04_32,"How are they noisy, exactly?"
m_ex_matis_04_33,"For one thing,"
m_ex_matis_04_34,Laplace snores something awful.
m_ex_matis_04_35,"If I had to write it out, it'd be something like this:"
m_ex_matis_04_36,Drrrrrkkkkkkuahhh!!!
m_ex_matis_04_37,Phewww...
m_ex_matis_04_38,Drrrrrkkkkkkuahhh!!!!!!!!
m_ex_matis_04_39,Phewwwww...
m_ex_matis_04_40,Like that.
m_ex_matis_04_41,That was Laplace snoring?
m_ex_matis_04_42,I thought that was a construction crew working at night.
m_ex_matis_04_43,A hero that snores?
m_ex_matis_04_44,Unacceptable!
m_ex_matis_04_45,"You're no better, Drake."
m_ex_matis_04_46,You mean I snore as well?
m_ex_matis_04_47,"No, but you talk in your sleep."
m_ex_matis_04_48,"Everyone, hands up!! Make sure to raise your hands while crossing the road!"
m_ex_matis_04_49,Toss all your coins in this donation box!!
m_ex_matis_04_50,Stuff like that.
m_ex_matis_04_51,I knew it!
m_ex_matis_04_52,You talk like a hero in your sleep.
m_ex_matis_04_53,"That's all well and good,"
m_ex_matis_04_54,but all that yelling of hers wakes me up.
m_ex_matis_04_55,"If it's as bad as you make it out to be, it might be a good idea to switch to an individual room."
m_ex_matis_04_56,Do you think so?
m_ex_matis_04_57,Ha...
m_ex_matis_04_58,"Well,"
m_ex_matis_04_59,"since it's come to this,"
m_ex_matis_04_60,I'll have to find out what Maxwell's sleeping habits are as well.
m_ex_matis_04_61,That's a good idea.
m_ex_matis_04_62,I'd like to see you try.
m_ex_matis_04_63,I'm going to apply for an individual room.
m_ex_matis_05_1,I'd like to give a report on
m_ex_matis_05_2,Matis' recent activities.
m_ex_matis_05_3,Right now?
m_ex_matis_05_4,"If we're left to our own devices,"
m_ex_matis_05_5,we inevitably end up slacking on our reports.
m_ex_matis_05_6,Even I've forgotten about it a handful of times.
m_ex_matis_05_7,So I thought it might be better
m_ex_matis_05_8,"if we made our reports with you present, hehe."
m_ex_matis_05_9,I see.
m_ex_matis_05_10,Can we hurry this up?
m_ex_matis_05_11,I've got a villain's meeting arranged for us all right after this.
m_ex_matis_05_12,Okay okay.
m_ex_matis_05_13,"Laplace, are you ready?"
m_ex_matis_05_14,A hero is always ready!
m_ex_matis_05_15,Good.
m_ex_matis_05_16,Please summarize the activities
m_ex_matis_05_17,you've conducted over the past week and share them with us.
m_ex_matis_05_18,I'll start.
m_ex_matis_05_19,"Day 1: Conducted experiments with Cutey, with the expectance of increased firepower."
m_ex_matis_05_20,"Day 2: Continued experiments, contemplating further exploration."
m_ex_matis_05_21,"Day 3: Conducted firepower tests on the surface with Cutey, achieved a new record."
m_ex_matis_05_22,What?
m_ex_matis_05_23,All you did was conduct experiments with Birdie.
m_ex_matis_05_24,How unbecoming of a hero!
m_ex_matis_05_25,What a useless report.
m_ex_matis_05_26,You'll never become a proper villain at that rate.
m_ex_matis_05_27,This is a perfectly ordinary report!
m_ex_matis_05_28,"You guys share your reports, then."
m_ex_matis_05_29,Fine.
m_ex_matis_05_30,I'll tell you about my stupendous villainous activities.
m_ex_matis_05_31,"I noticed an empty can,"
m_ex_matis_05_32,I decided to use it as a projectile and totally jack up the garbage can.
m_ex_matis_05_33,So I picked it up and threw it with all my might.
m_ex_matis_05_34,It landed right inside the garbage can! You should have heard the sound it made.
m_ex_matis_05_35,What do you think about that?
m_ex_matis_05_36,Hmm...
m_ex_matis_05_37,All you did was pick up some garbage. That's a noble and heroic act.
m_ex_matis_05_38,"But wait, there's more!"
m_ex_matis_05_39,"There was a pesky little brat,"
m_ex_matis_05_40,and I popped some candy in his mouth that made a nice crackling sound when he ate it.
m_ex_matis_05_41,You should have seen his expression!
m_ex_matis_05_42,That was a kind thing you did for that child.
m_ex_matis_05_43,Very much so.
m_ex_matis_05_44,I think we've got the gist of Drake's report.
m_ex_matis_05_45,"Okay, Laplace, your turn."
m_ex_matis_05_46,All right.
m_ex_matis_05_47,Prepare to be blown away.
m_ex_matis_05_48,Day 1: I had a great day as a hero.
m_ex_matis_05_49,Day 2: I was even more heroic than yesterday.
m_ex_matis_05_50,Day 3: I was even more heroic than yesterday and the day before.
m_ex_matis_05_51,Day 4: I was more heroic than any other day!
m_ex_matis_05_52,Hmm...
m_ex_matis_05_53,I think this will be the last time I sit in for one of these sessions.
m_ex_matis_05_54,Hahaha.
m_ex_matis_05_55,I think so too.
m_ex_matis_05_56,"At any rate,"
m_ex_matis_05_57,let's just do the best we can in our respective positions.
m_ex_matis_05_58,Understood!
m_ex_matis_05_59,Then I shall begin my heroic patrol.
m_ex_matis_05_60,And I'm about to go commit some villainous deeds.
m_ex_matis_05_61,"As for me,"
m_ex_matis_05_62,I'm going to rest.
m_ex_matis_05_63,"Best of luck, everyone."
m_ex_matis_06_1,Birdie！
m_ex_matis_06_2,Listen to this!
m_ex_matis_06_3,"Ugh, she's at it again."
m_ex_matis_06_4,"Yesterday, we had a hero meeting at a barbeque restaurant."
m_ex_matis_06_5,The meeting I went to was a villain's meeting...
m_ex_matis_06_6,But there was a big problem!
m_ex_matis_06_7,Problem? What problem?
m_ex_matis_06_8,Everything went perfectly fine.
m_ex_matis_06_9,"It's you, Maxwell."
m_ex_matis_06_10,You're the problem.
m_ex_matis_06_11,I am??
m_ex_matis_06_12,She is?
m_ex_matis_06_13,That's right.
m_ex_matis_06_14,It's because of her that I couldn't concentrate during yesterday's meeting.
m_ex_matis_06_15,"On that, we can agree."
m_ex_matis_06_16,"She kept insisting that I eat more vegetables, and was piling them on my plate."
m_ex_matis_06_17,She even tried to feed me some against my will.
m_ex_matis_06_18,That's because you eat too much red meat.
m_ex_matis_06_19,It's important to eat a balanced meal.
m_ex_matis_06_20,"Isn't that right, Cutey?"
m_ex_matis_06_21,"You really should introduce more variety into your diet, Drake."
m_ex_matis_06_22,To only eat what you like is the most villainous thing of all.
m_ex_matis_06_23,Hmm... I guess you're right.
m_ex_matis_06_24,"Hey, it's important for villains to have a balanced diet too!"
m_ex_matis_06_25,And that's not all.
m_ex_matis_06_26,"I had this piece of meat on the grill that was a real beauty,"
m_ex_matis_06_27,then Maxwell went and flipped it over!
m_ex_matis_06_28,I had been taking plenty of good care of it without her butting in.
m_ex_matis_06_29,Says you.
m_ex_matis_06_30,"If I hadn't flipped that burger over, you would have ended up eating raw meat."
m_ex_matis_06_31,Food should always be cooked properly.
m_ex_matis_06_32,A hero needs to forever be ready to move out within a moment's notice.
m_ex_matis_06_33,Eating quickly is imperative.
m_ex_matis_06_34,...
m_ex_matis_06_35,"Well, what do you think, Cutey?"
m_ex_matis_06_36,Have I said anything that was out of line?
m_ex_matis_06_37,Doesn't seem like it.
m_ex_matis_06_38,I'm not finished yet!
m_ex_matis_06_39,There was also a mistake with the order.
m_ex_matis_06_40,There was?
m_ex_matis_06_41,You ordered 13 servings of meat.
m_ex_matis_06_42,How could the three of us handle that much meat?!
m_ex_matis_06_43,We only ended up eating half of it.
m_ex_matis_06_44,It's terrible to waste food like that.
m_ex_matis_06_45,"You're the one who placed the order, Drake."
m_ex_matis_06_46,"Oh yeah, I accidentally put a '1' before the '3'."
m_ex_matis_06_47,So it was you who fouled up!
m_ex_matis_06_48,"Villains do not ""foul up""!"
m_ex_matis_06_49,"Well, in the end, Maxwell didn't do anything wrong."
m_ex_matis_06_50,Exactly!
m_ex_matis_06_51,Really?
m_ex_matis_06_52,"If that's your take on it, Birdie, then there's not much I can do."
m_ex_matis_06_53,"Fine, I'll forgive you, Maxwell, just this once."
m_ex_matis_06_54,I'll never forgive you!
m_ex_matis_06_55,Ha...
m_ex_matis_06_56,Good luck dealing with these two.
m_ex_seraphim_03_1,Commander.
m_ex_seraphim_03_2,Can I talk to you for a moment?
m_ex_seraphim_03_3,"Pepper,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_4,this is a group chat.
m_ex_seraphim_03_5,"You didn't mistake it for a private conversation, did you?"
m_ex_seraphim_03_6,No!
m_ex_seraphim_03_7,I meant to send this in the group chat.
m_ex_seraphim_03_8,Oh?
m_ex_seraphim_03_9,So what is it?
m_ex_seraphim_03_10,"I personally feel that,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_11,"if for nothing else than the sake of reassuring their patients,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_12,doctors should themselves lead a healthy lifestyle.
m_ex_seraphim_03_13,"If you stretch yourself too thin and don't take care of yourself,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_14,"it'll end up showing in your physical appearance, and your bedside manner."
m_ex_seraphim_03_15,Wouldn't you both agree?
m_ex_seraphim_03_16,I'd say that's a valid point.
m_ex_seraphim_03_17,You're right.
m_ex_seraphim_03_18,"No matter how skilled a doctor is,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_19,"if they look like they're about to keel over,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_20,it won't be good for the patients' morale.
m_ex_seraphim_03_21,"That's a very perceptive observation, Pepper."
m_ex_seraphim_03_22,Mary...
m_ex_seraphim_03_23,Yes?
m_ex_seraphim_03_24,I was...
m_ex_seraphim_03_25,talking about you.
m_ex_seraphim_03_26,!!
m_ex_seraphim_03_27,"We've had a big influx of patients recently,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_28,but you've continued to work non-stop.
m_ex_seraphim_03_29,You've even been studying and giving lectures on holidays.
m_ex_seraphim_03_30,Have I?
m_ex_seraphim_03_31,Yes!
m_ex_seraphim_03_32,"Commander, say something."
m_ex_seraphim_03_33,"Doesn't that schedule make you exhausted, Mary?"
m_ex_seraphim_03_34,Hmm...
m_ex_seraphim_03_35,"It's something that I enjoy doing,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_36,so I've never felt the slightest bit tired.
m_ex_seraphim_03_37,"But if my appearance makes patients feel uneasy,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_38,then it definitely warrants further consideration.
m_ex_seraphim_03_39,How about taking a vacation?
m_ex_seraphim_03_40,I can't leave the patients behind.
m_ex_seraphim_03_41,Anything could happen while I'm gone.
m_ex_seraphim_03_42,"I'm here too, you know!"
m_ex_seraphim_03_43,But then you'll have to take on twice the work.
m_ex_seraphim_03_44,Er...
m_ex_seraphim_03_45,How about this...
m_ex_seraphim_03_46,"What have you got in mind, Commander?"
m_ex_seraphim_03_47,"Let's all regularly meet for tea in the hospital lounge, the three of us."
m_ex_seraphim_03_48,"Oooh,"
m_ex_seraphim_03_49,that's a lovely idea.
m_ex_seraphim_03_50,How about we start today?
m_ex_seraphim_03_51,That sounds wonderful!
m_ex_seraphim_03_52,I'll stop by the hospital after work.
m_ex_seraphim_03_53,Sounds good.
m_ex_seraphim_03_54,"Thank you, Commander!"
m_ex_seraphim_04_1,Commander. Pepper.
m_ex_seraphim_04_2,Are you two free?
m_ex_seraphim_04_3,"Sure, I've got time."
m_ex_seraphim_04_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_seraphim_04_5,"I want to create a certain something,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_6,and I'd like to hear your opinions.
m_ex_seraphim_04_7,"Are you talking about ""that""?"
m_ex_seraphim_04_8,I am.
m_ex_seraphim_04_9,"You mean ""that""?"
m_ex_seraphim_04_10,"What is ""that"", exactly?"
m_ex_seraphim_04_11,"Hehe, you don't even know what it is, Commander."
m_ex_seraphim_04_12,I would like to put on a simple play
m_ex_seraphim_04_13,for the young patients we have
m_ex_seraphim_04_14,who are hospitalized.
m_ex_seraphim_04_15,Interesting!
m_ex_seraphim_04_16,I knew you were talking about the play.
m_ex_seraphim_04_17,"We spoke about it once before,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_18,but we haven't made much headway since.
m_ex_seraphim_04_19,Do you have any specific plans?
m_ex_seraphim_04_20,"I was thinking something along the lines of good versus evil,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_21,with the hospital standing up against evil bacteria and defeating it.
m_ex_seraphim_04_22,"The only thing is, I need someone to play the superhero role."
m_ex_seraphim_04_23,"If a superhero is what you need, look no further than Matis."
m_ex_seraphim_04_24,"If you're going to make something action-packed, Cafe Sweety is who you want."
m_ex_seraphim_04_25,We can't do that.
m_ex_seraphim_04_26,"Laplace would destroy the hospital,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_27,"Drake would probably want to play the role of the bacteria,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_28,and I doubt Maxwell would have any interest in the first place.
m_ex_seraphim_04_29,We can't do that.
m_ex_seraphim_04_30,"Milk would end up destroying the whole set,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_31,"Frima would just sleep in the dressing room,"
m_ex_seraphim_04_32,and Sugar would probably come on stage while riding her motorcycle.
m_ex_seraphim_04_33,Hmm...
m_ex_seraphim_04_34,"If that's how it is, then..."
m_ex_seraphim_04_35,I think the Commander would be perfect for the role!
m_ex_seraphim_04_36,Can you help?
m_ex_seraphim_04_37,Of course.
m_ex_seraphim_04_38,"I knew we could count on you, Commander."
m_ex_seraphim_04_39,Thanks!
m_ex_seraphim_04_40,I'll let you know when and where we'll be having rehearsals.
m_ex_seraphim_04_41,Let's all work hard to put on the best show we possibly can.
m_ex_seraphim_04_42,All right!
m_ex_seraphim_05_1,"Guys,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_2,I'm concerned.
m_ex_seraphim_05_3,What is it?
m_ex_seraphim_05_4,The hospital gowns that our patients wear...
m_ex_seraphim_05_5,don't you think they're a bit unappealing?
m_ex_seraphim_05_6,I think they're quite comfortable.
m_ex_seraphim_05_7,"No one's saying they're not comfy,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_8,"but if you ask me, they focus too much on functionality."
m_ex_seraphim_05_9,"Meanwhile, the design has been left by the wayside. They're a major eyesore."
m_ex_seraphim_05_10,You may have a point.
m_ex_seraphim_05_11,"They make it very easy for us doctors to conduct our examinations,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_12,but they are rather dull.
m_ex_seraphim_05_13,"You've worn them on occasion,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_14,Commander.
m_ex_seraphim_05_15,What do you think of them?
m_ex_seraphim_05_16,Is design really all that important for hospital gowns?
m_ex_seraphim_05_17,"It may not be at the top of the list, no,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_18,"but hospitals are often places associated with fear and anxiety,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_19,so I want to reduce the stress for our patients as much as possible.
m_ex_seraphim_05_20,"That's very considerate of you, Pepper."
m_ex_seraphim_05_21,"It may not seem like much, but hospital gowns can absolutely evoke a certain atmosphere."
m_ex_seraphim_05_22,We could use them to help alleviate tension among the patients.
m_ex_seraphim_05_23,Exactly!
m_ex_seraphim_05_24,I'll brainstorm and come up with a few potential designs.
m_ex_seraphim_05_25,Really?
m_ex_seraphim_05_26,"You're going to help as well, Commander?"
m_ex_seraphim_05_27,"Sure, why not?"
m_ex_seraphim_05_28,Thank you!
m_ex_seraphim_05_29,Let me know if there's any way I can lend a hand.
m_ex_seraphim_05_30,I'll do whatever I can to help.
m_ex_seraphim_05_31,"I will,"
m_ex_seraphim_05_32,thank you both!
m_ex_alice_04_1,"Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_04_2,you can't die!
m_ex_alice_04_3,What am I gonna do?
m_ex_alice_04_4,I'm not dead.
m_ex_alice_04_5,"Maybe not now,"
m_ex_alice_04_6,but you will if you get lonely.
m_ex_alice_04_7,Who told you that?
m_ex_alice_04_8,That's what it said in this book Anis lent me.
m_ex_alice_04_9,"Rabbits get lonely super easily,"
m_ex_alice_04_10,and that causes them to die!
m_ex_alice_04_11,"Rabbity, you can't die!"
m_ex_alice_04_12,I'm not lonely when you're around.
m_ex_alice_04_13,"I'm not lonely, because I have my friends."
m_ex_alice_04_14,Oh!
m_ex_alice_04_15,Really?
m_ex_alice_04_16,Then I've got to stay with you
m_ex_alice_04_17,so that you don't ever die!
m_ex_alice_04_18,"Oh, that's right!"
m_ex_alice_04_19,You've got a whole bunch of friends fighting alongside you.
m_ex_alice_04_20,"In that case, you shouldn't be too lonely. That's a load of my mind."
m_ex_alice_04_21,"Just to make sure... you're not going to die, right?"
m_ex_alice_04_22,I'm not going anywhere.
m_ex_alice_04_23,That's a relief.
m_ex_alice_04_24,I was really scared for a second.
m_ex_alice_04_25,"What exactly is this book that you're reading, anyway?"
m_ex_alice_04_26,It was 101 facts about rabbits.
m_ex_alice_04_27,"Oh, that reminds me!"
m_ex_alice_04_28,"It is said that off on a faraway star, there are rabbits who make super delicious rice cakes."
m_ex_alice_04_29,I'd give anything to meet them.
m_ex_alice_04_30,I'm sure you'll be able to see them one day.
m_ex_alice_04_31,I hope you're right.
m_ex_alice_04_32,"Oh, Queen is calling. I've got to go."
m_ex_alice_04_33,See you around!
m_ex_alice_05_1,"Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_05_2,I'm curious about something.
m_ex_alice_05_3,What are you curious about?
m_ex_alice_05_4,Do you prefer tea or coffee?
m_ex_alice_05_5,Very bitter black coffee.
m_ex_alice_05_6,Cafe Sweety's sugar coffee.
m_ex_alice_05_7,"Okay, good to know!"
m_ex_alice_05_8,Wait a second.
m_ex_alice_05_9,Those are both coffee.
m_ex_alice_05_10,What makes you ask?
m_ex_alice_05_11,"I'm hosting a tea party,"
m_ex_alice_05_12,and wanted to invite you and Queen to attend.
m_ex_alice_05_13,A tea party?
m_ex_alice_05_14,Yep!
m_ex_alice_05_15,I'll prepare a bunch of delectable snacks that we can dig into
m_ex_alice_05_16,while we sip on our aromatic tea
m_ex_alice_05_17,and while the day away chatting.
m_ex_alice_05_18,Sounds fun.
m_ex_alice_05_19,Doesn't it?
m_ex_alice_05_20,I'm gonna go get started on preparing the snacks.
m_ex_alice_05_21,I'll send you an invitation as soon as I'm ready!
m_ex_alice_05_22,Sounds good.
m_ex_alice_05_23,"After some time has passed, Alice sends another message."
m_ex_alice_05_24,Uh...
m_ex_alice_05_25,Rabbity...
m_ex_alice_05_26,"I was making some baked goods,"
m_ex_alice_05_27,but there aren't any cute plates to put them on.
m_ex_alice_05_28,What should I do?
m_ex_alice_05_29,We can eat it with our hands.
m_ex_alice_05_30,Let's go buy some plates together.
m_ex_alice_05_31,But...
m_ex_alice_05_32,I was planning on making a cake as well.
m_ex_alice_05_33,Our hands will get filthy eating that.
m_ex_alice_05_34,Then let's go buy some plates together.
m_ex_alice_05_35,You'd do that for me?
m_ex_alice_05_36,What should we buy?
m_ex_alice_05_37,Let's spring for a cake stand.
m_ex_alice_05_38,What's that?
m_ex_alice_05_39,"It's a piece of tableware comprised of several plates stacked up, where you can place small snacks."
m_ex_alice_05_40,Whoa!
m_ex_alice_05_41,I wanna see that.
m_ex_alice_05_42,I'm heading in your direction right now.
m_ex_alice_05_43,"Okay, see you soon."
m_ex_alice_05_44,See ya!
m_ex_alice_06_1,"Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_06_2,does your butt light up?
m_ex_alice_06_3,Come again?
m_ex_alice_06_4,I'm just curious.
m_ex_alice_06_5,Does your butt light up?
m_ex_alice_06_6,I would say... no?
m_ex_alice_06_7,"I can't see, so I'm not sure."
m_ex_alice_06_8,"Yeah, probably not."
m_ex_alice_06_9,Most people's butts don't light up.
m_ex_alice_06_10,Ah!
m_ex_alice_06_11,Then...
m_ex_alice_06_12,I can't see my butt either.
m_ex_alice_06_13,Could it be lighting up too?
m_ex_alice_06_14,There's no way.
m_ex_alice_06_15,But I've heard of this creature up on the surface
m_ex_alice_06_16,whose butt lights up.
m_ex_alice_06_17,"It's a living organism, about as big as a fingernail."
m_ex_alice_06_18,"Once night falls,"
m_ex_alice_06_19,you can see a greenish-yellow light shining from its rear end.
m_ex_alice_06_20,Do you think such a creature truly exists?
m_ex_alice_06_21,You're talking about a firefly.
m_ex_alice_06_22,"Oh, is that what they're called?"
m_ex_alice_06_23,So you know what I'm talking about!
m_ex_alice_06_24,They emanate that light as part of their mating ritual.
m_ex_alice_06_25,"Wow,"
m_ex_alice_06_26,now that's something I'd love to see.
m_ex_alice_06_27,It'd be even better if you and Queen were there too.
m_ex_alice_06_28,"When we have time, we can all go looking for some fireflies together."
m_ex_alice_06_29,All right!
m_ex_alice_06_30,"But Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_06_31,"what's 'mating', exactly?"
m_ex_alice_06_32,... Would you look at that? A new mission just came up. Gotta go.
m_ex_alice_06_33,"Oh, okay."
m_ex_alice_06_34,"You can explain it to me next time, then."
m_ex_alice_06_35,... I'll try.
m_ex_blanc_04_1,"Pit Boss, are you busy?"
m_ex_blanc_04_2,I have a question.
m_ex_blanc_04_3,I'm free. What's up?
m_ex_blanc_04_4,"Noir and I just finished a performance,"
m_ex_blanc_04_5,and some of the audience members
m_ex_blanc_04_6,said that watching our show made them feel incredibly happy.
m_ex_blanc_04_7,"Of course, whenever Noir and I are on the stage,"
m_ex_blanc_04_8,"we hope that everyone has a good time,"
m_ex_blanc_04_9,but it was still a pleasant surprise to hear someone tell us in person how they felt.
m_ex_blanc_04_10,"Anyway, that got me thinking."
m_ex_blanc_04_11,Have you ever enjoyed yourself
m_ex_blanc_04_12,when you see us on stage?
m_ex_blanc_04_13,Of course.
m_ex_blanc_04_14,"Wow, really?"
m_ex_blanc_04_15,So you also felt happy!!
m_ex_blanc_04_16,"How do you feel, Blanc?"
m_ex_blanc_04_17,Huh?
m_ex_blanc_04_18,You mean when I dance?
m_ex_blanc_04_19,Yes.
m_ex_blanc_04_20,"Every time I dance,"
m_ex_blanc_04_21,I'm ecstatic.
m_ex_blanc_04_22,"I've got Noir there beside me,"
m_ex_blanc_04_23,"and you're always off-stage, cheering me on."
m_ex_blanc_04_24,To be able to dance in front of those who appreciate me
m_ex_blanc_04_25,is a privilege that always fills me with joy.
m_ex_blanc_04_26,I'd love to keep doing what I'm doing for forever.
m_ex_blanc_04_27,"I hope that, too."
m_ex_blanc_04_28,"Well, since we're your good luck charm,"
m_ex_blanc_04_29,we'll do our best to keep you happy going forward.
m_ex_blanc_04_30,Looking forward to it!
m_ex_blanc_05_1,Pit Boss!
m_ex_blanc_05_2,The world needs our luck!
m_ex_blanc_05_3,What does that mean?
m_ex_blanc_05_4,Everyone's talking about the new raffle that's going on.
m_ex_blanc_05_5,Haven't you heard?
m_ex_blanc_05_6,First I've heard of it.
m_ex_blanc_05_7,"I've heard, but I've already spent all my salary."
m_ex_blanc_05_8,No kidding!
m_ex_blanc_05_9,"Well, if you win the grand prize, you can get a week-long voucher for a 5-star hotel."
m_ex_blanc_05_10,"The hotel is incredibly expensive, and it's next-to-impossible to get reservations for it."
m_ex_blanc_05_11,I knew that you'd be in the know.
m_ex_blanc_05_12,But that's too bad about your salary...
m_ex_blanc_05_13,"The grand prize is a week-long voucher for a 5-star hotel,"
m_ex_blanc_05_14,so it's worth throwing your hat in the ring.
m_ex_blanc_05_15,"The hotel is incredibly expensive, and it's next-to-impossible to get reservations for it."
m_ex_blanc_05_16,I can see why people are abuzz about it.
m_ex_blanc_05_17,Why'd you come to me with this?
m_ex_blanc_05_18,"Because whenever we've gotten close,"
m_ex_blanc_05_19,our luck increases
m_ex_blanc_05_20,and all sorts of good things happen.
m_ex_blanc_05_21,"So I was thinking that we could go and try that raffle together, hehe."
m_ex_blanc_05_22,"Sure, let's go."
m_ex_blanc_05_23,All right!
m_ex_blanc_05_24,But only on one condition.
m_ex_blanc_05_25,Oh? What's that?
m_ex_blanc_05_26,Let's bring Noir with us.
m_ex_blanc_05_27,Ah! That's a great idea.
m_ex_blanc_05_28,I don't want to end up giving you all my luck
m_ex_blanc_05_29,and jinx myself.
m_ex_blanc_05_30,"Also, if Noir is with us,"
m_ex_blanc_05_31,that'll increase your luck twice as much!
m_ex_blanc_05_32,"However,"
m_ex_blanc_05_33,"if you win the top prize,"
m_ex_blanc_05_34,you've got to promise to take the two of us with you.
m_ex_blanc_05_35,Naturally.
m_ex_blanc_05_36,"Okay, then I'll call Noir"
m_ex_blanc_05_37,and make the plans.
m_ex_blanc_05_38,See you later!! Hehehe.
m_ex_blanc_06_1,Pit Boss!
m_ex_blanc_06_2,Have you heard about the new event coming to Coin Rush?
m_ex_blanc_06_3,We've been thinking of what could be a unique prize.
m_ex_blanc_06_4,Something like Noir and I granting a customer one wish.
m_ex_blanc_06_5,What do you think?
m_ex_blanc_06_6,Isn't that a bit broad?
m_ex_blanc_06_7,Unrealistic wishes aren't allowed.
m_ex_blanc_06_8,We've also set a condition that we can only grant wishes that we know we're able to fulfill.
m_ex_blanc_06_9,I think the customers will love that.
m_ex_blanc_06_10,"Me too, hehe."
m_ex_blanc_06_11,"The announcement was only made a few days ago,"
m_ex_blanc_06_12,but we're already being flooded with wish requests.
m_ex_blanc_06_13,There was one in particular
m_ex_blanc_06_14,that really threw me for a loop.
m_ex_blanc_06_15,Did someone ask if they could marry you?
m_ex_blanc_06_16,What is it?
m_ex_blanc_06_17,"Haha! There were a few of those,"
m_ex_blanc_06_18,but we of course filed that
m_ex_blanc_06_19,under our unrealistic wish category.
m_ex_blanc_06_20,The wish was
m_ex_blanc_06_21,to have Noir and I
m_ex_blanc_06_22,wear reverse bunny suits.
m_ex_blanc_06_23,!!
m_ex_blanc_06_24,But we have always been wearing bunny girl costumes.
m_ex_blanc_06_25,Why did they make such a strange wish?
m_ex_blanc_06_26,Do you know
m_ex_blanc_06_27,"what the ""reverse bunny suit"" is?"
m_ex_blanc_06_28,This wish is also unrealistic.
m_ex_blanc_06_29,Is it?
m_ex_blanc_06_30,"So you know what the reverse bunny suit is, don't you?"
m_ex_blanc_06_31,"Sorry, but I have something urgent to get."
m_ex_blanc_06_32,"Ahhhhhhhhh, Pit Boss!"
m_ex_blanc_06_33,I should refrain from contacting Blanc for a while.
m_ex_diesel_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_diesel_04_2,can you help me confirm something?
m_ex_diesel_04_3,What is it?
m_ex_diesel_04_4,"When I first joined with you,"
m_ex_diesel_04_5,I gave you some strawberry candy
m_ex_diesel_04_6,"as a friendly gesture, didn't I?"
m_ex_diesel_04_7,"Yes, you gave me a boatload of them."
m_ex_diesel_04_8,"A lot of time has passed since then, so I was wondering"
m_ex_diesel_04_9,if you've finished them yet?
m_ex_diesel_04_10,I finished them a long time ago.
m_ex_diesel_04_11,I shared them with the other Nikkes.
m_ex_diesel_04_12,"Wow, you did?"
m_ex_diesel_04_13,You must have really liked how they tasted.
m_ex_diesel_04_14,"I'm glad you enjoyed them, hehe!"
m_ex_diesel_04_15,"Oh, you did?"
m_ex_diesel_04_16,But that means you probably didn't get to have many for yourself.
m_ex_diesel_04_17,"Either way,"
m_ex_diesel_04_18,"I'm glad that others got to appreciate them, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_04_19,"Anyways, I take it that means"
m_ex_diesel_04_20,you're out of strawberry candies?
m_ex_diesel_04_21,That's right.
m_ex_diesel_04_22,"This is perfect timing, actually,"
m_ex_diesel_04_23,because I have a little surprise for you.
m_ex_diesel_04_24,I was thinking of trying my hand at making my own candies.
m_ex_diesel_04_25,No kidding.
m_ex_diesel_04_26,"Until now, all I've ever given out are strawberry candies,"
m_ex_diesel_04_27,but I was thinking about making something especially suited to your tastes.
m_ex_diesel_04_28,What kind of flavor would you like?
m_ex_diesel_04_29,Can you make grape candy?
m_ex_diesel_04_30,You don't have to give me more candy.
m_ex_diesel_04_31,"Sure, I can do grape-strawberry flavor."
m_ex_diesel_04_32,"They're going to be delicious, I just know it!"
m_ex_diesel_04_33,I guess you're tired of candy...
m_ex_diesel_04_34,How about I make you some strawberry-flavored soybean paste?
m_ex_diesel_04_35,Hmm...
m_ex_diesel_04_36,"Actually, now that I've taken everything you've said into consideration,"
m_ex_diesel_04_37,I think I'm going to make several different flavors
m_ex_diesel_04_38,"and send you a whole bunch of assorted candies, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_04_39,Wait a minute...
m_ex_diesel_04_40,I'll let you know when they're done!
m_ex_diesel_04_41,Diesel?
m_ex_diesel_04_42,"After that, I don't hear from Diesel for a long time."
m_ex_diesel_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_diesel_05_2,do you have a minute?
m_ex_diesel_05_3,"Yes, what is it?"
m_ex_diesel_05_4,I wanted to ask you a question:
m_ex_diesel_05_5,What is my
m_ex_diesel_05_6,most charming aspect?
m_ex_diesel_05_7,"Your long, sleek, black hair."
m_ex_diesel_05_8,Your impeccably clean and crisp blue uniform.
m_ex_diesel_05_9,Oh my goodness!
m_ex_diesel_05_10,"Thank you for saying that, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_05_11,"Even though that's the answer I wanted to hear,"
m_ex_diesel_05_12,"it's still a bit embarrassing to hear it in person, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_05_13,But my uniform doesn't have anything to do with me personally.
m_ex_diesel_05_14,They're just a set of clothes that anyone could wear.
m_ex_diesel_05_15,"Personally, I think my hair is my most alluring aspect, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_05_16,"A while back,"
m_ex_diesel_05_17,some customers told me I should cut my hair.
m_ex_diesel_05_18,They said it was too long and thought that it looked messy.
m_ex_diesel_05_19,What hairstyle you have is none of their business.
m_ex_diesel_05_20,"That's what I thought,"
m_ex_diesel_05_21,"but it is a bit on the long side, which makes it hard to manage sometimes."
m_ex_diesel_05_22,I was thinking of
m_ex_diesel_05_23,switching things up and snipping it a bit.
m_ex_diesel_05_24,"Okay, next question."
m_ex_diesel_05_25,What kind of hairstyle do you think is best?
m_ex_diesel_05_26,Long and straight black hair.
m_ex_diesel_05_27,Whatever is the best fit.
m_ex_diesel_05_28,Hmm...
m_ex_diesel_05_29,Are you only saying that because I'm here?
m_ex_diesel_05_30,I guess you're right.
m_ex_diesel_05_31,It's all about what look suits you.
m_ex_diesel_05_32,"So, if I'm reading you correctly,"
m_ex_diesel_05_33,are you saying that my current hairstyle is what suits me best?
m_ex_diesel_05_34,Yes. It's perfect for you.
m_ex_diesel_05_35,"Hehe, really?"
m_ex_diesel_05_36,"Thanks for restoring my confidence, Commander."
m_ex_diesel_05_37,I'll stick with my long hair
m_ex_diesel_05_38,just as it is.
m_ex_diesel_06_1,Commander!
m_ex_diesel_06_2,"I know this is sudden,"
m_ex_diesel_06_3,but there's somewhere I want to go with you.
m_ex_diesel_06_4,Where is it?
m_ex_diesel_06_5,It's a place where they have what people are calling precision karaoke.
m_ex_diesel_06_6,Apparently it's all the rage lately.
m_ex_diesel_06_7,Is that different from regular karaoke?
m_ex_diesel_06_8,Of course.
m_ex_diesel_06_9,"Ordinary karaoke is all well and good,"
m_ex_diesel_06_10,but precision karaoke
m_ex_diesel_06_11,analyzes the singer's intonation and pitch in great detail.
m_ex_diesel_06_12,"It then takes those factors, and others, into consideration,"
m_ex_diesel_06_13,and gives you a score that indicates your musical ability.
m_ex_diesel_06_14,I thought it would be fun if you and I went.
m_ex_diesel_06_15,Why don't you ask the Prima Donna Squad?
m_ex_diesel_06_16,No way! They're all professional singers.
m_ex_diesel_06_17,I
m_ex_diesel_06_18,wanted to go up against you.
m_ex_diesel_06_19,But I can't carry a tune to save my life.
m_ex_diesel_06_20,Prepare to be amazed by my golden voice.
m_ex_diesel_06_21,So what?
m_ex_diesel_06_22,It's only going to be me listening.
m_ex_diesel_06_23,"Oh my, such confidence!"
m_ex_diesel_06_24,"I'm looking forward to this, hehe."
m_ex_diesel_06_25,Will this be your first time going?
m_ex_diesel_06_26,"Oh, hehe..."
m_ex_diesel_06_27,"Actually, I went by myself a couple of days ago."
m_ex_diesel_06_28,What was your score?
m_ex_diesel_06_29,Lol
m_ex_diesel_06_30,9 points.
m_ex_diesel_06_31,Isn't that amazing?
m_ex_diesel_06_32,9 out of 10 is pretty darn good!
m_ex_diesel_06_33,I think it may have been out of 100...
m_ex_diesel_06_34,We should go together next time.
m_ex_diesel_06_35,"Okay, let's do that."
m_ex_drake_04_1,Hey!
m_ex_drake_04_2,It's time for the meeting.
m_ex_drake_04_3,What meeting?
m_ex_drake_04_4,"What else, you dunce?"
m_ex_drake_04_5,The reporting of evil deeds for the Villain Union.
m_ex_drake_04_6,"If I don't submit a report of my evil deeds on a regular basis,"
m_ex_drake_04_7,I might accidentally become righteous without even realizing it.
m_ex_drake_04_8,That's why it's imperative that I hold these meetings.
m_ex_drake_04_9,Then allow me to commit an evil act and ignore this meeting.
m_ex_drake_04_10,"Hey, you shouldn't ignore people!"
m_ex_drake_04_11,"Now, listen to what I have to say."
m_ex_drake_04_12,Fine.
m_ex_drake_04_13,That's more like it.
m_ex_drake_04_14,"Okay, here's a breakdown of all my heinous acts this week:"
m_ex_drake_04_15,There was a frail old lady asking where she could find a bank
m_ex_drake_04_16,because she urgently had to withdraw 3 million Credits.
m_ex_drake_04_17,"Apparently her son had called and said that his phone was broken,"
m_ex_drake_04_18,and had asked for some money to fix it.
m_ex_drake_04_19,"So, did you rough up her son?"
m_ex_drake_04_20,What are you talking about?
m_ex_drake_04_21,I just bought her a new phone.
m_ex_drake_04_22,That meant the old lady would never be able to find the bank!
m_ex_drake_04_23,"Not only that, but I successfully deprived the phone shop of 3 million Credits,"
m_ex_drake_04_24,which leaves them in the lurch!
m_ex_drake_04_25,"... Well done, I suppose."
m_ex_drake_04_26,"Besides, how come fixing your phone ends up being more expensive than just getting a new one?"
m_ex_drake_04_27,How much sense does that make?
m_ex_drake_04_28,None. It was clearly a scam.
m_ex_drake_04_29,"Anyways,"
m_ex_drake_04_30,"I committed a whole bunch of other evil deeds,"
m_ex_drake_04_31,but none of them seemed to have much impact.
m_ex_drake_04_32,The only thing people ever did was thank me!
m_ex_drake_04_33,I still have a ways to go before I become a true blue villain.
m_ex_drake_04_34,Keep at it.
m_ex_drake_04_35,I will.
m_ex_drake_04_36,And the same to you!
m_ex_drake_05_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_drake_05_2,are you free?
m_ex_drake_05_3,A villain shouldn't care whether someone else is busy or not.
m_ex_drake_05_4,"Sorry, but I'm busy. We can talk later."
m_ex_drake_05_5,But it'd bum me out if I were to say what I wanted to say
m_ex_drake_05_6,and didn't hear a response from you.
m_ex_drake_05_7,Don't lie to me!
m_ex_drake_05_8,I only sent you a message
m_ex_drake_05_9,after confirming your schedule with Rapi.
m_ex_drake_05_10,"Anyway,"
m_ex_drake_05_11,do you go to the movies often?
m_ex_drake_05_12,I go whenever I'm interested in what's playing.
m_ex_drake_05_13,You don't say...
m_ex_drake_05_14,Then allow me to elucidate to you
m_ex_drake_05_15,on a few villainous acts you can commit in a movie theater.
m_ex_drake_05_16,"First,"
m_ex_drake_05_17,you'll need to buy some buttered popcorn and some candy.
m_ex_drake_05_18,Why?
m_ex_drake_05_19,"How can you not know, you idiot?"
m_ex_drake_05_20,It's an assault on the senses.
m_ex_drake_05_21,"When the pleasant rattling of that candy in the box hits their ears,"
m_ex_drake_05_22,"and the fresh smell of popcorn hits their nostrils,"
m_ex_drake_05_23,it will be torture for the other moviegoers who didn't buy anything.
m_ex_drake_05_24,They'll probably have to run out in the middle of the movie to go buy something.
m_ex_drake_05_25,That'll surprise the theater employees for sure!
m_ex_drake_05_26,Mwahahahaha!
m_ex_drake_05_27,...
m_ex_drake_05_28,Another question:
m_ex_drake_05_29,Do you get up right after the end of the movie?
m_ex_drake_05_30,"No, I usually stay to see if there's anything after the credits."
m_ex_drake_05_31,"Yes, I usually leave once the credits start."
m_ex_drake_05_32,"Ah yes, you're clearly in the know."
m_ex_drake_05_33,But then you're blocking the screen for anyone who's sitting behind you!
m_ex_drake_05_34,A true villain must sit and wait until the very end.
m_ex_drake_05_35,Do you want to know why?
m_ex_drake_05_36,Not really.
m_ex_drake_05_37,"That way, your seat will remain warm,"
m_ex_drake_05_38,"and whenever the next person comes in to sit down,"
m_ex_drake_05_39,they'll be totally grossed out at how uncomfortably warm it is!
m_ex_drake_05_40,Uh-huh.
m_ex_drake_05_41,"Most importantly,"
m_ex_drake_05_42,"while you're sitting there waiting and watching the credits,"
m_ex_drake_05_43,you can memorize the names of the cast and crew.
m_ex_drake_05_44,"Then, if you didn't like the movie,"
m_ex_drake_05_45,you can curse them using their real names!
m_ex_drake_05_46,Mwahahaha!
m_ex_drake_05_47,What a marvelously malicious scheme! It's enough to make even my blood run cold.
m_ex_drake_05_48,"Quickly, we must put this plan into action. To the movie theater!"
m_ex_drake_05_49,"Meet me there, and don't be late! Mwahahaha!"
m_ex_drake_06_1,Mwahahaha!
m_ex_drake_06_2,Today is our scheduled meeting for the Villain Union.
m_ex_drake_06_3,"Hear me, all of you, and tremble with excitement!"
m_ex_drake_06_4,All hail the world's greatest villain!
m_ex_drake_06_5,I can hardly wait!
m_ex_drake_06_6,Silence! I haven't even started yet.
m_ex_drake_06_7,You're embarrassing me.
m_ex_drake_06_8,Sorry.
m_ex_drake_06_9,"All right, I'll begin. A week ago,"
m_ex_drake_06_10,"I was walking around, seeing what trouble I could cause,"
m_ex_drake_06_11,"when lo and behold, I found a wallet on the ground."
m_ex_drake_06_12,Did you take it for yourself?
m_ex_drake_06_13,Did you leave it?
m_ex_drake_06_14,!!!
m_ex_drake_06_15,Do you not know anything?
m_ex_drake_06_16,Taking someone else's property is the worst thing you can possibly do.
m_ex_drake_06_17,"Of course not! If I did that, someone else could have taken it."
m_ex_drake_06_18,I took it to the nearest police station.
m_ex_drake_06_19,"At this very moment,"
m_ex_drake_06_20,"the owner is probably wandering the streets, unable to find it."
m_ex_drake_06_21,Mwahahaha!
m_ex_drake_06_22,I'm sure they'll end up finding it eventually.
m_ex_drake_06_23,"If you think that's impressive, this will knock your socks off."
m_ex_drake_06_24,...
m_ex_drake_06_25,"Actually, I'm debating whether I should tell you this or not."
m_ex_drake_06_26,What is it?
m_ex_drake_06_27,Just don't freak out.
m_ex_drake_06_28,Remember how we ran into each other yesterday?
m_ex_drake_06_29,Yes.
m_ex_drake_06_30,And we had a pretty long conversation?
m_ex_drake_06_31,"It was mostly you doing the talking, but sure."
m_ex_drake_06_32,Well...
m_ex_drake_06_33,Your fly was open the entire time.
m_ex_drake_06_34,?!
m_ex_drake_06_35,Hahahaha!
m_ex_drake_06_36,"Despite the inordinate amount of pleasure I get from seeing you so embarrassed,"
m_ex_drake_06_37,"for the sake of everyone else around you,"
m_ex_drake_06_38,I suggest you double-check your zipper next time you're in public.
m_ex_drake_06_39,... Noted.
m_ex_helm_04_1,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_helm_04_2,there's something I wanted to ask you.
m_ex_helm_04_3,Is this a good time?
m_ex_helm_04_4,"Sure, shoot."
m_ex_helm_04_5,Okay.
m_ex_helm_04_6,I wanted to ask
m_ex_helm_04_7,what kind of women's clothing do you prefer.
m_ex_helm_04_8,Could you be more precise?
m_ex_helm_04_9,Sure.
m_ex_helm_04_10,"Are you more of a fan of casual sportswear,"
m_ex_helm_04_11,or something frilly and cute?
m_ex_helm_04_12,"Maybe something clean-cut, like a pantsuit?"
m_ex_helm_04_13,Or...
m_ex_helm_04_14,"Sharp, meticulously crafted military uniforms?"
m_ex_helm_04_15,The most important thing is wearing whatever suits you.
m_ex_helm_04_16,"By that,"
m_ex_helm_04_17,do you mean the answer depends on the individual?
m_ex_helm_04_18,Exactly.
m_ex_helm_04_19,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_04_20,Is something the matter?
m_ex_helm_04_21,"No, nothing like that, but..."
m_ex_helm_04_22,"You know how it costs a fortune to maintain the Admire, don't you?"
m_ex_helm_04_23,"All the donations we scrap together aren't enough,"
m_ex_helm_04_24,so I often end up chipping in some of my own salary to cover the costs.
m_ex_helm_04_25,"Because of that, I don't really have the luxury of treating myself to any nice clothing."
m_ex_helm_04_26,I'm sure you've noticed how I tend to wear either the same old military uniform
m_ex_helm_04_27,or other clothes that are donated.
m_ex_helm_04_28,Anyway... how should I put this...
m_ex_helm_04_29,I was wondering if dressing up nice
m_ex_helm_04_30,can make you have a more commanding presence.
m_ex_helm_04_31,I think the way you look now is perfect.
m_ex_helm_04_32,Really?
m_ex_helm_04_33,"I mean, I'm a fan of military uniforms, so I really don't have any complaints."
m_ex_helm_04_34,"Still, shouldn't I at least buy a few other outfits just in case?"
m_ex_helm_04_35,We can go pick out some together.
m_ex_helm_04_36,You and me?
m_ex_helm_04_37,Sure. I'll help you pick out the ones that look good on you.
m_ex_helm_04_38,I'd be so grateful if you did.
m_ex_helm_04_39,"I have no fashion sense whatsoever,"
m_ex_helm_04_40,so I'd be helpless otherwise.
m_ex_helm_04_41,"I'll get in touch with you on my next day off,"
m_ex_helm_04_42,and thank you for hearing me out.
m_ex_helm_05_1,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_helm_05_2,I wanted to ask your opinion on something
m_ex_helm_05_3,that would be a bit difficult to discuss with anyone else.
m_ex_helm_05_4,It's about the future of the Admire and the Aegis Squad.
m_ex_helm_05_5,Is this about money?
m_ex_helm_05_6,I don't have any money to lend to you.
m_ex_helm_05_7,It is.
m_ex_helm_05_8,You're as perceptive as always.
m_ex_helm_05_9,You're as perceptive as always. No surprise there.
m_ex_helm_05_10,But you mustn't worry about that.
m_ex_helm_05_11,I wouldn't dream of asking you for money.
m_ex_helm_05_12,I wanted to talk to you about the donations that we're receiving.
m_ex_helm_05_13,Has less money been coming in?
m_ex_helm_05_14,"No, the amount of our patrons hasn't changed,"
m_ex_helm_05_15,"but it's just that with the recession nowadays,"
m_ex_helm_05_16,donations have taken a sharp decline.
m_ex_helm_05_17,Even the affluent citizens of the Ark
m_ex_helm_05_18,are hesitant to loosen their purse strings without good reason.
m_ex_helm_05_19,"But in order to maintain the Admire,"
m_ex_helm_05_20,I have to keep money coming in.
m_ex_helm_05_21,"So, I was wondering"
m_ex_helm_05_22,if you had any good methods where I could collect donations?
m_ex_helm_05_23,"If you want me to lend you money, just ask."
m_ex_helm_05_24,What if you invest everything in a lottery?
m_ex_helm_05_25,"It's not that, truly."
m_ex_helm_05_26,It wouldn't feel right to take money from you.
m_ex_helm_05_27,"So gambling, essentially?"
m_ex_helm_05_28,I can't do something dangerous like that
m_ex_helm_05_29,Then what about crowdfunding?
m_ex_helm_05_30,Crowdfunding?
m_ex_helm_05_31,What's that?
m_ex_helm_05_32,It's a fundraising method using the internet.
m_ex_helm_05_33,Are you sure about this?
m_ex_helm_05_34,It sounds illegal to me.
m_ex_helm_05_35,It's 100% legal.
m_ex_helm_05_36,Really?
m_ex_helm_05_37,Can you explain in more detail?
m_ex_helm_05_38,"All you have to do is make a website, then enter the reason why you're raising the money, and the amount required."
m_ex_helm_05_39,I see.
m_ex_helm_05_40,And then what?
m_ex_helm_05_41,You just wait until you reach the target you set.
m_ex_helm_05_42,Is that all?
m_ex_helm_05_43,That sounds much easier than I thought it'd be.
m_ex_helm_05_44,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_05_45,"Still, I'm not familiar with any of this stuff."
m_ex_helm_05_46,Is it okay if I ask you to help me later on?
m_ex_helm_05_47,Absolutely. Call me anytime.
m_ex_helm_05_48,"Thanks, Subordinate."
m_ex_helm_05_49,I'm glad I came to you for advice.
m_ex_helm_05_50,I'll come find you once our next fundraiser on the Admire ends.
m_ex_helm_05_51,Okay.
m_ex_helm_06_1,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_helm_06_2,my body has been feeling strange lately.
m_ex_helm_06_3,Is there any way I can get to the bottom of this?
m_ex_helm_06_4,How exactly does your body feel strange?
m_ex_helm_06_5,"It's hard to explain,"
m_ex_helm_06_6,"but everything just feels different ever since I came back from the hot spring,"
m_ex_helm_06_7,and I have no idea why.
m_ex_helm_06_8,This has never happened before.
m_ex_helm_06_9,Could you give me a few more details?
m_ex_helm_06_10,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_06_11,"First, my joint mobility has increased."
m_ex_helm_06_12,"Also, my skin used to be a walking disaster since all our training maneuvers were done in seawater,"
m_ex_helm_06_13,"but now my skin has become as smooth as a baby's bottom,"
m_ex_helm_06_14,and the bruises on my body
m_ex_helm_06_15,"have all disappeared as well,"
m_ex_helm_06_16,along with all aches and pains.
m_ex_helm_06_17,Hmm...
m_ex_helm_06_18,What could be the reason for all of this?
m_ex_helm_06_19,The results from my latest maintenance report
m_ex_helm_06_20,indicated no abnormalities.
m_ex_helm_06_21,I think you can chalk this all up to the hot spring.
m_ex_helm_06_22,You mean the hot spring is responsible for all this?
m_ex_helm_06_23,"Your muscles that were once tensed up are now relaxed, and your skin has improved."
m_ex_helm_06_24,"Ah,"
m_ex_helm_06_25,I get it now.
m_ex_helm_06_26,The hot springs have a positive effect on the body.
m_ex_helm_06_27,And they seem to be pretty effective at that. I should pay a visit soon.
m_ex_helm_06_28,"Subordinate,"
m_ex_helm_06_29,how about we go together?
m_ex_helm_06_30,I want to learn more about the effects they have.
m_ex_helm_06_31,Sure thing.
m_ex_laplace_04_1,Birdie!
m_ex_laplace_04_2,Are you available?
m_ex_laplace_04_3,I'm busy.
m_ex_laplace_04_4,"Sorry, I'm not available at the moment."
m_ex_laplace_04_5,"Perfect, I knew you'd have time for me."
m_ex_laplace_04_6,That's not what I said...
m_ex_laplace_04_7,Do you remember that rescue operation we did together?
m_ex_laplace_04_8,The one with the fire.
m_ex_laplace_04_9,"If you recall, one of the people we rescued was a little girl."
m_ex_laplace_04_10,I remember.
m_ex_laplace_04_11,"Well,"
m_ex_laplace_04_12,that little girl sent a package to Matis.
m_ex_laplace_04_13,However!
m_ex_laplace_04_14,A hero should never expect a reward for saving the weak and defenseless.
m_ex_laplace_04_15,It is simply something we do because it is right.
m_ex_laplace_04_16,So what'd you do with the package?
m_ex_laplace_04_17,"On the other hand, rejecting a gift someone has given out of gratitude"
m_ex_laplace_04_18,is far from heroic as well.
m_ex_laplace_04_19,...
m_ex_laplace_04_20,"So, I'm about to open the package."
m_ex_laplace_04_21,"However, since you were also a part of this operation,"
m_ex_laplace_04_22,I wanted to contact you first so that we can share this special moment together.
m_ex_laplace_04_23,That's very nice of you.
m_ex_laplace_04_24,"All right then, I'm gonna open it!"
m_ex_laplace_04_25,I wonder what's inside...
m_ex_laplace_04_26,A massive amount of credits that I'd have no use for?
m_ex_laplace_04_27,Or perhaps a gargantuan bar of Splendamin that I wouldn't be able to finish in a lifetime?
m_ex_laplace_04_28,"Well, what's inside?"
m_ex_laplace_04_29,Oh...
m_ex_laplace_04_30,It's a letter that reads:
m_ex_laplace_04_31,Thank you for saving me.
m_ex_laplace_04_32,"Despite us losing all of our possessions in the fire,"
m_ex_laplace_04_33,"I now have a new dream,"
m_ex_laplace_04_34,which is to be just like Laplace.
m_ex_laplace_04_35,I want to become a cool hero who saves others too.
m_ex_laplace_04_36,Be careful out there fighting the bad guys.
m_ex_laplace_04_37,That's the best gift anyone could ask for.
m_ex_laplace_04_38,... Are you crying?
m_ex_laplace_04_39,A human should hardly be concerned for a hero's safety...
m_ex_laplace_04_40,A hero never cries!
m_ex_laplace_04_41,"But since she took the time to write this letter,"
m_ex_laplace_04_42,I should keep it safe.
m_ex_laplace_04_43,Do you have any spare picture frames lying around?
m_ex_laplace_04_44,I might.
m_ex_laplace_04_45,"If you do, let me borrow one,"
m_ex_laplace_04_46,and I'll put this on the nightstand beside my bed.
m_ex_laplace_04_47,"Hehe, okay."
m_ex_laplace_05_1,"Birdie,"
m_ex_laplace_05_2,I wanted to find a human to ask a question.
m_ex_laplace_05_3,What is it?
m_ex_laplace_05_4,"I was watching Ark Rangers on TV,"
m_ex_laplace_05_5,"and while it's totally unrealistic,"
m_ex_laplace_05_6,there were some things that I could take away from it.
m_ex_laplace_05_7,Like not breaking windows every time you make an entrance?
m_ex_laplace_05_8,Shattering a window is imperative
m_ex_laplace_05_9,if you want to make a flashy entrance.
m_ex_laplace_05_10,That's why people have installed so many of them everywhere.
m_ex_laplace_05_11,... Uh-huh.
m_ex_laplace_05_12,"Anyway, back to what I wanted to ask you."
m_ex_laplace_05_13,The Ark Rangers all came in different colors:
m_ex_laplace_05_14,"Red is the leader, Blue is the cool and collected one,"
m_ex_laplace_05_15,"Black is the strongest physically, Yellow is the easiest on the eyes, and Pink is the youngest."
m_ex_laplace_05_16,I think distinguishing by color like this
m_ex_laplace_05_17,is a pretty solid idea.
m_ex_laplace_05_18,"So, my question is:"
m_ex_laplace_05_19,What do you think my color would be?
m_ex_laplace_05_20,"Red, naturally."
m_ex_laplace_05_21,"I'm hoping you can calm down a bit, so blue."
m_ex_laplace_05_22,Is that so?
m_ex_laplace_05_23,"Very interesting,"
m_ex_laplace_05_24,but I'm afraid you're wrong.
m_ex_laplace_05_25,Why?
m_ex_laplace_05_26,Because
m_ex_laplace_05_27,I am a hero who possesses traits from all the colors.
m_ex_laplace_05_28,"Calm, strong, never settling for less, cute as a button, and a born leader."
m_ex_laplace_05_29,You see? I'm all the colors!
m_ex_laplace_05_30,Haha!
m_ex_laplace_05_31,"But if you were to combine all the colors, you'd end up with black. So does that make your color black?"
m_ex_laplace_05_32,"Oh,"
m_ex_laplace_05_33,is that how it works?
m_ex_laplace_05_34,"Then I guess from now on, I'm Laplace, the black hero!"
m_ex_laplace_05_35,Out!
m_ex_laplace_06_1,La
m_ex_laplace_06_2,pla
m_ex_laplace_06_3,ce
m_ex_laplace_06_4,!!!
m_ex_laplace_06_5,Enter!!!!!!!!!!!!!
m_ex_laplace_06_6,You're quite a livewire today.
m_ex_laplace_06_7,I'm glad you picked up on that!
m_ex_laplace_06_8,I've felt like my entries
m_ex_laplace_06_9,"have started to become a little stale,"
m_ex_laplace_06_10,so I've been thinking about various new ways I can make an entrance.
m_ex_laplace_06_11,Is breaking windows not dramatic enough already?
m_ex_laplace_06_12,The fact that you're even asking is a clear indication that there's a problem.
m_ex_laplace_06_13,Sometimes you really need some pizazz.
m_ex_laplace_06_14,"Y'know, a bit of the ol' razzle dazzle!"
m_ex_laplace_06_15,"So, I've come up with something."
m_ex_laplace_06_16,What is it?
m_ex_laplace_06_17,"Next time we go on a mission,"
m_ex_laplace_06_18,"I'll enter while spinning in circles dramatically,"
m_ex_laplace_06_19,"all while screaming,"
m_ex_laplace_06_20,Heroic entrance!
m_ex_laplace_06_21,at the top of my lungs.
m_ex_laplace_06_22,That's where I'll need your help.
m_ex_laplace_06_23,"While I'm shouting,"
m_ex_laplace_06_24,you'll have to push a button for me.
m_ex_laplace_06_25,What happens then?
m_ex_laplace_06_26,Hahaha!
m_ex_laplace_06_27,"The explosives I've buried beforehand will detonate,"
m_ex_laplace_06_28,and then the real fireworks will begin.
m_ex_laplace_06_29,"A superhero, walking epically through the fire!"
m_ex_laplace_06_30,"Just imagine, me striding along, backlit by the towering flames filling the area."
m_ex_laplace_06_31,How amazing would that be?
m_ex_laplace_06_32,... Laplace.
m_ex_laplace_06_33,Yes?
m_ex_laplace_06_34,Why would you want to cause even more havoc at the scene of an accident?
m_ex_laplace_06_35,...
m_ex_laplace_06_36,You may have a point.
m_ex_laplace_06_37,That might be why Maxwell rejected it.
m_ex_laplace_06_38,"Okay, how about we ditch the explosives and go for actual fireworks instead of metaphorical ones?"
m_ex_laplace_06_39,I suggest you scrap it and think of something else.
m_ex_liter_04_1,Greenhorn.
m_ex_liter_04_2,I can't believe it!
m_ex_liter_04_3,What?
m_ex_liter_04_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_liter_04_5,You haven't made any typos.
m_ex_liter_04_6,That's right.
m_ex_liter_04_7,"Anyway,"
m_ex_liter_04_8,Volt is much smarter now.
m_ex_liter_04_9,He used to be a real handful.
m_ex_liter_04_10,You can't imagine how tough it was training him.
m_ex_liter_04_11,Why are you bringing up Volt all of a sudden?
m_ex_liter_04_12,Just listen for a second.
m_ex_liter_04_13,"But after all that blood, sweat, and tears,"
m_ex_liter_04_14,"all those knock-down, drag-out fights and heart-to-hearts,"
m_ex_liter_04_15,Volt has become the fantastic pooch that he is today.
m_ex_liter_04_16,It's the same thing with texting.
m_ex_liter_04_17,"So long as I keep at it, there won't be any typpppp"
m_ex_liter_04_18,an dty using
m_ex_liter_04_19,U h

m_ex_liter_05_23,Taste it and teeell me what syo think.
m_ex_liter_05_24,It's a bit bland... and bitter.
m_ex_liter_05_25,"Okay, good."
m_ex_liter_05_26,I'll make ma memmo.
m_ex_liter_05_27,Now try thee seconad cann.
m_ex_liter_05_28,It has a pleasantly meaty flavor.

m_ex_liter_05_33,Sooo how does it tastttee?
m_ex_liter_05_34,"This one's also on the bland side, but it's nice and savory."

m_ex_liter_05_40,"Whoops, anooother ttypooo."
m_ex_liter_05_41,"Soo, how's the eateaste?"
m_ex_liter_05_42,It's kind of glutonous.
m_ex_liter_05_43,"I'm noat abking about the texture,"
m_ex_liter_05_44,I care about the aflavor.
m_ex_liter_05_45,"It smells appetizing, but it tastes bland and soupy."
m_ex_liter_05_46,I seeee!
m_ex_liter_05_47,Thenn whichh onen iss the best?
m_ex_liter_05_48,"I wasn't a fan of how bitter it was, but I'd still say number 1."
m_ex_liter_05_49,"The savory meat one, number 2."
m_ex_liter_05_50,"The soupy one, number 3."
m_ex_liter_05_51,Y-eyes gogood
m_ex_liter_05_52,We'll gavie that one to Volt.
m_ex_liter_05_53,Come again?
m_ex_liter_05_54,Youu didn't read it wrongg.
m_ex_liter_05_55,What youu just ate
m_ex_liter_05_56,were premium sammpples foro pets.
m_ex_liter_05_57,"Sure, it's typicalyl meant for aimals,"
m_ex_liter_05_58,but they're perfvlty okay fo hummanas to eattt.
m_ex_liter_05_59,I immediately stop texting with Liter and run to the bathroom.
m_ex_liter_06_1,Greeenehorn.
m_ex_liter_06_2,I ahvea something to askkk.
m_ex_liter_06_3,What is it?
m_ex_liter_06_4,I've notceioed sometihg recently
m_ex_liter_06_5,whenver I tlk to Volt.
m_ex_liter_06_6,I was woindering
m_ex_liter_06_7,if thers' asometing weird about how I speak?
m_ex_liter_06_8,You've always had an unusual way of speaking.
m_ex_liter_06_9,Whwhat?!
m_ex_liter_06_10,There's nothing wrongg with howw I talkk!
m_ex_liter_06_11,"Anyway, whenvre I talkkk to Volt,"
m_ex_liter_06_12,I end up talkingg like a kidd withoutt realizingg it.
m_ex_liter_06_13,What do you mean?
m_ex_liter_06_14,Haven't you ever noitecd
m_ex_liter_06_15,"when paeople talk to their petts,"
m_ex_liter_06_16,they stay stuff lik.e:
m_ex_liter_06_17,"oooooh, hta's a good boy!"
m_ex_liter_06_18,Gives me a kissie-poo!
m_ex_liter_06_19,"I didn't knowww why,"
m_ex_liter_06_20,"but ever since Centi ppointed this poitu to me,"
m_ex_liter_06_21,I've felt a bit self-conciosiu about how I do that.
m_ex_liter_06_22,I wanttt to fixxx it.
m_ex_liter_06_23,There's nothing to fix.
m_ex_liter_06_24,??
m_ex_liter_06_25,Talking that way is part of showing your affection.
m_ex_liter_06_26,I seeee...
m_ex_liter_06_27,Then...
m_ex_liter_06_28,"Aww, what a good boyyy you are!"
m_ex_liter_06_29,Atta boy!
m_ex_liter_06_30,Don't use it on me!
m_ex_mary_04_1,Knock knock!
m_ex_mary_04_2,Knock knock knock!
m_ex_mary_04_3,Who's there?
m_ex_mary_04_4,I don't have time for this.
m_ex_mary_04_5,"Aw, come now, Commander, don't be like that!"
m_ex_mary_04_6,I was just trying out a harmless knock-knock joke.
m_ex_mary_04_7,No need to get grumpy.
m_ex_mary_04_8,"It's me, Mary!"
m_ex_mary_04_9,"I'm reaching out because last time when you came in for a checkup,"
m_ex_mary_04_10,I noticed something after examining your back.
m_ex_mary_04_11,Is there something wrong?
m_ex_mary_04_12,Hmmm...
m_ex_mary_04_13,Have you been experiencing any stiffness in your shoulders recently?
m_ex_mary_04_14,Or back pain?
m_ex_mary_04_15,"If you would, consider this part of an official medical checkup."
m_ex_mary_04_16,Please answer honestly.
m_ex_mary_04_17,"Actually, my whole body has been aching."
m_ex_mary_04_18,I knew it.
m_ex_mary_04_19,"Your body alignment is off,"
m_ex_mary_04_20,and it's causing your back to hunch more than usual.
m_ex_mary_04_21,"If we don't do something,"
m_ex_mary_04_22,"the imbalance will only increase,"
m_ex_mary_04_23,"and that will lead to more aggravated shoulder stiffness, lower back pain, and possibly sciatic issues."
m_ex_mary_04_24,"If left untreated for long enough, your internal organs could even be affected."
m_ex_mary_04_25,That bad?!
m_ex_mary_04_26,I'm just saying it's a possibility.
m_ex_mary_04_27,"Basically,"
m_ex_mary_04_28,what I'm getting at is that you should come in regularly for physical therapy.
m_ex_mary_04_29,Understood?
m_ex_mary_04_30,Okay.
m_ex_mary_04_31,"Hehe, good. Just remember that you promised to show up!"
m_ex_mary_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_05_2,"you've been up to a lot lately, haven't you?"
m_ex_mary_05_3,Are you feeling okay?
m_ex_mary_05_4,I'm a little hungover.
m_ex_mary_05_5,I'm as healthy as a horse.
m_ex_mary_05_6,"Oh dear, sounds like you had a little too much to drink."
m_ex_mary_05_7,You should know that excessive drinking is harmful to your health.
m_ex_mary_05_8,"However, what I'm asking doesn't necessarily pertain to hangovers."
m_ex_mary_05_9,Is that really true?
m_ex_mary_05_10,Then why do you look so unhealthy to me?
m_ex_mary_05_11,Be honest with me.
m_ex_mary_05_12,"You haven't been sleeping well lately, am I right?"
m_ex_mary_05_13,How did you know?
m_ex_mary_05_14,Hehe.
m_ex_mary_05_15,Rapi consulted me about it.
m_ex_mary_05_16,She's worried that you haven't been getting enough sleep lately.
m_ex_mary_05_17,Really?
m_ex_mary_05_18,"I understand that you've got a lot on your plate,"
m_ex_mary_05_19,but you're overworking yourself.
m_ex_mary_05_20,"If you keep leading this kind of lifestyle,"
m_ex_mary_05_21,it'll wreak havoc on your sleep schedule.
m_ex_mary_05_22,I'll try to be more mindful.
m_ex_mary_05_23,You really should.
m_ex_mary_05_24,"I know that your work weighs heavy on your mind,"
m_ex_mary_05_25,"and that old habits die hard,"
m_ex_mary_05_26,so I'll send you some special supplements for sleep.
m_ex_mary_05_27,Be sure to take them.
m_ex_mary_05_28,"Thank you, Mary."
m_ex_mary_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_mary_06_2,the supplements I sent should have arrived.
m_ex_mary_06_3,Did you get them?
m_ex_mary_06_4,"Yes, and I took some yesterday before I went to sleep."
m_ex_mary_06_5,That's great!
m_ex_mary_06_6,It's a supplement Pepper and I take regularly.
m_ex_mary_06_7,They work wonders when you're having trouble sleeping.
m_ex_mary_06_8,Did it work for you?
m_ex_mary_06_9,It worked too well. I ended up oversleeping.
m_ex_mary_06_10,"Hehe, I'm glad it was so effective."
m_ex_mary_06_11,They say good sleep is better than nearly any medication.
m_ex_mary_06_12,It seems like sending you those vitamins really was the right move.
m_ex_mary_06_13,Vitamins?
m_ex_mary_06_14,"Hehe, yes."
m_ex_mary_06_15,"Actually, those special ""supplements"" that I sent you"
m_ex_mary_06_16,are just ordinary over-the-shelf vitamins you can get in any store.
m_ex_mary_06_17,So that means...
m_ex_mary_06_18,"Yes, this was all a placebo effect."
m_ex_mary_06_19,"You see,"
m_ex_mary_06_20,even fake medications can have a salubrious effect.
m_ex_mary_06_21,"Of course, that's not to knock actual medication,"
m_ex_mary_06_22,"but in cases where sleep deprivation is starting to have a significant impact on your mental faculties,"
m_ex_mary_06_23,I've found this method to be the most effective in producing positive outcomes.
m_ex_mary_06_24,I see.
m_ex_mary_06_25,"Anyway,"
m_ex_mary_06_26,I'm glad to hear that you slept well.
m_ex_mary_06_27,"If you ever find yourself in need of any similar supplements,"
m_ex_mary_06_28,"just say the word, hehe."
m_ex_maxwell_04_1,"Cutey,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_2,I have a favor to ask.
m_ex_maxwell_04_3,"If this is another one of your experiments, I refuse."
m_ex_maxwell_04_4,I'm not available right now.
m_ex_maxwell_04_5,Haha!
m_ex_maxwell_04_6,Do you think experiments are all I ever talk about?
m_ex_maxwell_04_7,"If that's true, then why are you responding to my message?"
m_ex_maxwell_04_8,There's something I want to discuss with you.
m_ex_maxwell_04_9,What is it?
m_ex_maxwell_04_10,Come with me up to the surface.
m_ex_maxwell_04_11,??
m_ex_maxwell_04_12,"Ha, you're so adorable when you're confused."
m_ex_maxwell_04_13,How much do you know about camping?
m_ex_maxwell_04_14,Depends on what you mean by camping.
m_ex_maxwell_04_15,Fine.
m_ex_maxwell_04_16,"I'm not talking about the kind of camping you do while out on a mission,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_17,but the kind that you do for fun.
m_ex_maxwell_04_18,"You mean setting up a tent, cooking some food over the campfire, stuff like that?"
m_ex_maxwell_04_19,Exactly!
m_ex_maxwell_04_20,There's a TV program on it that I'm watching right now.
m_ex_maxwell_04_21,Taking a tent and going out into the remote wilderness
m_ex_maxwell_04_22,"may be uncomfortable at times,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_23,but it's also terribly romantic.
m_ex_maxwell_04_24,"Our hope is that when humanity reclaims the surface,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_25,there will come a day
m_ex_maxwell_04_26,"when we all can stare at the starry night sky,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_27,and feel that sense of freedom wash over us once again.
m_ex_maxwell_04_28,Isn't that fantastic?!
m_ex_maxwell_04_29,Very much so.
m_ex_maxwell_04_30,"So, if for nothing else than for research purposes,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_31,would you like to take some camping equipment up to the surface?
m_ex_maxwell_04_32,That would be extremely dangerous.
m_ex_maxwell_04_33,"Well,"
m_ex_maxwell_04_34,I guess that's true.
m_ex_maxwell_04_35,We probably shouldn't then...
m_ex_maxwell_04_36,We'll go when we reclaim the surface.
m_ex_maxwell_04_37,"Hehe, okay!"
m_ex_maxwell_04_38,Promise?
m_ex_maxwell_04_39,"This is great, because now I have something concrete to work towards."
m_ex_maxwell_04_40,I'm gonna buy this and that all in preparation for this momentous occasion!
m_ex_maxwell_05_1,Hmm...
m_ex_maxwell_05_2,"Cutey,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_3,do you remember the lemonade
m_ex_maxwell_05_4,you bought me during our last experiment?
m_ex_maxwell_05_5,"Yes, I remember."
m_ex_maxwell_05_6,It was so delicious
m_ex_maxwell_05_7,that I've decided to
m_ex_maxwell_05_8,only buy lemonade from that café.
m_ex_maxwell_05_9,"Even so, it hasn't been quite the same as when I had it with you."
m_ex_maxwell_05_10,"So I thought I'd try my hand at making my own,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_11,"but even then, it still doesn't measure up."
m_ex_maxwell_05_12,Nothing beats homemade lemonade.
m_ex_maxwell_05_13,"You're right about that,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_14,but it's more involved than you may have been led to believe.
m_ex_maxwell_05_15,"The recipe itself is simple,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_16,"but even after I tinkered with the ratios and put in all sorts of different ingredients,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_17,it still doesn't hold a candle to that lemonade you bought me.
m_ex_maxwell_05_18,How much different can one lemonade taste from the other?
m_ex_maxwell_05_19,"I'm disappointed in you, Cutey."
m_ex_maxwell_05_20,I can't believe you don't appreciate
m_ex_maxwell_05_21,the subtle difference in taste between certain beverages.
m_ex_maxwell_05_22,"Although, come to think of it,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_23,the fault may not lie in the recipe.
m_ex_maxwell_05_24,Then what is it?
m_ex_maxwell_05_25,"You bought me that lemonade before,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_26,"and I drank it when I was beside you,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_27,so I think that may be what made it taste especially wonderful to me.
m_ex_maxwell_05_28,I think you might be onto something.
m_ex_maxwell_05_29,"In that case,"
m_ex_maxwell_05_30,let's go get some lemonade!
m_ex_maxwell_05_31,Hurry on over! I'll be waiting.
m_ex_maxwell_05_32,Oh... okay.
m_ex_maxwell_06_1,Ugh...
m_ex_maxwell_06_2,"Cutey, help."
m_ex_maxwell_06_3,Is it Laplace again?
m_ex_maxwell_06_4,Is it Drake again?
m_ex_maxwell_06_5,Correct.
m_ex_maxwell_06_6,She did it again.
m_ex_maxwell_06_7,"Surprisingly, no."
m_ex_maxwell_06_8,It's the other one this time around.
m_ex_maxwell_06_9,"Honestly, they're both equally frustrating,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_10,but Laplace is constantly breaking windows left and right.
m_ex_maxwell_06_11,"I've begged her countless times to stop, but it's never done any good."
m_ex_maxwell_06_12,I've had to change my window in the Commander's Room several times already.
m_ex_maxwell_06_13,I can only imagine.
m_ex_maxwell_06_14,"Normally, I can let her escapades slide,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_15,"but this time,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_16,Syuen was on the receiving end of her antics.
m_ex_maxwell_06_17,How did that come about?
m_ex_maxwell_06_18,"We went to Syuen's office, as we always do, to report in,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_19,"and Laplace, being herself,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_20,"barged in through the window, going on about a heroic entrance and all that non-sense."
m_ex_maxwell_06_21,Sounds like quite the scene.
m_ex_maxwell_06_22,It was.
m_ex_maxwell_06_23,But what irks me the most is that
m_ex_maxwell_06_24,I'm the one who caught the most heat for it from Syuen.
m_ex_maxwell_06_25,"She knew right off the bat that Laplace was incorrigible, so instead,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_26,she asked me to make a shatter-proof window.
m_ex_maxwell_06_27,Were you able to pull it off?
m_ex_maxwell_06_28,I was.
m_ex_maxwell_06_29,"After swapping out the standard windows in Syuen's office for ones that were shatter-proof,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_30,"I thought that would be the end of it, but..."
m_ex_maxwell_06_31,But what?
m_ex_maxwell_06_32,"Laplace ended up getting angry at the window,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_33,"since it refused to break,"
m_ex_maxwell_06_34,and kept fighting with it.
m_ex_maxwell_06_35,Yikes.
m_ex_maxwell_06_36,Oh no...
m_ex_maxwell_06_37,I'm getting a call from Syuen.
m_ex_maxwell_06_38,Sounds like you're really going through it.
m_ex_maxwell_06_39,You can say that again. I'll be back.
m_ex_noir_04_1,"Pit Boss,"
m_ex_noir_04_2,do you have a free moment?
m_ex_noir_04_3,"Sure, what is it?"
m_ex_noir_04_4,How should I phrase this...
m_ex_noir_04_5,"I was hoping I could get your opinion on something,"
m_ex_noir_04_6,er...
m_ex_noir_04_7,but...
m_ex_noir_04_8,"if you're busy,"
m_ex_noir_04_9,then we can talk about it later.
m_ex_noir_04_10,I'm not busy at all.
m_ex_noir_04_11,"Okay, we'll have to take a rain check on this."
m_ex_noir_04_12,That's good.
m_ex_noir_04_13,"Okay,"
m_ex_noir_04_14,I'll get in touch another time.
m_ex_noir_04_15,Just kidding.
m_ex_noir_04_16,Huh?
m_ex_noir_04_17,"Oh, so that was a joke? Ha, I'm glad."
m_ex_noir_04_18,Anyway...
m_ex_noir_04_19,A package got sent to Coin Rush
m_ex_noir_04_20,which was addressed to Blanc and me.
m_ex_noir_04_21,"When we opened it,"
m_ex_noir_04_22,there was what looked like some kind of energy drink inside.
m_ex_noir_04_23,"A gift from a fan, perhaps?"
m_ex_noir_04_24,"That's what we thought,"
m_ex_noir_04_25,but something seems off.
m_ex_noir_04_26,It's a drink I've never seen before.
m_ex_noir_04_27,I'm not sure if I should drink it or not.
m_ex_noir_04_28,What's written on the bottle?
m_ex_noir_04_29,"Just a second, let me see."
m_ex_noir_04_30,Endurance Boost.
m_ex_noir_04_31,Stand tall and rise to full mast.
m_ex_noir_04_32,Make your girlfriend go crazy for you.
m_ex_noir_04_33,That's what it says.
m_ex_noir_04_34,Do you have any idea what it could be?
m_ex_noir_04_35,Er... I think that drink is meant for men only.
m_ex_noir_04_36,Really?
m_ex_noir_04_37,I had no idea
m_ex_noir_04_38,energy drinks could be gender specific.
m_ex_noir_04_39,What should I do with it then?
m_ex_noir_04_40,"Oh wait,"
m_ex_noir_04_41,I know!
m_ex_noir_04_42,You can have it.
m_ex_noir_04_43,...
m_ex_noir_04_44,I'll give it to you after our next show.
m_ex_noir_04_45,Um... thanks.
m_ex_noir_04_46,You're welcome!
m_ex_noir_05_1,"Pit Boss,"
m_ex_noir_05_2,I've got something on my mind.
m_ex_noir_05_3,Could you lend me your ear?
m_ex_noir_05_4,"Sure, what is it?"
m_ex_noir_05_5,We're planning
m_ex_noir_05_6,"a new performance at Coin Rush,"
m_ex_noir_05_7,but it's been rather difficult.
m_ex_noir_05_8,"No matter how much I practice,"
m_ex_noir_05_9,I can't seem to get my form right.
m_ex_noir_05_10,I don't know what else I can possibly do.
m_ex_noir_05_11,So this was what Blanc was worried about.
m_ex_noir_05_12,Huh?
m_ex_noir_05_13,What are you talking about?
m_ex_noir_05_14,Blanc was telling me how she was worried you were too fixated on practicing.
m_ex_noir_05_15,She did?
m_ex_noir_05_16,So she was concerned about me?
m_ex_noir_05_17,That's so sweet of her.
m_ex_noir_05_18,So you should heed her advice and rest for a while.
m_ex_noir_05_19,"Oh no,"
m_ex_noir_05_20,I can't do that.
m_ex_noir_05_21,I have an integral part in this upcoming performance.
m_ex_noir_05_22,"If I don't practice, the entire show could go up in flames."
m_ex_noir_05_23,"It was your form that was giving you trouble, wasn't it?"
m_ex_noir_05_24,Yes.
m_ex_noir_05_25,It might be because you're actually practicing too much.
m_ex_noir_05_26,What?
m_ex_noir_05_27,Hmm...
m_ex_noir_05_28,Are you trying to say that resting can be just as important as practicing?
m_ex_noir_05_29,That's right.
m_ex_noir_05_30,Oooooh...
m_ex_noir_05_31,Okay.
m_ex_noir_05_32,"Well, since you and Blanc both seem to feel the same about this,"
m_ex_noir_05_33,I guess I'll take a break.
m_ex_noir_05_34,Don't push yourself too hard.
m_ex_noir_05_35,Okay!
m_ex_noir_05_36,"Thanks, Pit Boss, hehe."
m_ex_noir_06_1,Pit Boss!
m_ex_noir_06_2,"After our performance, I went to the green room,"
m_ex_noir_06_3,and there were all these snacks laid out on the table.
m_ex_noir_06_4,I was told they were from you.
m_ex_noir_06_5,Is that true?
m_ex_noir_06_6,Yes.
m_ex_noir_06_7,Oh my goodness!
m_ex_noir_06_8,Thank you.
m_ex_noir_06_9,"Blanc and I were so surprised,"
m_ex_noir_06_10,you should have seen our faces.
m_ex_noir_06_11,A small token of my gratitude for you both putting on such a marvelous performance.
m_ex_noir_06_12,"Aw, Pit Boss,"
m_ex_noir_06_13,you're gonna make us cry by saying stuff like that.
m_ex_noir_06_14,"Where did you get all this, anyway?"
m_ex_noir_06_15,"It's all from famous stores where you have to line up outside to get in,"
m_ex_noir_06_16,and there's so much of it!
m_ex_noir_06_17,It was nothing.
m_ex_noir_06_18,I asked Neon and Anis to stand in line.
m_ex_noir_06_19,Oh my gosh...
m_ex_noir_06_20,I think I might have to redo my makeup.
m_ex_noir_06_21,"You're making me all emotional, and I've still got another performance coming up!"
m_ex_noir_06_22,Lol!
m_ex_noir_06_23,"Oh my goodness! Well, I feel bad for them having to wait for so long, but thank you all the same, Pit Boss."
m_ex_noir_06_24,You both put on a spectacular performance.
m_ex_noir_06_25,"Thank you, Pit Boss."
m_ex_noir_06_26,Blanc and I will both keep working hard so that we can keep putting on great shows.
m_ex_noir_06_27,"As for these snacks, I'm going to enjoy them greatly."
m_ex_noir_06_28,"Please do, and break a leg out there."
m_ex_noir_06_29,Thanks!
m_ex_pepper_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_pepper_04_2,are you a big fan of TV?
m_ex_pepper_04_3,"I'm obsessed with several shows, so much so that I record them so that I don't miss a single episode."
m_ex_pepper_04_4,I'm not particularly interested in stories that are made up.
m_ex_pepper_04_5,"Wow,"
m_ex_pepper_04_6,"even with as busy as you are, you still find time to watch some shows?"
m_ex_pepper_04_7,That's incredible.
m_ex_pepper_04_8,You think so?
m_ex_pepper_04_9,Fictional stories can be fun sometimes.
m_ex_pepper_04_10,Ah!
m_ex_pepper_04_11,"The reason I asked is because there's this show everyone's been talking about,"
m_ex_pepper_04_12,Super Doctor.
m_ex_pepper_04_13,Have you heard of it?
m_ex_pepper_04_14,I think I have.
m_ex_pepper_04_15,"The main characters are all doctors,"
m_ex_pepper_04_16,just like Mary and I.
m_ex_pepper_04_17,It's about
m_ex_pepper_04_18,how they use miracle surgeries
m_ex_pepper_04_19,to treat patients with serious injuries and incurable diseases.
m_ex_pepper_04_20,Sounds like a lot of fun.
m_ex_pepper_04_21,It is!
m_ex_pepper_04_22,"The doctors on the show only treat humans,"
m_ex_pepper_04_23,"so it's a little different from Mary and me,"
m_ex_pepper_04_24,but I'm always invested in every single episode that I watch.
m_ex_pepper_04_25,If I keep working hard
m_ex_pepper_04_26,"and expand my knowledge and skillset,"
m_ex_pepper_04_27,do you think I could become like a super doctor who can cure anything?
m_ex_pepper_04_28,I'm positive that you can do it.
m_ex_pepper_04_29,That's wonderful to hear you say that.
m_ex_pepper_04_30,I'll keep studying hard
m_ex_pepper_04_31,"so that everyone around me can lead longer, happier,"
m_ex_pepper_04_32,and healthier lives!
m_ex_pepper_04_33,"I can't wait for that day to arrive, Super Doctor Pepper."
m_ex_pepper_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_pepper_05_2,"I realize this is a rather abrupt question,"
m_ex_pepper_05_3,but do you believe in ghosts?
m_ex_pepper_05_4,I've seen a ghost in the hospital on several occasions.
m_ex_pepper_05_5,Pepper! Behind you!
m_ex_pepper_05_6,Gah!
m_ex_pepper_05_7,Don't do that!
m_ex_pepper_05_8,That's not funny.
m_ex_pepper_05_9,"Hehe, sorry. Anyway, why are you asking?"
m_ex_pepper_05_10,"Unfortunately,"
m_ex_pepper_05_11,"death is something inexorably linked with hospitals,"
m_ex_pepper_05_12,and so it's only natural that they're a hotbed for ghost stories.
m_ex_pepper_05_13,"As an adult, you can just laugh it off,"
m_ex_pepper_05_14,but kids have a tendency to actually believe in that kind of thing.
m_ex_pepper_05_15,"They might have trouble sleeping,"
m_ex_pepper_05_16,or be scared of going to the restroom at night.
m_ex_pepper_05_17,"A lot of scary ghost stories have been circulating recently, and it's got me worried."
m_ex_pepper_05_18,What kind of stories?
m_ex_pepper_05_19,The worst is about a girl who carries around a needle.
m_ex_pepper_05_20,"You can often hear her voice in the dead of night,"
m_ex_pepper_05_21,"and if you follow that voice, you're led to a locked research lab"
m_ex_pepper_05_22,"that hasn't been used in ages,"
m_ex_pepper_05_23,yet somehow has light seeping out from under the door.
m_ex_pepper_05_24,Wait a minute...
m_ex_pepper_05_25,"Even though everyone knows not to go in that room,"
m_ex_pepper_05_26,"in they go, as if they've been possessed by an external force."
m_ex_pepper_05_27,"Inside,"
m_ex_pepper_05_28,there's a girl with braided hair
m_ex_pepper_05_29,"standing with her back turned,"
m_ex_pepper_05_30,who slowly turns her head and says:
m_ex_pepper_05_31,"Oh, another child who's been naughty?"
m_ex_pepper_05_32,"Then she slowly starts to approach you,"
m_ex_pepper_05_33,while staring directly into your soul the entire time.
m_ex_pepper_05_34,Pepper...
m_ex_pepper_05_35,"I know, it's terrifying."
m_ex_pepper_05_36,That must be what's got the children so spooked.
m_ex_pepper_05_37,"No, it's not that."
m_ex_pepper_05_38,Huh?
m_ex_pepper_05_39,What do you mean?
m_ex_pepper_05_40,I think you're talking about Mary.
m_ex_pepper_05_41,...
m_ex_pepper_05_42,Er...
m_ex_pepper_05_43,I'll check back in with you once I've talked to Mary.
m_ex_pepper_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_pepper_06_2,I wanted to consult with you about something.
m_ex_pepper_06_3,Are you free?
m_ex_pepper_06_4,"Sure, what's up?"
m_ex_pepper_06_5,I've been thinking for a while
m_ex_pepper_06_6,about adding some decorations to the rooms
m_ex_pepper_06_7,where long-term patients are staying.
m_ex_pepper_06_8,"That way, we could make them feel more at home during their stay."
m_ex_pepper_06_9,That's a great idea.
m_ex_pepper_06_10,You think so?
m_ex_pepper_06_11,"The only thing is that I don't really have a lot of money to spare,"
m_ex_pepper_06_12,so what are some affordable things you think I could buy?
m_ex_pepper_06_13,How about hanging some paintings?
m_ex_pepper_06_14,Paintings?
m_ex_pepper_06_15,Hmm...
m_ex_pepper_06_16,Wouldn't it get expensive to hang one in every room?
m_ex_pepper_06_17,You can hang the pictures made by the young patients.
m_ex_pepper_06_18,!!
m_ex_pepper_06_19,Ooh!
m_ex_pepper_06_20,That's a really good idea.
m_ex_pepper_06_21,"The young patients can have fun drawing,"
m_ex_pepper_06_22,and the long-term patients
m_ex_pepper_06_23,can benefit from having a bit more color in their rooms.
m_ex_pepper_06_24,"You're the best, Commander!"
m_ex_pepper_06_25,I better go prepare the art supplies.
m_ex_pepper_06_26,Good luck.
m_ex_pepper_06_27,"Thanks,"
m_ex_pepper_06_28,Commander!
m_ex_privaty_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_privaty_04_2,have you heard about
m_ex_privaty_04_3,the small festival
m_ex_privaty_04_4,they're holding
m_ex_privaty_04_5,on Royal Road?
m_ex_privaty_04_6,"No, this is the first time I've heard of it."
m_ex_privaty_04_7,I figured as much.
m_ex_privaty_04_8,"You're off in the boondocks,"
m_ex_privaty_04_9,so it's no surprise word reaches you last.
m_ex_privaty_04_10,"Here in the Ark, it's creating quite the stir."
m_ex_privaty_04_11,So did you message me just to rub it in my face?
m_ex_privaty_04_12,Of course not.
m_ex_privaty_04_13,"I thought I might have to handle administrative tasks for this event,"
m_ex_privaty_04_14,"but I don't have much experience with this kind of festival,"
m_ex_privaty_04_15,so I wanted to see
m_ex_privaty_04_16,if you knew anything about this event.
m_ex_privaty_04_17,"Actually, I was lying earlier. I have heard about this festival before."
m_ex_privaty_04_18,What?
m_ex_privaty_04_19,Really?
m_ex_privaty_04_20,How much do you know?
m_ex_privaty_04_21,Tell me everything.
m_ex_privaty_04_22,"Well, for one thing, it's happening in the evening."
m_ex_privaty_04_23,Okay.
m_ex_privaty_04_24,I heard there will be fireworks.
m_ex_privaty_04_25,"Oooh,"
m_ex_privaty_04_26,that'll be great!
m_ex_privaty_04_27,For sure.
m_ex_privaty_04_28,"So,"
m_ex_privaty_04_29,um...
m_ex_privaty_04_30,"do you have to work that day, by any chance?"
m_ex_privaty_04_31,"I mean,"
m_ex_privaty_04_32,"considering that there will be fireworks at an official Ark-based event,"
m_ex_privaty_04_33,you and I could go out for a joint inspection.
m_ex_privaty_04_34,Are you asking me on a date to go see the fireworks?
m_ex_privaty_04_35,"Ugh, in your dreams!"
m_ex_privaty_04_36,How could you be so crude?
m_ex_privaty_04_37,"I'm just asking if you want to tag along with me, that's all!"
m_ex_privaty_04_38,Hahaha. Okay.
m_ex_privaty_04_39,"Anyway,"
m_ex_privaty_04_40,make sure to save the date.
m_ex_privaty_04_41,I'm gonna head out.
m_ex_privaty_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_privaty_05_2,today is the day of the fireworks.
m_ex_privaty_05_3,They'll be setting them off at 10 pm tonight.
m_ex_privaty_05_4,I know.
m_ex_privaty_05_5,So...
m_ex_privaty_05_6,Um...
m_ex_privaty_05_7,What's your schedule like tonight?
m_ex_privaty_05_8,"Just catching up on some work, I suppose."
m_ex_privaty_05_9,I was going to hang out with Rapi.
m_ex_privaty_05_10,"Oh, right."
m_ex_privaty_05_11,Yeah.
m_ex_privaty_05_12,I figured you'd be busy today.
m_ex_privaty_05_13,Excuse me?!
m_ex_privaty_05_14,I know for a fact that
m_ex_privaty_05_15,I told you to remember this date.
m_ex_privaty_05_16,I'm just kidding. But I do have to work today.
m_ex_privaty_05_17,Oh.
m_ex_privaty_05_18,I see.
m_ex_privaty_05_19,Well...
m_ex_privaty_05_20,"if you happen to find yourself in the Ark,"
m_ex_privaty_05_21,"I figured there might be a big crowd around,"
m_ex_privaty_05_22,so I could act as your security.
m_ex_privaty_05_23,"I'd like very much to watch the fireworks with you, Privaty."
m_ex_privaty_05_24,What?
m_ex_privaty_05_25,I'm just talking about my role as a security advisor!
m_ex_privaty_05_26,The idea of watching fireworks with you
m_ex_privaty_05_27,never crossed my mind!
m_ex_privaty_05_28,Not even once?
m_ex_privaty_05_29,No.
m_ex_privaty_05_30,I mean...
m_ex_privaty_05_31,"I figured I could be security and also watch fireworks at the same time,"
m_ex_privaty_05_32,but oh well.
m_ex_privaty_05_33,I'll just watch them alone.
m_ex_privaty_05_34,We can go together next time.
m_ex_privaty_05_35,It's fine.
m_ex_privaty_05_36,"I do feel kind of bad for you though,"
m_ex_privaty_05_37,"having to work so late,"
m_ex_privaty_05_38,so I'll try to stop by
m_ex_privaty_05_39,and show you some photos of the fireworks.
m_ex_privaty_05_40,Not that I mean anything by it!
m_ex_privaty_05_41,Don't go getting any funny ideas.
m_ex_privaty_05_42,"Okay, okay."
m_ex_privaty_05_43,"Well then,"
m_ex_privaty_05_44,I'll see you later.
m_ex_privaty_06_1,Commandr.
m_ex_privaty_06_2,Commander.
m_ex_privaty_06_3,I have a favor to ask!
m_ex_privaty_06_4,I need you to help me
m_ex_privaty_06_5,purchase something online
m_ex_privaty_06_6,at the top of the hour.
m_ex_privaty_06_7,Why don't you buy it yourself?
m_ex_privaty_06_8,I can't do it on my own.
m_ex_privaty_06_9,This thing is going to sell out in no time.
m_ex_privaty_06_10,"Even if you've got a group of people trying to get some, you still might end up empty-handed."
m_ex_privaty_06_11,"Please, I'm asking for your help."
m_ex_privaty_06_12,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_privaty_06_13,It's a website for beauty products.
m_ex_privaty_06_14,You've got to register as a member
m_ex_privaty_06_15,and purchase the magic cream
m_ex_privaty_06_16,that's on the main page
m_ex_privaty_06_17,before time runs out.
m_ex_privaty_06_18,"Okay, I'll do my best"
m_ex_privaty_06_19,Soon after...
m_ex_privaty_06_20,Dang it!
m_ex_privaty_06_21,I failed.
m_ex_privaty_06_22,It feels like everyone in the Ark is trying to buy this stuff.
m_ex_privaty_06_23,"I pressed it the first second I could, and I still wasn't fast enough."
m_ex_privaty_06_24,How could they run out of stock instantaneously?
m_ex_privaty_06_25,I was able to purchase some.
m_ex_privaty_06_26,"Wait,"
m_ex_privaty_06_27,are you serious?!
m_ex_privaty_06_28,How?
m_ex_privaty_06_29,How did you do it?
m_ex_privaty_06_30,"I said I would help, and so I did."
m_ex_privaty_06_31,"I was quick on the draw, apparently."
m_ex_privaty_06_32,I can't believe it. I was starting to lose hope.
m_ex_privaty_06_33,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_privaty_06_34,I need you.
m_ex_privaty_06_35,"Er, for helping me buy that magic cream,"
m_ex_privaty_06_36,I mean.
m_ex_privaty_06_37,"I didn't mean it like that,"
m_ex_privaty_06_38,I swear.
m_ex_privaty_06_39,"Haha, okay. I'll let you know when it gets delivered to me."
m_ex_privaty_06_40,Okay! Thanks again.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_1,Poli has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_2,Poli has invited Anis to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_3,Poli has invited Neon to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_4,Poli has invited Rapi to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_5,"Hello, everyone."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_6,"In case we run into anything unexpected,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_7,I've created this group chat which includes our temporary additions
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_8,who are backing up the A.C.P.U.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_9,What in the world is going on with the group name?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_10,Who came up with that?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_11,I did!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_12,We are the hardworking public servants
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_13,"gallantly safeguarding the public,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_14,so this hereby shall be called: The Citizens!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_15,Wow.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_16,Interesting.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_17,How exciting!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_18,This is my first time attending such a big Halloween bash.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_19,Me too!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_20,It's a bit of a shame we can't dress up...
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_21,"Actually, it's a really big shame, but nevertheless,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_22,at least we've got our foot in the door now.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_23,"Next Halloween, we can dress up to the nines."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_24,Sounds good!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_25,It'd be a lot of fun to get dressed up next time.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_26,...
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_27,"Have you thought about what kind of costume you'd want to wear, Anis?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_28,Me?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_29,Hmm...
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_30,"To be honest, I never gave it too much thought."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_31,"A sexy witch, maybe?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_32,Booooring.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_33,Pretty pedestrian.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_34,Soooo played out.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_35,Why are you guys ganging up on me?!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_36,"Commander,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_37,what do you think about a sexy witch?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_38,Do you feel the same way?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_39,Honestly? Not a fan.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_40,!!
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_41,... Screw you guys.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_42,What's that supposed to mean?
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_43,"Oh, wait! I take it that you're excited for it."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_44,"You're the only one who always has my back, Commander."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_45,"You say this group chat was created as a precaution,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_46,yet it seems it's only being used for idle chatter.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_47,"Whatever do you mean, Rapi?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_48,"Yeah, what do you mean?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_49,It's just a bit of innocent banter.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_50,"Yeah, totally!"
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_51,...
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_52,"Regardless, we're better off now that this group chat exists."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_53,"If anyone sees anything suspicious, be sure to report it in here."
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_54,See you at the event.
m_ex_freezeacpu_01_55,Okay.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_1,How is everyone?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_2,Everything good on your end?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_3,Nothing much going on here for Poli and me.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_4,"The food here smells amazing,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_5,but Poli isn't letting me have any.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_6,They're intending to sell these later.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_7,You've got to at least wait until the stalls open.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_8,Ugh. Fiiine.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_9,I had a duel with Miranda.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_10,...
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_11,But I lost.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_12,"Just imagine! I, who walk the path of firepower,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_13,lost to Miranda in a shooting game.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_14,Ha!
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_15,"A shooting game, you say?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_16,"Yeah,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_17,you've got to hit different-sized pumpkins with a toy gun.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_18,"Since I'm a cop,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_19,I know how to handle a firearm.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_20,I think that may be why I won.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_21,So you think I don't know how to handle a firearm?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_22,How is that even possible?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_23,Firepower is my life!
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_24,Could it have to do with the weight?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_25,A toy gun is much lighter than a real weapon.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_26,"No, no, no."
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_27,A gun is a gun.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_28,Firepower is firepower.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_29,The gun's weight doesn't matter. There's no way I should be losing.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_30,How bad did you lose?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_31,"You didn't get pummeled, did you?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_32,No.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_33,"We both missed one of the pumpkins, so we tied at 90 points each."
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_34,Huh?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_35,Then how come Neon is saying that she lost?
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_36,"Because as soon as I missed a target,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_37,I had already lost.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_38,Uh-huh.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_39,I see.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_40,Quiry and Commander aren't reading any of these messages.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_41,They must be occupied.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_42,"Hmm, you're right."
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_43,Hopefully it's nothing...
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_44,What could possibly have happened? The event hasn't even started yet.
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_45,Hmm...
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_46,Exactly...
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_47,"Anyway, good luck, everyone."
m_ex_freezeacpu_02_48,Same to you!
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_1,"Everything good on your end, everyone?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_2,"All good here,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_3,but I think Drake is still out there harassing everyone.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_4,Isn't the event over?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_5,I didn't tell her.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_6,Me neither.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_7,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_8,Hmm...
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_9,I say we don't tell her.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_10,She seems to be enjoying herself.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_11,"Yeah,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_12,no reason to spoil the fun for her.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_13,"Other than that, is there anything else?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_14,Nope.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_15,"You still seem kind of wound up,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_16,Quiry.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_17,Relax a little.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_18,?!
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_19,You can tell that just through my text messages?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_20,The fact you keep asking how everyone is doing is a clear indicator.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_21,Oh...
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_22,Sorry if I'm stressing anyone out.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_23,"It's okay, really."
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_24,"Anyway,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_25,"since we're all here chatting,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_26,has anyone seen anything fun or interesting?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_27,Anything fun?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_28,Hmm...
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_29,"The people over here are dressed up as ghouls, and they look so real."
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_30,They're scaring all the younger children away.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_31,Lol
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_32,Hilarious.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_33,"Other than that though,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_34,there's not much happening at the Horror Zone.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_35,I haven't seen anyone else recently except for the Commander.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_36,Sounds like you two are having fun.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_37,What do you mean by that?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_38,"I'm just messin' with ya, hehe."
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_39,"Anyway, we gorged on all these sweets,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_40,and I'm pretty sure I've given myself a few new cavities.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_41,Totally.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_42,I need something to drink...
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_43,Sounds to me like we're having the most fun
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_44,over here at the Game Zone.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_45,We're having a blast playing all sorts of different games.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_46,"So you're just horsing around, playing games?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_47,Yep!
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_48,Er... I mean no.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_49,Rapi and Miranda are the ones playing around.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_50,Did someone say my name?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_51,Rapi?
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_52,"Anyway, I'm busy."
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_53,Later!
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_54,...
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_55,"I'm glad that you're not nervous,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_56,but you should try and take this a bit more seriously.
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_57,"Okay, we will."
m_ex_freezeacpu_03_58,Stay in touch.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_1,It was so late in the evening that
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_2,"we never had the chance to have proper goodbyes,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_3,"but great job, everyone."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_4,Thanks for helping out!
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_5,You all did fantastic.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_6,You guys worked just as hard.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_7,It was fun!
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_8,Glad we were of good assistance.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_9,I'm just glad nothing serious happened.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_10,Likewise.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_11,"Sure, there was a minor incident,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_12,but it was all resolved peacefully.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_13,These people have remarkable stamina.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_14,I don't know how they're able to stay up all night like this.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_15,"That's the power of youth, my friend."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_16,"Hey, it's not like we're old fogies just yet!"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_17,I'm just saying.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_18,"Anyway,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_19,I wanted to let the Counters and the Commander know
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_20,just how much we appreciate you helping us out.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_21,"If you need us for anything in the future,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_22,you can call on us anytime.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_23,Noted.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_24,"I know this was technically a job,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_25,"but I had a lot of fun, and I'm sure everyone else did too."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_26,For sure.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_27,"Next time, we should ditch the work aspect"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_28,and just have all of us hang out and have fun.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_29,That's a great idea!
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_30,Agreed.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_31,"Anyway,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_32,"we all pretty much pulled an all-nighter,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_33,"so get some well-deserved rest, everyone."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_34,"Also, Halloween isn't over just yet,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_35,so you've still got time to enjoy a few other events if you're up for it.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_36,I think I'll do just that!
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_37,"... After a few hours of shuteye, of course."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_38,Me too.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_39,"Okay, sleep well."
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_40,"We're going to get some sleep too, aren't we, Poli?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_41,Yes.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_42,We should do our utmost not to deviate from our usual sleep schedule.
m_ex_freezeacpu_04_43,Mhmm!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_1,Wow!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_2,"Everyone, make sure you visit the Day and Night pub in the Ark."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_3,It's out of this world.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_4,Did you go there for a drink?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_5,"No, I haven't had a drop."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_6,"I came out to buy a few things,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_7,when suddenly these ladies dressed up in freaky costumes popped out.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_8,"They kept trying to convince me to go into the store,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_9,"so even though I had some reservations,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_10,I decided to head in
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_11,and get into the Halloween spirit.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_12,"And let me tell you, it was fantastic!"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_13,How so?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_14,Was it the costumes that were amazing?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_15,Was it that the drinks tasted amazing?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_16,That's right!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_17,"See, you're the only one who gets me. Not these other chumps."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_18,"First them, now you, Commander?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_19,"I told you, I'm the furthest thing from a heavy drinker you can imagine."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_20,Everyone in the bar is all dressed up:
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_21,"the servers, the cooks, everyone."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_22,And they've gone all out with the costumes too.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_23,You should see how detailed they are.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_24,And don't get me started on their bodies.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_25,I knew it.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_26,You're just salivating over their bodies.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_27,You make it sound so crude.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_28,Isn't this a major draw for Halloween?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_29,You get to reveal a side of yourself
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_30,that you don't usually have the opportunity to flaunt.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_31,Halloween costumes are the perfect avenue for that.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_32,Ah-hah!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_33,Is that why you were going on about
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_34,wanting to be a sexy witch before?
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_35,!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_36,!!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_37,!!!
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_38,Sometimes it feels like
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_39,you all are out to get me...
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_40,"Anyway, if any of you are interested, you better hurry."
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_41,This place will just be a regular pub after Halloween.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_42,"I'm not sure if I can go,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_43,but thanks for the info.
m_ex_freezeacpu_05_44,No problem!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_1,Anis has invited Drake to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_2,Anis has invited Novel to join the group.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_3,Hmm?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_4,What's this all about?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_5,"These two had something to say,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_6,and asked to be invited to the chat.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_7,So I invited them.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_8,"Hello,jklasjfkl..."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_9,"I do,indeed,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_10,"have something to,say."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_11,What is it?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_12,"My poor,deduction skills,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_13,"caused,no small amount of,consternation for,everyone previously,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_14,"and for that,I apologize."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_15,"It was certainly,not intentional,on my part."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_16,"I will continue,to work on hard,on becoming,a better detective."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_17,I'm sure you'll get better with time.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_18,You already apologized to us once before.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_19,This is all a bit unnecessary.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_20,"Nevertheless, we appreciate the gesture."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_21,"It's,the least,I can do."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_22,"Having said that,if you have,any new cases,I'd love,to be a part of it..."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_23,Hey!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_24,How long am I gonna have to wait?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_25,A villain like me has better things to do with my time.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_26,"Oh,,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_27,"Sorry,Drake,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_28,go ahead.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_29,Why didn't any of you
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_30,tell me that the event had ended?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_31,I was out there stealing candy from kids all night!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_32,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_33,I guess we didn't tell you.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_34,"It's just that you were so into it,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_35,and you looked so happy.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_36,We didn't tell you because we didn't want to spoil the fun.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_37,...
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_38,"Well, to be honest, it was pretty enjoyable."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_39,But the next day was a huge wash! I wasn't able to get up to any villainous activities.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_40,I demand satisfaction!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_41,Hmm...
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_42,"I guess we don't have a choice, do we?"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_43,We'll have to lock you up in the prison cell for an hour.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_44,Oh!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_45,Really?
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_46,Mwahahaha!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_47,I'm on my way.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_48,Halloween is the best!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_49,Lol
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_50,"It sure is,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_51,and it's all thanks to you guys.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_52,I had a fun time as well.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_53,It truly was a Halloween for the ages.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_54,"In fact, once the holiday is over,"
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_55,we should leave this chat room here as a memory.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_56,Nice!
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_57,Good idea.
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_58,"All right, that settles it then."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_59,"I'll see you soon, Drake."
m_ex_freezeacpu_06_60,See ya!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_1,Tove has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_2,Tove has invited Ludmilla to join the group.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_3,Tove has invited Alice to join the group.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_4,Tove has invited Neve to join the group.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_5,"Okay,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_6,that's everyone!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_7,??
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_8,What's this group for?
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_9,I'd like to welcome you all
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_10,to the Snow Mountain Rescue Team group!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_11,Come again?
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_12,Yes!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_13,"When we're out on a search and rescue mission,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_14,I think it'll be best to communicate using Blabla.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_15,Hmm...
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_16,Why not just use the Unlimited group chat?
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_17,Hmm...
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_18,"I mean, sure... we could do that,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_19,but...
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_20,"I dunno,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_21,I guess I wanna recreate the atmosphere we had before.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_22,Hehe.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_23,I see.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_24,"Well, if that's what makes you happy,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_25,then I appreciate the invitation.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_26,Thanks for understanding :D
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_27,It's always nice having a new group chat!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_28,Queen says it's not bad to have a new chat too! C:
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_29,"You seem to be rubbing off on Ludmilla, Alice."
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_30,It's nice to see Ludmilla embracing her lovable side.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_31,Wow!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_32,"Yeesh,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_33,you make it sound like I'm some kind of ghostly spirit or something XD
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_34,"... Actually, that sounds kinda cool."
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_35,"""You think I'm lovable?"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_36,"You're so brave, Servant."""
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_37,That's what Queen just said.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_38,Glad to see that everyone's already having fun in here.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_39,Totally!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_40,"Oh,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_41,Queen also wants me to tell everyone to be sure
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_42,"that you prepare ahead of time,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_43,and not to forget anything and all that jazz.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_44,Will do.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_45,See you guys later.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_46,"Everything's sorted on my end,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_47,but I'll be sure to double-check.
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_48,See y'all later!
m_ex_alonesurviver_01_49,Later!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_1,Servant!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_2,Tove!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_3,Are you there?!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_4,"Hmm, I guess they didn't land near route A."
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_5,I don't see any footprints or indications of a fall.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_6,What about route B?
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_7,This is bad...
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_8,There's nothing here either.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_9,Where on earth could they have fallen?
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_10,:'(
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_11,Rabbity! Pigeon!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_12,It's no good.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_13,"Actually, Ludmilla,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_14,I think you should leave the phone alone.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_15,It'd be a nightmare
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_16,if we were to lose contact with you too.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_17,I understa
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_18,but
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_19,You tw won be avle to
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_20,"Uh-oh, I think her phone's already toast."
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_21,Stop replying and drop the phone! Now!
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_22,We'll be right there.
m_ex_alonesurviver_02_23,"OMG! I'm on my way, Queen!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_1,Burly Bear!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_2,Tove!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_3,"If you see this message,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_4,please fire off a signal flare!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_5,We'll follow that flare
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_6,"wherever it leads us,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_7,even if it's only a tiny spark.
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_8,You hear me?
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_9,We're going to find you!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_10,That's right!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_11,"We're going to rescue you, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_12,I know we will!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_13,"Queen agrees with me,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_14,so you've got nothing to worry about.
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_15,We will see you again!
m_ex_alonesurviver_03_16,And soon!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_1,Um...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_2,Survivalist...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_3,Who is this?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_4,It's Tove!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_5,Tove?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_6,Yes!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_7,What's with your username?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_8,"Oh, well... it's just that..."
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_9,Is this about recreating the atmosphere again?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_10,No!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_11,"I was just kinda doubting myself, and whether or not I was truly a survival expert,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_12,so
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_13,I thought I'd tell you something
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_14,that I couldn't say in my original profile.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_15,Seems like Ludmilla really got under your skin.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_16,!!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_17,How did you know?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_18,Because you seemed pretty worried back then.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_19,Wow...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_20,"Sometimes,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_21,I think you know me even better than I do.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_22,I...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_23,I haven't responded to Ludmilla's question yet.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_24,"Back when everything I knew was theoretical,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_25,I thought I could do anything as long as I studied hard enough.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_26,I believed deep down in my bones.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_27,But it turns out that I was wrong.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_28,Saving someone...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_29,Rescuing people...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_30,They're not easy decisions to make.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_31,I didn't know the first thing
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_32,"about what Unlimited was meant to do,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_33,or what we were doing here.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_34,I see.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_35,"Once I realized this,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_36,I found it hard to respond to Ludmilla's question.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_37,Could someone like me really hack it out there?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_38,"That thought ran through my mind, haunting me."
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_39,I've begun to wonder if I could ever rescue anyone for real.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_40,But isn't this your true calling?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_41,It is.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_42,"You've watched countless videos just to do this job, haven't you?"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_43,That's true.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_44,"And now that you've tried it, do you dislike it?"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_45,Huh?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_46,N-no!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_47,I like it very much!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_48,It's just...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_49,I'm too clumsy.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_50,I'm afraid that
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_51,"I'll fail,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_52,and that scares me.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_53,Then you just have to try harder.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_54,Huh?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_55,You have to do all you can not to act clumsily in front of anyone who needs rescuing.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_56,...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_57,"You still want to become a survival expert, don't you?"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_58,I...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_59,"Yes,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_60,I do.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_61,I want to be...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_62,a true professional.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_63,Then what else is holding you back?
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_64,...
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_65,"No,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_66,nothing.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_67,Nothing at all!
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_68,"Thank you so much, Survivalist!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_69,"I'll make you proud and become a true professional, promise!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_70,Good. You can do this.
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_71,"Yes, I can!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_04_72,Survival Expert? left the group chat.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_1,Survivalist! Neve!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_2,Have you arrived at the Outpost?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_3,Yep!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_4,I successfully escorted him to the elevator leading to the Outpost.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_5,"I arrived safe and sound, thanks to Neve."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_6,Excellent.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_7,It's too bad
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_8,I couldn't accompany you :(
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_9,"No no, this won't do."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_10,"Pigeon, you ought to go running with Princess!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_11,She can run already?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_12,Sure she can!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_13,"Survivalist,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_14,The Nikke we rescued
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_15,recovered much more quickly
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_16,than we anticipated.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_17,"Once she trains with us a little more,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_18,she'll be able to return back to the Ark.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_19,That's good news.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_20,Definitely!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_21,"You should have seen Pigeon, Rabbity."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_22,She was bawling her eyes out.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_23,She was crying again?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_24,"Yeah, but they were tears of joy :3"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_25,She was so happy that Princess could run.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_26,Alice!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_27,That was supposed to be a secret between you and me!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_28,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_29,I thought that didn't include Rabbity.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_30,Sorry :/
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_31,"It's okay,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_32,Survivalist has already seen many sides of me.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_33,It's okay. It's perfectly normal to cry.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_34,:'(
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_35,"Speaking of which, Neve."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_36,Ludmilla has been asking when you'll be back.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_37,Me?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_38,Hard to say.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_39,"Actually, I'm feeling pretty sleepy,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_40,so I'm on the hunt for a warm place to huddle down for the night.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_41,I noticed that the road near the Northern Base is now cleared.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_42,"Something tells me there will be plenty of good spots there,"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_43,I can just feel it.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_44,I'm gonna go check it out.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_45,You're going alone?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_46,Isn't that dangerous?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_47,I'm exhausted!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_48,I don't think I can hold on and wait for anyone.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_49,Wouldn't it be better to sleep at the base?
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_50,But I want to sleep right now.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_51,"Just hold on until you get there, then you can have a nice, long sleep."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_52,!!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_53,Yeah!
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_54,You've got a point.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_55,I'll think about it.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_56,"Okay, just be careful."
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_57,I will.
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_58,"Take care, Neve!"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_59,"Nanook, we'll be waiting for you <3"
m_ex_alonesurviver_05_60,I'll see you all soon.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_2,You changed your avatar?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_3,Whoa!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_4,You got that quick!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_5,"So, what do you think?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_6,Belorta said she preferred the previous one.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_7,It's super cute.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_8,"I prefer the old one, too."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_9,Omgomgomg!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_10,You think it's cute!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_11,I can't even!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_12,:D
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_13,Thank you!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_14,"Aw man, so you agree with Belorta?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_15,"Still though, I like this one,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_16,so I'm going to keep it for a while.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_17,Hehehe.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_18,"Anyhoo, I'm dying to go back to Snowfield one of these days."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_19,We had such a great time there.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_20,"The hot springs were out of this world,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_21,and the food was spectacular as well.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_22,"Oh yeah, and it was a total blast skipping stones!"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_23,Rattling off all the fun things we did
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_24,only makes me more eager to return.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_25,"How about you, Old-Timer?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_26,Do you want to go there again?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_27,Of course.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_28,"So,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_29,what did you have the most fun doing at Snowfield?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_30,Anything that I did with you.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_31,It's hard to name one.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_32,"Ha, same!"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_33,"Yeah,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_34,that makes sense.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_35,Let's go there again the second we have a chance to.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_36,It's a deal.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_37,Hehe.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_38,"Well, I better get back to cleaning the Toy Store, then."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_01_39,I'll text you later.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_1,Old-Timer!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_2,Are you free now?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_3,"Yeah, what's up?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_4,I've got a bit of a problem.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_5,Can you help me figure something out?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_6,Sure.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_7,I want to get something for Belorta as a gift.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_8,But I don't know what to buy.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_9,"I asked her if she wanted something,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_10,but she didn't tell me anything :(
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_11,What should I get Belorta to make her happy?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_12,A yummy cake.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_13,A doll fashioned after you.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_14,A cake?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_15,That sounds nice.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_16,"Belorta is a big fan of sweets, after all."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_17,"All right, it's settled."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_18,I'll make a cake with Belorta's face on it.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_19,A doll made to look like me?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_20,That sounds nice.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_21,But I don't think I'd be able to buy that anywhere.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_22,I'd have to make one myself.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_23,"If it's a tiny one, like those for a keychain, I think I could pull that off."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_24,I'll show it to you as soon as I'm done with it.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_25,"Thanks for helping me out, Old-Timer!"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_26,No problem.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_27,"Say,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_28,would you like something as a gift as well?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_29,"No, that's okay."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_30,I'd like anything that you give me.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_31,"If you ever want something in the future, don't hesitate to tell me,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_32,and I'll make it happen.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_33,"Ha, really?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_34,Looks like I'll have to add one more item to my list
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_35,when preparing the gift for Belorta.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_36,Looking forward to what you get me.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_37,"All right, I'm off to check out some gifts."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_02_38,See you around!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_1,"Maybe it's because the year is coming to an end,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_2,but I feel a little upset.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_3,And that's despite the fact that this was a very happy year for me!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_4,"What about you, Old-Timer?"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_5,This year is a happy year for me as well.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_6,I just want this year to be over.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_7,"Woah, glad to hear that!"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_8,That's wonderful!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_9,I hope the upcoming year brings you
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_10,all sorts of bliss and happiness as well.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_11,Why is that?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_12,Because I've been swamped with work this entire year.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_13,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_14,"Well, I'm sure that next year will be easier for you."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_15,"Anyway, let's just hope that you can have as many happy moments as possible"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_16,"in the days that remain for this year,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_17,and in the next.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_18,Haha.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_19,"Oh, and one more thing, Old-Timer."
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_20,Thank you for
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_21,being there for me this year.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_22,"I hope that you can continue to be with me next year,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_23,"the year after,"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_24,and the year after that!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_25,I wish for the same.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_26,You do?
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_27,"I'll always be with you, Old-Timer, I swear!"
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_28,You make me feel so loved!
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_29,I should go and tell Belorta that
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_30,I hope I can continue keep her company all of next year as well.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_31,Okay.
m_ex_mica_snowbuddy_03_32,Catch you later!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_1,"Hello, Servant."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_2,I see you changed your avatar.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_3,"Yes, just recently."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_4,It suits you.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_5,Thank you.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_6,Mi C Ca changed it for me

m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_14,RIP
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_15,I wait for a while to make sure that there won't be any further incoming messages.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_16,Apparently Ludmilla broke another phone.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_01_17,Perhaps I should contact her through handwritten letters from here on out.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_1,Service
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_2,Seventh
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_3,...
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_4,Servant!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_5,Yes?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_6,"For a while, there is no further reply."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_7,"Just when I think she has broken another phone, and am about to turn off Bla..."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_8,I heard that!! The app!! Has a new!! Feature!! And I am!! Trying out!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_9,New feature?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_10,Yeah!! If you're asking me what the new feature is...!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_11,Ludmilla!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_12,Why are you shouting!?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_13,Is something wrong!?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_14,??
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_15,Pigeon!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_16,I'm testing out the new feature with Queen!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_17,"Oh, I see!!"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_18,I'll tell Neve that she can go back to sleep!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_19,Thanks!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_20,Make sure to tell Nanook that I'm sorry for waking her!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_21,Sure thing!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_22,What in the world is going on?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_23,Sorry about that!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_24,I heard there's a new speech recognition feature!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_25,So I'm testing it!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_26,"But!! It seems it can recognize!! Alice's and Tove's voices, too!!"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_27,"So, could the whole issue with your hands potentially be resolved now?"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_28,"For a while, there is no reply."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_29,Rabbity!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_30,??
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_31,Queen says she has a sore throat!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_32,And that she'll contact you later!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_33,Couldn't she just quit shouting？
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_34,It is said that you had to speak loud and clear!! So that the machine can understand!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_35,Sounds like the device really needs some improvement.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_36,Even so!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_37,A minor feature like this!!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_38,Is still a great leap!! For me!! Cough cough!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_39,Queen?!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_40,Perhaps we should talk later.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_02_41,Maybe I should send some hot tea to the Northern Base.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_1,"Servant,"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_2,I have a favor to ask you.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_4,We've run out of some bath salts and tea here at Snowfield.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_5,Can you get some for me in the Ark?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_6,Any preferences?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_7,Yes.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_8,I want something jasmine-scented.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_9,"Okay, I'll check it out and let you know if anything is available."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_10,...
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_11,?!
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_12,What happened?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_13,Alice?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_14,What about her?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_15,Neve?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_16,Huh?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_17,Could it be Tove?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_18,Servant?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_19,Is it Ludmilla there?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_20,"Yes, why?"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_21,I think this is the first time you've sent messages for this long.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_22,The speech recognition feature has been improved.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_23,Now I don't need to speak so loud
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_24,for the text to register.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_25,So I can send messages for a longer time without any errors.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_26,Really? I wonder if I could add this feature to Guilty's cellphone.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_27,"Science is a wonderful thing, isn't it?"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_28,Why her?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_29,She has all kinds of trouble with voice recognition software as well.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_30,"Okay, I'll go ask if Tove can help with this."
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_31,Isn't there a saying?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_32,Humans always find the answer.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_33,I think we finally found the answer this time.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_34,But enough about this.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_35,Exchanging messages like this is new for me.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_36,It's great that I was able to solve this problem before the end of the year.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_37,Now I don't have to be physically present to talk with you.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_38,Yeah.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_39,"Before I go,"
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_40,there is one more thing I wanted to tell you.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_41,What's that?
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_42,Thank you for everything you've done this year.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_43,I'm looking forward to being in your presence in the upcoming year as well.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_44,Same here.
m_ex_ludmilla_winterowner_03_45,Hee hee. Catch you later.
m_ex_leona_01_1,"Hello, Zoo Keeper."
m_ex_leona_01_2,Do you remember me?
m_ex_leona_01_3,We've met a few times before.
m_ex_leona_01_4,Remind me again?
m_ex_leona_01_5,Of course I remember you.
m_ex_leona_01_6,What? Are you being serious?
m_ex_leona_01_7,"I'm Leona, from Happy Zoo."
m_ex_leona_01_8,The one always walking around with a pet lion.
m_ex_leona_01_9,"Ah, okay."
m_ex_leona_01_10,Do you remember me now?
m_ex_leona_01_11,... I feel kinda sad all of a sudden.
m_ex_leona_01_12,I knew you would!
m_ex_leona_01_13,"Apparently, we're going to be working together from here on out."
m_ex_leona_01_14,I'm looking forward to it!
m_ex_leona_01_15,As am I.
m_ex_leona_01_16,"So, I have to ask:"
m_ex_leona_01_17,Do you know how to handle big animals?
m_ex_leona_01_18,Why? Will I have to handle them at some point?
m_ex_leona_01_19,"You don't have to, but at the shelter,"
m_ex_leona_01_20,"Biscuit is in charge of the dogs,"
m_ex_leona_01_21,"Nero is in charge of the cats,"
m_ex_leona_01_22,and I'm in charge of all the big animals.
m_ex_leona_01_23,You'll get to meet them next time you swing by.
m_ex_leona_01_24,"Personally, I think it'd be best if you came as often as possible, so that they'll warm up to you."
m_ex_leona_01_25,I'm a bit scared.
m_ex_leona_01_26,Sounds fun.
m_ex_leona_01_27,"They may look scary on the outside,"
m_ex_leona_01_28,"but I've trained them myself, so don't worry."
m_ex_leona_01_29,"They're nothing but big softies,"
m_ex_leona_01_30,the whole lot of 'em.
m_ex_leona_01_31,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_leona_01_32,I'm glad to see you aren't scared at all.
m_ex_leona_01_33,"They're all super well-trained, so they're not a danger to anyone."
m_ex_leona_01_34,"I'm sure you'll all become fast friends, hehe."
m_ex_leona_01_35,"Anyway, Timi is pestering me to get fed."
m_ex_leona_01_36,I'll talk to you later.
m_ex_leona_02_1,"Zoo Keeper,"
m_ex_leona_02_2,we just got a new arrival.
m_ex_leona_02_3,Wanna guess what kind of animal it is?
m_ex_leona_02_4,Can I have some clues?
m_ex_leona_02_5,"It's got a round face and ears,"
m_ex_leona_02_6,and it's super cute.
m_ex_leona_02_7,A dog?
m_ex_leona_02_8,Wrong.
m_ex_leona_02_9,Hmm... give me some more hints.
m_ex_leona_02_10,Okay.
m_ex_leona_02_11,"Normally, it walks on four legs,"
m_ex_leona_02_12,but it can walk on two if it wants to.
m_ex_leona_02_13,A meerkat?
m_ex_leona_02_14,!!
m_ex_leona_02_15,You know about meerkats?
m_ex_leona_02_16,"I'm impressed with how much you know about animals,"
m_ex_leona_02_17,but I'm afraid that's incorrect.
m_ex_leona_02_18,It's bigger than a meerkat.
m_ex_leona_02_19,Is it... a bear?
m_ex_leona_02_20,That's it!
m_ex_leona_02_21,"It's a Kodiak bear, which is one of the biggest bears around."
m_ex_leona_02_22,I brought him here after I found him injured up on the surface.
m_ex_leona_02_23,I thought you said it was cute.
m_ex_leona_02_24,Bears are cute!
m_ex_leona_02_25,They can tear humans limb from limb.
m_ex_leona_02_26,"I've never seen one in person, so I guess I'm not sure."
m_ex_leona_02_27,"Sure, but I've treated and moved him to a safe place."
m_ex_leona_02_28,It'll be fine.
m_ex_leona_02_29,You haven't?
m_ex_leona_02_30,Would you like to take a look?
m_ex_leona_02_31,Can I?
m_ex_leona_02_32,Of course.
m_ex_leona_02_33,"His treatment is nearly finished,"
m_ex_leona_02_34,so just let me know when you've got some spare time.
m_ex_leona_02_35,"Who knows, maybe it'll be love at first sight with you two, hehe."
m_ex_leona_02_36,Looking forward to seeing him.
m_ex_leona_03_1,"Zoo Keeper,"
m_ex_leona_03_2,Timi wants to see you.
m_ex_leona_03_3,Can you come to the shelter now?
m_ex_leona_03_4,I'm a bit busy right now.
m_ex_leona_03_5,You are?
m_ex_leona_03_6,Darn... what should I do?
m_ex_leona_03_7,"I don't know when you two got so close, but he keeps asking for you."
m_ex_leona_03_8,Hmm...
m_ex_leona_03_9,How about this?
m_ex_leona_03_10,I'll transcribe for Timi
m_ex_leona_03_11,"and write down what he says here,"
m_ex_leona_03_12,then relay your responses back to him.
m_ex_leona_03_13,"That way, you two can communicate no problem!"
m_ex_leona_03_14,Certainly sounds interesting.
m_ex_leona_03_15,"Okay,"
m_ex_leona_03_16,wait just a moment.
m_ex_leona_03_17,"Hey, this is Timi."
m_ex_leona_03_18,How are you doing?
m_ex_leona_03_19,Is this really Timi?
m_ex_leona_03_20,"Yes, it's me! I'm a bit nervous."
m_ex_leona_03_21,"Hehe, you should see how anxious he is, Zoo Keeper. It's adorable."
m_ex_leona_03_22,"So, why did you want to see me?"
m_ex_leona_03_23,"You're a good human,"
m_ex_leona_03_24,"and the best person I know, after Leona, of course."
m_ex_leona_03_25,"Awww, thanks, Timi! I'm touched."
m_ex_leona_03_26,"You're a pretty good lion yourself, Timi."
m_ex_leona_03_27,Thanks!
m_ex_leona_03_28,"I'm not sure if you know this,"
m_ex_leona_03_29,"but lately, all Leona talks about is..."
m_ex_leona_03_30,Um...
m_ex_leona_03_31,She talks about you every now and then.
m_ex_leona_03_32,... Did you just change what you were going to say?
m_ex_leona_03_33,No.
m_ex_leona_03_34,"You're not lying to me, are you?"
m_ex_leona_03_35,No!
m_ex_leona_03_36,"It's just that Timi forgot what he was going to say. He's too nervous, hehe."
m_ex_leona_03_37,"I've been telling Timi a lot about you, and he just wants to see you, that's all."
m_ex_leona_03_38,"Actually,"
m_ex_leona_03_39,it's probably for the best that you and Timi can't communicate.
m_ex_leona_03_40,"I've got a few things I need to discuss with him,"
m_ex_leona_03_41,so I'll be off.
m_ex_leona_03_42,Leona? Timi?
m_ex_leona_03_43,There is no reply from Leona.
m_ex_lionheart_01_1,Leona has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_lionheart_01_2,Leona has invited Nero to join the group.
m_ex_lionheart_01_3,Leona has invited Biscuit to join the group.
m_ex_lionheart_01_4,Hmm?
m_ex_lionheart_01_5,What's this all about?
m_ex_lionheart_01_6,"Yeah,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_7,"we are obviously together,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_8,so why'd you create a group chat with everyone?
m_ex_lionheart_01_9,"Although she was pretty confident,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_10,I'm a little worried about Guillotine back at the shelter.
m_ex_lionheart_01_11,I was wondering how she's holding up.
m_ex_lionheart_01_12,"Zoo Keeper,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_13,could you add her to the chat?
m_ex_lionheart_01_14,Sure.
m_ex_lionheart_01_15,{AccountData.NickName} has invited Guillotine to join the group.
m_ex_lionheart_01_16,!!!
m_ex_lionheart_01_17,I am a being for whom darkness is my dwelling.
m_ex_lionheart_01_18,Who dares summon me
m_ex_lionheart_01_19,into this unknown space?
m_ex_lionheart_01_20,It was me.
m_ex_lionheart_01_21,"Ah, Partner!"
m_ex_lionheart_01_22,"I asked him to invite you, hehe."
m_ex_lionheart_01_23,"So, you all are here as well?"
m_ex_lionheart_01_24,This is not good.
m_ex_lionheart_01_25,"This may sound alarming to you all,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_26,but you must never tell anyone that you were in the same space as me.
m_ex_lionheart_01_27,Not a word!
m_ex_lionheart_01_28,"If you let it slip that we were together,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_29,you yourselves might end up in the Big O's crosshairs.
m_ex_lionheart_01_30,Yikes.
m_ex_lionheart_01_31,"Don't worry, we won't mention anything."
m_ex_lionheart_01_32,"Yeah, we won't tell a soul."
m_ex_lionheart_01_33,"By the way,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_34,are the dogs having a good time?
m_ex_lionheart_01_35,And don't forget the cats.
m_ex_lionheart_01_36,I just took the dogs on a walk.
m_ex_lionheart_01_37,Seeing them become so affectionate for a nobody like me got me thinking:
m_ex_lionheart_01_38,Perhaps even a damned soul like myself is capable of being loved.
m_ex_lionheart_01_39,The cats are frolicking around.
m_ex_lionheart_01_40,They're enjoying their solitude.
m_ex_lionheart_01_41,"In fact, they remind me of myself."
m_ex_lionheart_01_42,That's great!
m_ex_lionheart_01_43,"Thanks, Guillotine."
m_ex_lionheart_01_44,"There can be a learning curve when it comes to taking care of cats,"
m_ex_lionheart_01_45,but it sounds like you've got it down pat.
m_ex_lionheart_01_46,But of course. Did you expect anything less?
m_ex_lionheart_01_47,Sounds like things are going quite nicely over there.
m_ex_lionheart_01_48,I'm glad.
m_ex_lionheart_01_49,Are you not curious about Timi de Vista?
m_ex_lionheart_01_50,"I'm sure you're taking good care of him, so I'm not worried."
m_ex_lionheart_01_51,I appreciate the vote of confidence.
m_ex_lionheart_01_52,"Don't worry, I've got things covered on this end."
m_ex_lionheart_01_53,"Okay, much appreciated."
m_ex_lionheart_01_54,Thanks!
m_ex_lionheart_01_55,"Thank you, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_02_1,"Sorry for bothering you all at this late hour,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_2,but I just wanted to express my gratitude to Guillotine
m_ex_lionheart_02_3,for taking such good care of the animals.
m_ex_lionheart_02_4,I'm also incredibly grateful to you for taking the harassment from the fanatics in stride.
m_ex_lionheart_02_5,"Yeah, thanks a bunch."
m_ex_lionheart_02_6,"I was talking with the dogs,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_7,and they said they had a blast.
m_ex_lionheart_02_8,"Usually, they're a bit restless when it's time for bed,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_9,but they're all sawing logs right now.
m_ex_lionheart_02_10,You're amazing!
m_ex_lionheart_02_11,The cats all look like they had fun as well.
m_ex_lionheart_02_12,"They've been talking about you all day, Guillotine."
m_ex_lionheart_02_13,"Thank you, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_02_14,Glad to be of service.
m_ex_lionheart_02_15,"However, I must remain in the shadows,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_16,so I think I will have to leave this group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_02_17,That's too bad.
m_ex_lionheart_02_18,"So, whenever I need you,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_19,all I do is look in the sky and shout your name?
m_ex_lionheart_02_20,Precisely.
m_ex_lionheart_02_21,"Our fates are all intertwined, and reside under the same sheltering sky."
m_ex_lionheart_02_22,"Say my name, and I will hear your call."
m_ex_lionheart_02_23,All right.
m_ex_lionheart_02_24,"Since I cannot leave any trace,"
m_ex_lionheart_02_25,I must go.
m_ex_lionheart_02_26,Guillotine left the group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_02_27,Phew.
m_ex_lionheart_02_28,How have things been since we left the shelter?
m_ex_lionheart_02_29,Fine.
m_ex_lionheart_02_30,Just fine.
m_ex_lionheart_02_31,"Oh right, Zoo Keeper."
m_ex_lionheart_02_32,There was something I wanted to talk to you about.
m_ex_lionheart_02_33,Could I come see you tomorrow morning?
m_ex_lionheart_02_34,Sure.
m_ex_lionheart_02_35,"All right, it's getting late, so I'll quit pestering you guys."
m_ex_lionheart_02_36,"Goodnight, everyone!"
m_ex_lionheart_02_37,Goodnight.
m_ex_lionheart_02_38,"Night, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_03_1,"Hey, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_03_2,What's everyone up to?
m_ex_lionheart_03_3,"Hi, Nero!"
m_ex_lionheart_03_4,We just finished eating.
m_ex_lionheart_03_5,What about you?
m_ex_lionheart_03_6,"I fed all the animals,"
m_ex_lionheart_03_7,"so now I'm lying on the roof, relaxing."
m_ex_lionheart_03_8,How are the animals
m_ex_lionheart_03_9,enjoying the surface?
m_ex_lionheart_03_10,They're super excited!
m_ex_lionheart_03_11,Even Timi came back late since he was busy roaming around.
m_ex_lionheart_03_12,"Actually, I was kinda surprised."
m_ex_lionheart_03_13,Leona didn't even notice that he was gone.
m_ex_lionheart_03_14,???
m_ex_lionheart_03_15,You're serious?
m_ex_lionheart_03_16,Absolutely.
m_ex_lionheart_03_17,Hmm...
m_ex_lionheart_03_18,It doesn't appear that Leona or Scoops are reading the messages.
m_ex_lionheart_03_19,"Leona is putting the animals to bed,"
m_ex_lionheart_03_20,and Trainer went in to sleep.
m_ex_lionheart_03_21,I see.
m_ex_lionheart_03_22,Keep doing what you can
m_ex_lionheart_03_23,to support Leona.
m_ex_lionheart_03_24,???
m_ex_lionheart_03_25,What do you mean?
m_ex_lionheart_03_26,I'm just saying. Do what I tell you.
m_ex_lionheart_03_27,Fine.
m_ex_lionheart_03_28,I'm going to sleep myself.
m_ex_lionheart_03_29,"Sweet dreams, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_03_30,You too.
m_ex_lionheart_04_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_lionheart_04_2,"Scoops,"
m_ex_lionheart_04_3,are you busy right now?
m_ex_lionheart_04_4,"You're not gonna believe this, Trainer!"
m_ex_lionheart_04_5,It's pandemonium over here.
m_ex_lionheart_04_6,What's the matter?
m_ex_lionheart_04_7,We decided to take advantage of the fact that the big animals were no longer around
m_ex_lionheart_04_8,and clean the shelter.
m_ex_lionheart_04_9,"The only thing is, Nero and the cats are afraid of water, so they locked the door and hid."
m_ex_lionheart_04_10,"Meanwhile, all the spraying water has got the dogs in a tizzy."
m_ex_lionheart_04_11,Trying to clean while taking care of the dogs at the same time
m_ex_lionheart_04_12,is near-impossible.
m_ex_lionheart_04_13,"It's the first time we've done a deep clean like this,"
m_ex_lionheart_04_14,"and we've got a lot of ground to cover, which makes it tough."
m_ex_lionheart_04_15,Are you okay? Do you need my help?
m_ex_lionheart_04_16,"No, I don't think it will change anything."
m_ex_lionheart_04_17,It'll just result in one more miserable person.
m_ex_lionheart_04_18,I just wanted to let you know not to come to the shelter for a while.
m_ex_lionheart_04_19,"No, don't listen to her."
m_ex_lionheart_04_20,You can come and help with organizing.
m_ex_lionheart_04_21,This would all be going much faster if you came out of the room.
m_ex_lionheart_04_22,You know how much I hate water!
m_ex_lionheart_04_23,I said at the very beginning that we should have done it one room at a time.
m_ex_lionheart_04_24,I'm sorry for spraying water everywhere...
m_ex_lionheart_04_25,"I got too excited, that's all."
m_ex_lionheart_04_26,...
m_ex_lionheart_04_27,Looking at all these empty cages is bumming me out.
m_ex_lionheart_04_28,"At least I don't have much time to dwell on it, thanks to you two."
m_ex_lionheart_04_29,Erm... is that intended as a compliment?
m_ex_lionheart_04_30,"Yes, it is."
m_ex_lionheart_04_31,"Anyway, it'd be best if you steer clear of the shelter for a while, Zoo Keeper."
m_ex_lionheart_04_32,Things are a bit hectic over here.
m_ex_lionheart_04_33,Got it.
m_ex_lionheart_05_1,"Ever since Guillotine left,"
m_ex_lionheart_05_2,it's been just us
m_ex_lionheart_05_3,in this group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_4,And?
m_ex_lionheart_05_5,Don't we already have a Happy Zoo group chat?
m_ex_lionheart_05_6,You're right.
m_ex_lionheart_05_7,"If we keep this one going, it might get confusing."
m_ex_lionheart_05_8,We should leave this one.
m_ex_lionheart_05_9,"All right,"
m_ex_lionheart_05_10,let's move everything back to the regular group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_11,Biscuit left the group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_12,"See ya, meow."
m_ex_lionheart_05_13,Nero left the group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_14,Ah.
m_ex_lionheart_05_15,Hmm...
m_ex_lionheart_05_16,"By the way,"
m_ex_lionheart_05_17,I talked to Mustang.
m_ex_lionheart_05_18,There weren't any major issues.
m_ex_lionheart_05_19,Are you sure? I heard they stripped you of your animal care qualifications.
m_ex_lionheart_05_20,So you already heard.
m_ex_lionheart_05_21,"It's true, but they can be easily regained by taking a simple test."
m_ex_lionheart_05_22,There's no need to get bent out of shape over it.
m_ex_lionheart_05_23,Considering how flagrant a violation
m_ex_lionheart_05_24,"releasing captive animals back to the surface is,"
m_ex_lionheart_05_25,I was worried that I might be expelled from the squad.
m_ex_lionheart_05_26,I should be grateful that it basically ended with a slap on the wrist.
m_ex_lionheart_05_27,"Thanks again for all your help, Zoo Keeper."
m_ex_lionheart_05_28,I'll talk to you later in the group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_29,Okay.
m_ex_lionheart_05_30,Leona left the group chat.
m_ex_lionheart_05_31,It feels a bit sad to let this group chat fade into nothing.
m_ex_lionheart_05_32,I think I'll keep it around as a keepsake.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_1,Trainer!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_2,We had a dog come into the shelter recently that looks just like you!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_3,Really?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_4,Ah.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_5,Are you talking about that big dog?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_6,That's the one!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_7,"He's a big fella, with a personality to match, so he gets along well with Timi."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_8,"I didn't really notice a resemblance before,"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_9,but now that you mention it...
m_ex_happyzoo_03_10,Can you tell me more about him?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_11,"He's got a long, pointed muzzle,"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_12,"slightly upturned eyes,"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_13,and perky ears that stick straight up.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_14,He's also got an unusual bark.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_15,It's waaaaaay lower than usual.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_16,"Instead of ""woof woof"","
m_ex_happyzoo_03_17,"it's more like a ""hwwwaaah"""
m_ex_happyzoo_03_18,Wow!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_19,Interesting.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_20,Are you saying that's how I sound?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_21,"Not really, just the overall feeling."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_22,"Soooo... I'm like a dog, is that it?"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_23,Yeah!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_24,You really are!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_25,...
m_ex_happyzoo_03_26,Um...
m_ex_happyzoo_03_27,What?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_28,Why'd everyone go quiet?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_29,Looking like a dog is a compliment!
m_ex_happyzoo_03_30,No one ever takes being compared to a dog positively.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_31,Really?
m_ex_happyzoo_03_32,"With a puppy, maybe. But a dog? No way."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_33,But puppies are cute and cuddly.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_34,Trainer is super cool.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_35,"That may be true, but..."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_36,It's fine. I'm glad you meant it as a compliment.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_37,"Whoa, really?"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_38,"I'll tell it to you more often, then."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_39,"Still... it's not really a thing you should be saying to people,"
m_ex_happyzoo_03_40,so try not to say it too often.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_41,Okie dokie.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_42,You're lucky Scoops is so understanding.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_43,That he is.
m_ex_happyzoo_03_44,"The next time you come by, we can show you your canine doppelganger."
m_ex_happyzoo_03_45,I'm interested to see him for myself.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_1,"Everyone,"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_2,I thought of something super duper fun!
m_ex_happyzoo_04_3,What is it?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_4,What's up?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_5,You know how Nero is always saying
m_ex_happyzoo_04_6,"""meow"" at the end of her sentences?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_7,I figured we all should do the same.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_8,I'll say
m_ex_happyzoo_04_9,"""woof""."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_10,What about me?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_11,"How about ""graul""?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_12,"Hehe, this is kinda fun, graul."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_13,"You sound like you're choking on something, meow."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_14,"What about you, Trainer?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_15,I have to do it as well?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_16,"Of course, woof!"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_17,I can't really think of anything.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_18,I've got it.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_19,"Remember that dog we mentioned before, graul?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_20,The one that looks like Scoops?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_21,"Sure, I remember."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_22,How about we use the sound of his bark?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_23,"That's a great idea, woof!"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_24,"In that case, you should go with ""hwwwaaah"", Trainer."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_25,"All right, fine... hwwwaaah."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_26,"Hehe, so cute."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_27,"But why are we doing this to begin with, graul?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_28,"If we talk like this,"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_29,I think the consistency of it
m_ex_happyzoo_04_30,"will make for a nice team-building exercise, woof."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_31,Woof...
m_ex_happyzoo_04_32,"I'm... not so sure about that, graul."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_33,"Yeah... now that we're actually trying it out, you may be right, woof."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_34,"It doesn't feel this forced when Nero does it, woof."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_35,"Right, hwwwaaah."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_36,"That's because ""meow"" is its own unique thing, meow."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_37,Why don't you try it?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_38,Just add meow to the end of our sentences?
m_ex_happyzoo_04_39,"As simple as this, meow?"
m_ex_happyzoo_04_40,"Of course not, meow."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_41,"There's an art to it, meow."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_42,"Wow, seems like there are all kinds of different ways to use it."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_43,I guess there's a reason only Nero can get away with doing it.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_44,Precisely.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_45,"I'm inimitable, meow."
m_ex_happyzoo_04_46,Hmm...
m_ex_happyzoo_04_47,I need to do a bit more research.
m_ex_happyzoo_04_48,"Thanks for trying this out with me, everyone!"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_1,Sugar has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_2,Sugar has invited Moran to join the group.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_3,?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_4,What's going on?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_5,I don't get what the name of this group is getting at.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_6,"""Client Payments""?"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_7,It means exactly what it says.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_8,"Since we've received a formal request,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_9,we should be paid accordingly once we've completed said request.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_10,"You haven't even started yet,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_11,and you're already talking about payment?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_12,Of course.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_13,You can't imagine the amount of people who ask for our help and then vanish into thin air.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_14,We make group chats like this
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_15,as a contingency to prevent such things from occurring.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_16,I see.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_17,"So, just to confirm:"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_18,We'll be launching an investigation into the Outer Rim
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_19,"in an attempt to clear Moran's name,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_20,who is our client this time around.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_21,Have I got everything?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_22,"Yes, that's all correct."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_23,"Upon completion of this request,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_24,we will receive remuneration in the amount of 10 million Credits.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_25,Is that correct?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_26,Correct.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_27,Are you sure that's the correct amount?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_28,Hmm?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_29,Wait a minute.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_30,Why is it 10 million Credits?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_31,"I'm sorry, I didn't see it clearly. Let's check again."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_32,"Sorry, but you already agreed."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_33,No takebacks.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_34,Don't be absurd.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_35,10 million Credits is an astronomical amount.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_36,Is it?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_37,Listen.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_38,Even if I were okay
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_39,"with paying that much,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_40,I don't have that much money.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_41,"Come on, you're the boss of the Peony Association."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_42,You must be flush with cash.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_43,What are you trying to do?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_44,You know what dire straits we're in.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_45,"Actually, no, I don't know."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_46,...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_47,"Cadet, say something."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_48,Why don't we all meet and discuss the finer points of the payment?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_49,"Yes, something like this should be discussed in person."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_50,"Ugh, fine."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_51,Forget about it.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_01_52,Just hurry and get yourself over to the Outpost.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_2,Cadet.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_3,Is this Moran?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_4,"Yes, it's me."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_5,Why did you change your name?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_6,I don't want to get caught by Sugar.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_7,"Considering that she stole you from me,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_8,I doubt she'd appreciate me talking to you alone.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_9,"Anyway,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_10,I...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_11,I wanted to apologize again.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_12,I'm really sorry about before.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_13,It's okay.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_14,How can I put this...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_15,"I know this might sound strange,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_16,but those people
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_17,who were hooked on Mist...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_18,they seemed so desperate.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_19,As though they were begging for their own lives.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_20,Crying out
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_21,for someone to save them.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_22,I couldn't just leave them.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_23,I know Sugar is right in saying that
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_24,"we were lucky to have gotten away,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_25,"and that there's no guarantee we'll be so lucky next time,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_26,so I just wanted to let you know that I'll protect you.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_27,I've got your back.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_28,So don't be afraid.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_29,Okay?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_30,"If you ever need anything, just turn around and call for me,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_31,and I'll be there before you know it.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_02_32,"Thank you, Moran."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_1,Cadet.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_2,Cadet!
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_3,What were you
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_4,and Sugar talking about?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_5,Cadet?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_6,Cadet???
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_7,Darn...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_8,"I'm dying to know,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_9,but it's not like I can eavesdrop.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_10,Fine.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_11,An assassin never listens in
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_12,on someone else's conversation.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_13,It's in our code of honor.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_14,Haha.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_15,"But be truthful with me,"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_16,what are you doing so close to Sugar?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_17,What are you whispering in each others' ears?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_18,Wait...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_19,I'm getting déjà vu.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_20,This reminds me of
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_21,how Sakura and Rosanna would talk to each other without me.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_22,...
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_23,!!
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_24,Cadet!
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_25,Did you turn off notifications?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_26,Is your phone out of battery?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_27,Read my texts!
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_28,"All right, we're nearly there."
m_ex_dirtybackyard_03_29,Be sure to let me know when you see my messages!
m_ex_dirtybackyard_04_1,Are you okay?
m_ex_dirtybackyard_04_2,My message isn't showing as read.
m_ex_dirtybackyard_04_3,"If you see this, please contact me, okay?"
m_ex_dirtybackyard_04_4,I hope that Moran is okay.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_2,guys.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_3,There's something I've been wanting to ask.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_4,How do you manage your subordinates?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_5,?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_6,^^
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_7,What kind of a moronic question is that?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_8,Where is this coming from?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_9,Er...
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_10,"It's coming from me, who else?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_11,"That's not what I mean,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_12,you simpleton.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_13,Let me ask YOU something: What's your job?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_14,Me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_15,I'm the boss of the Peony Association.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_16,"You have the gall to call yourself that,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_17,and at the same time ask us how to manage your own subordinates?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_18,It's like
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_19,a chef asking a customer
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_20,how to cook something!
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_21,"No way, those are totally different!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_22,I'm not asking about how to cook anything.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_23,^^
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_24,"Honestly,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_25,I can feel your stupidity
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_26,rubbing off on me.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_27,This is what my phone was vibrating non-stop for?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_28,It was hardly worth me checking at all.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_29,I'm turning off notifications.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_30,"Hey, wait!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_31,Why would you do that?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_32,"... Cadet,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_33,was my question really that strange?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_34,"A little bit, yeah."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_35,I thought it was a perfectly valid question.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_36,You see?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_37,We're not the only ones who feel that way.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_38,This can't be!
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_39,"I never expected to hear you say something like that, Cadet."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_40,You heard that?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_41,"I knew I could count on you,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_42,Cadet.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_43,"What made you ask that question in the first place, though?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_44,"Well,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_45,I like to keep things casual at the Peony Association.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_46,"We're like one big family, and so my subordinates act pretty relaxed around me."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_47,"Other organizations are much more stringent with their regulations,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_48,so I was curious to see how they functioned.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_49,"Ah,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_50,so that's it.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_51,"You're wondering how to better wrangle your subordinates,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_52,is that it?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_53,"Yeah, I'm curious."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_54,"All right,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_55,then come find me at the park.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_56,I'll tell you exactly what you want to hear.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_57,^^
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_58,Really?
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_59,I'm on my way!
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_60,"Mister, would you like to come and see the show?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_61,It's gonna be a whole lotta fun.
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_62,^^
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_63,"For some reason, I have an uneasy feeling about all this."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_64,"Sorry, I'm a bit busy."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_65,"Aw darn, that's too bad."
m_ex_underworldqueen_03_66,See you later!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_1,We all should
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_2,hold a sports competition too!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_3,That sounds fun.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_4,Kinda sounds like it'd be a pain.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_5,It'd be a total blast!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_6,"I'm so excited to try it,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_7,that I can't stop grinning!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_8,I don't see what'd be so hard about it.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_9,"All of our jobs are labor-intensive,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_10,so a sports competition would be perfect!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_11,A sports competition?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_12,Where'd you get this idea from all of a sudden?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_13,Huh?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_14,Isn't it obvious?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_15,She probably saw it in one of her anime shows.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_16,Whoa!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_17,How'd you know?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_18,Ah!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_19,Did you also see that episode
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_20,of Brave Pedal last night?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_21,What on earth are you talking about?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_22,It's this anime that's trending right now.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_23,It's about female cycling competitions.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_24,"It airs at midnight,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_25,and last night's episode was all about a big cycling race.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_26,What the...
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_27,How do you know all this?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_28,Are you a fan of the show as well?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_29,?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_30,O-of course not!
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_31,"It's just that my subordinates are always watching it,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_32,"and every once in a while, I overhear what's going on in the show."
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_33,Just admit that you love the show.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_34,"Anyways, let's do this!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_35,"Each of our organizations can be a team,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_36,and Cadet can be the referee.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_37,Huh? Me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_38,"Oooh, Mister will be participating too?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_39,Now it's a little more tempting.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_40,^^
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_41,"If {AccountData.NickName}-kun is the referee, then I'm in."
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_42,That way
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_43,we can consider it a teambuilding exercise.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_44,I haven't agreed to anything yet...
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_45,"Well,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_46,are you in or out?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_47,Hurry up and make a decision.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_48,"Scared that you're gonna lose,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_49,Rosanna?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_50,What?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_51,You must be.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_52,"Otherwise, why would you be running from my challenge?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_53,You think I'm refusing
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_54,out of fear I might lose?
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_55,Don't make me laugh.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_56,"If it's not that,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_57,then it must mean you don't have enough faith in your subordinates.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_58,"Listen, you two morons,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_59,I'll show you what happens to those who doubt me.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_60,"Give me a time and a place,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_61,and I'll be there.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_62,Just don't come crying to me later and try to bail out.
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_63,"Oh trust me, that won't happen."
m_ex_underworldqueen_04_64,Darn right it won't!
m_ex_moran_01_1,"Cadet, good to see you!"
m_ex_moran_01_2,Who is this?
m_ex_moran_01_3,Huh?
m_ex_moran_01_4,"It's me, Moran!"
m_ex_moran_01_5,The boss of the Peony Association!
m_ex_moran_01_6,I've been like an older sister to you
m_ex_moran_01_7,for a while now.
m_ex_moran_01_8,Are you trying to hurt my feelings or something?
m_ex_moran_01_9,I was just pulling your leg.
m_ex_moran_01_10,Jeez... I thought you were actually being serious for a second.
m_ex_moran_01_11,I was about to go out and hunt you down.
m_ex_moran_01_12,"Anyway,"
m_ex_moran_01_13,it's nice contacting you privately.
m_ex_moran_01_14,That way nobody else will bother us.
m_ex_moran_01_15,You mean Rosanna?
m_ex_moran_01_16,You mean Sakura?
m_ex_moran_01_17,"Yeah, her and Sakura."
m_ex_moran_01_18,"Yeah, her and Rosanna."
m_ex_moran_01_19,Those two always have a pointed barb for me.
m_ex_moran_01_20,Ah!
m_ex_moran_01_21,Did you know that we're all part of the same squad?
m_ex_moran_01_22,"Rosanna is the boss of Hedonia,"
m_ex_moran_01_23,"Sakura is the boss of Seimeikai,"
m_ex_moran_01_24,and I'm the boss of the Peony Association.
m_ex_moran_01_25,The three of us together make up the Underworld Queen Squad.
m_ex_moran_01_26,"At the Peony Association,"
m_ex_moran_01_27,our members value loyalty above all else.
m_ex_moran_01_28,"I presume that as their leader, you feel the same way?"
m_ex_moran_01_29,Of course.
m_ex_moran_01_30,An assassin is nothing without loyalty.
m_ex_moran_01_31,We live and die by that creed.
m_ex_moran_01_32,What do you think?
m_ex_moran_01_33,I came up with the slogan myself.
m_ex_moran_01_34,Isn't it cool?
m_ex_moran_01_35,"Actually,"
m_ex_moran_01_36,"now that I think of it,"
m_ex_moran_01_37,it's about time I get back to work.
m_ex_moran_01_38,"I'll contact you later, Cadet."
m_ex_moran_02_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_moran_02_2,Cadet!
m_ex_moran_02_3,Are my messages coming through?
m_ex_moran_02_4,Are you getting them?
m_ex_moran_02_5,"Darn, are they not sending again?"
m_ex_moran_02_6,"Come on, send..."
m_ex_moran_02_7,SEND!
m_ex_moran_02_8,I'm getting them.
m_ex_moran_02_9,"Oh,"
m_ex_moran_02_10,good!
m_ex_moran_02_11,Is there an emergency?
m_ex_moran_02_12,"No, nothing like that."
m_ex_moran_02_13,"I messaged you a while back and never got a response,"
m_ex_moran_02_14,so I thought you were busy.
m_ex_moran_02_15,"When I checked again later,"
m_ex_moran_02_16,I got a notification saying my message had failed to send.
m_ex_moran_02_17,"So I kept sending more,"
m_ex_moran_02_18,and now it seems like they all came through at once.
m_ex_moran_02_19,"Ugh, these hiccups with technology are so annoying."
m_ex_moran_02_20,"If you ask me,"
m_ex_moran_02_21,meeting in person is much easier.
m_ex_moran_02_22,Don't you think so?
m_ex_moran_02_23,"Actually, I find messaging more convenient."
m_ex_moran_02_24,"I agree, meeting in person is much simpler."
m_ex_moran_02_25,Really?
m_ex_moran_02_26,How come?
m_ex_moran_02_27,Because I can contact someone no matter where they are.
m_ex_moran_02_28,Hmm... I guess you've got a point.
m_ex_moran_02_29,"Even if you're, say... indisposed, I could still get in touch with you."
m_ex_moran_02_30,"Like if you're using the toilet,"
m_ex_moran_02_31,or when in the shower.
m_ex_moran_02_32,You think so?
m_ex_moran_02_33,I knew you and I would agree on this!
m_ex_moran_02_34,Nothing beats
m_ex_moran_02_35,face-to-face communication.
m_ex_moran_02_36,"You can really connect with someone instead of sending fragmented, piecemeal messages."
m_ex_moran_02_37,It's especially annoying
m_ex_moran_02_38,when whoever you're talking to suddenly goes incommunicado.
m_ex_moran_02_39,Half the time it feels like I'm talking to a wall.
m_ex_moran_02_40,"So,"
m_ex_moran_02_41,"even if it might take a while 'cause they're far away,"
m_ex_moran_02_42,"or even up on the surface,"
m_ex_moran_02_43,I prefer meeting someone in person.
m_ex_moran_02_44,Right.
m_ex_moran_02_45,"Even though I feel Moran's example is a tad extreme, I don't say anything."
m_ex_moran_02_46,"Oh, and one more thing."
m_ex_moran_02_47,"For a while, there are no further messages from Moran."
m_ex_moran_02_48,Cadet!
m_ex_moran_02_49,Cadet!!!
m_ex_moran_02_50,"Argh, what is wrong with this damn thing?! Not again!"
m_ex_moran_02_51,"Sorry, but I'm heading over to you."
m_ex_moran_02_52,I can't take this anymore.
m_ex_moran_02_53,Just hang on and wait for me.
m_ex_moran_02_54,All of the messages arrive simultaneously once Moran arrives.
m_ex_moran_03_1,Cadet!
m_ex_moran_03_2,"If you're free later, come and swing by the Peony Association."
m_ex_moran_03_3,I have something to give you.
m_ex_moran_03_4,What is it?
m_ex_moran_03_5,A badge.
m_ex_moran_03_6,What for?
m_ex_moran_03_7,Hmm...
m_ex_moran_03_8,It's actually a badge that every member of the Peony Association carries.
m_ex_moran_03_9,"So as long as you carry this badge, no one will mess with you."
m_ex_moran_03_10,I thought it would be prudent for you to carry one as well.
m_ex_moran_03_11,"In case you're worried about it looking weird or tacky,"
m_ex_moran_03_12,fear not!
m_ex_moran_03_13,It's got an imprint of a golden dragon on it.
m_ex_moran_03_14,What made you decide on a dragon?
m_ex_moran_03_15,"Oh right, I guess you wouldn't know."
m_ex_moran_03_16,The golden dragon is the symbol of the Peony Association.
m_ex_moran_03_17,... Not the peony flower?
m_ex_moran_03_18,I can see why you'd think that.
m_ex_moran_03_19,"Despite our name,"
m_ex_moran_03_20,the peony flower is in fact not our symbol.
m_ex_moran_03_21,"Flowers are weak and fragile,"
m_ex_moran_03_22,"so a long time ago, my grandfather decided to change our symbol to a dragon."
m_ex_moran_03_23,"Dragons symbolize wealth, power,"
m_ex_moran_03_24,and longevity.
m_ex_moran_03_25,I have it engraved on my clothes and my weapon.
m_ex_moran_03_26,"When my grandfather was alive, this symbol was reserved strictly for the boss."
m_ex_moran_03_27,It was forbidden for just about anyone else to wear this symbol.
m_ex_moran_03_28,"I never quite understood that, myself."
m_ex_moran_03_29,Subordinates are an indispensable part of any organization.
m_ex_moran_03_30,"Without them, I wouldn't be the boss of anything."
m_ex_moran_03_31,That's why I decided not to hoard the symbol for myself.
m_ex_moran_03_32,"At first, I tried to have it sewn onto the clothing of all my subordinates,"
m_ex_moran_03_33,but Jin and the others were all against it.
m_ex_moran_03_34,"They clutched their pearls and said it was against tradition,"
m_ex_moran_03_35,how it'd obscure what should be the clear hierarchy between a boss and their subordinates.
m_ex_moran_03_36,"Blah blah blah, and so it went."
m_ex_moran_03_37,So I just went and made a badge.
m_ex_moran_03_38,Haha.
m_ex_moran_03_39,No one had a problem with that.
m_ex_moran_03_40,That's very kind of you.
m_ex_moran_03_41,You're so cool.
m_ex_moran_03_42,Huh?
m_ex_moran_03_43,You call this kindness?
m_ex_moran_03_44,I just think it's the natural thing to do.
m_ex_moran_03_45,"If a team wins a competition,"
m_ex_moran_03_46,that doesn't mean the leader should be the only one who gets the prize.
m_ex_moran_03_47,Haha.
m_ex_moran_03_48,Hearing you say that gives me a real ego boost.
m_ex_moran_03_49,Be assured that I'll have your back going forward.
m_ex_moran_03_50,You can always depend on me. Always.
m_ex_moran_03_51,"Cadet,"
m_ex_moran_03_52,"I consider you family,"
m_ex_moran_03_53,so I hope you'll accept this badge.
m_ex_moran_03_54,"I will, thank you."
m_ex_moran_03_55,Good!
m_ex_moran_03_56,"Just let me know when you're free,"
m_ex_moran_03_57,and I'll be waiting for you.
m_mainafter_26_01_1,Uuugggghhh!
m_mainafter_26_01_2,I feel like I've been sorting through supplies foreverrrrrrr!
m_mainafter_26_01_3,Why the heck did they send up so much?
m_mainafter_26_01_4,"Still, it's kinda awesome having all this stuff around."
m_mainafter_26_01_5,"Makes this place feel more like our turf, you know?"
m_mainafter_26_01_6,Hmm...
m_mainafter_26_01_7,That's true.
m_mainafter_26_01_8,That's also the reason behind sending up our personal belongings.
m_mainafter_26_01_9,"Oh, that reminds me!"
m_mainafter_26_01_10,"Did you bring that thing, Rapi?"
m_mainafter_26_01_11,Bring what?
m_mainafter_26_01_12,That cassette player Red Hood gave you.
m_mainafter_26_01_13,I brought it.
m_mainafter_26_01_14,Did you listen to some music on it?
m_mainafter_26_01_15,"Yeah, every time I have a spare moment."
m_mainafter_26_01_16,"Oh, really?"
m_mainafter_26_01_17,Doesn't that make you feel like a granny? Kek!
m_mainafter_26_01_18,It's certainly not what I'd usually be listening to.
m_mainafter_26_01_19,It's such an antique that finding power is a hassle.
m_mainafter_26_01_20,"Still, I'm trying to get used to it."
m_mainafter_26_01_21,What type of music do you prefer?
m_mainafter_26_01_22,Me?
m_mainafter_26_01_23,Actually...
m_mainafter_26_01_24,"Now that I think about it, I don't exactly have a favorite genre."
m_mainafter_26_01_25,"First of all, it's pretty clear that the country vibe just doesn't suit you."
m_mainafter_26_01_26,Might as well give it a try
m_mainafter_26_01_27,since Red Hood left this for me.
m_mainafter_26_01_28,I wanna listen to it too.
m_mainafter_26_01_29,"Yeah, play it for us the next time!"
m_mainafter_26_01_30,Okay.
m_mainafter_26_01_31,"By the way, Commander,"
m_mainafter_26_01_32,did you send Red Hood's recording to the Pilgrims?
m_mainafter_26_01_33,"I've been trying, but the connection is so bad."
m_mainafter_26_01_34,They've probably wandered off into the boonies again.
m_mainafter_26_01_35,Wonder if they'll be cool with us sending them this?
m_mainafter_26_01_36,"I mean, we could just be reopening old wounds."
m_mainafter_26_01_37,I think they'll like it.
m_mainafter_26_01_38,Really?
m_mainafter_26_01_39,I sure hope so.
m_mainafter_27_01_1,Um...
m_mainafter_27_01_2,"I get that taking bold new steps and forging a path to a new world is exciting,"
m_mainafter_27_01_3,but is this really the right move?
m_mainafter_27_01_4,Of course!
m_mainafter_27_01_5,Things have always panned out for us before.
m_mainafter_27_01_6,It's not us that I'm worried about.
m_mainafter_27_01_7,It's Ark that concerns me.
m_mainafter_27_01_8,What about the Ark?
m_mainafter_27_01_9,There are still loads of issues left unresolved.
m_mainafter_27_01_10,Exactly.
m_mainafter_27_01_11,"You know, what's really getting under my skin is Dorothy."
m_mainafter_27_01_12,Can you believe she's snagged herself a dedicated channel on the Ark?
m_mainafter_27_01_13,Who knows what she'll do with it?
m_mainafter_27_01_14,Maybe she just wants to do some live streams or something?
m_mainafter_27_01_15,I'm sure there's a demand to see ladies of her stature on screen.
m_mainafter_27_01_16,I suppose so.
m_mainafter_27_01_17,Hmm...
m_mainafter_27_01_18,"Maybe that'd be a big hit,"
m_mainafter_27_01_19,but something tells me she's got her sights on something bigger.
m_mainafter_27_01_20,Something bigger?
m_mainafter_27_01_21,Like being super duper dignified?
m_mainafter_27_01_22,"Do you really think that's what I'm getting at, you dolt?"
m_mainafter_27_01_23,"This is Dorothy we're talking about, so it should be fine."
m_mainafter_27_01_24,"For now, at least."
m_mainafter_27_01_25,I think so too.
m_mainafter_27_01_26,What makes you so sure?
m_mainafter_27_01_27,Because she might need some time to calm her emotions
m_mainafter_27_01_28,and...
m_mainafter_27_01_29,I don't think she'll be overly aggressive.
m_mainafter_27_01_30,Me neither.
m_mainafter_27_01_31,"I don't know what her intentions are, but she'll almost certainly be proceeding with caution."
m_mainafter_27_01_32,Her plan may well take more time than we expect it to.
m_mainafter_27_01_33,"I dunno, but this whole thing seems like your typical action movie plot, ya know?"
m_mainafter_27_01_34,"The heroes underestimate the villain, and before you know it, things blow up in their faces."
m_mainafter_27_01_35,"If it comes to that, we'll be able to stop her."
m_mainafter_27_01_36,"After all, she's not completely unreasonable."
m_mainafter_27_01_37,Hmm...
m_mainafter_27_01_38,Can I ask you two something?
m_mainafter_27_01_39,Is there something
m_mainafter_27_01_40,you guys are keeping from us?
m_mainafter_27_01_41,No.
m_mainafter_27_01_42,"So, why are you guys so perfectly in sync, huh?"
m_mainafter_27_01_43,That's just how I feel about the issue.
m_mainafter_27_01_44,Likewise.
m_mainafter_27_01_45,"Nah, there's definitely something going on between you two."
m_mainafter_27_01_46,Isn't it the telepathy that develops when you've been hanging out for ages?
m_mainafter_27_01_47,"I've been around just as long, and I ain't got no telepathic powers!"
m_mainafter_27_02_1,"While Elegg and Hammering are off investigating,"
m_mainafter_27_02_2,let's take this time to have a quick chat!
m_mainafter_27_02_3,You want to slack off while everyone else is working?
m_mainafter_27_02_4,"If it's bothering you that much, why don't you go help the others?"
m_mainafter_27_02_5,"Ugh, I've caught an illness that makes you not want to work!"
m_mainafter_27_02_6,Rapi.
m_mainafter_27_02_7,Yes?
m_mainafter_27_02_8,What do you think happened to Indivilia and Chatterbox?
m_mainafter_27_02_9,Not sure.
m_mainafter_27_02_10,"Even if they're capable of self-recovery, they're gonna need a good chunk of time to recuperate."
m_mainafter_27_02_11,"Whoa, didn't you destroy them?"
m_mainafter_27_02_12,"Almost, but not completely."
m_mainafter_27_02_13,"Unfortunately, I didn't finish the job."
m_mainafter_27_02_14,"You kicked some serious butt back there, that's for sure!"
m_mainafter_27_02_15,"It must be a real bummer though,"
m_mainafter_27_02_16,since you can't power up or anything anymore.
m_mainafter_27_02_17,I'd be lying if I said I'm not disappointed by what happened
m_mainafter_27_02_18,in numerous ways.
m_mainafter_27_02_19,"Not just the loss of strength, but parting ways stings even more."
m_mainafter_27_02_20,But this ability is dangerous and risky.
m_mainafter_27_02_21,How did you meet with Red Hood?
m_mainafter_27_02_22,It's a long story.
m_mainafter_27_02_23,I'll tell you when I have time.
m_mainafter_27_02_24,"I'd like you to hear that story as well, Commander."
m_mainafter_27_02_25,I'll be there.
m_mainafter_27_02_26,We've been told there are some unknown remnants left in your core.
m_mainafter_27_02_27,Is everything okay?
m_mainafter_27_02_28,It's not a problem.
m_mainafter_27_02_29,If I were to guess...
m_mainafter_27_02_30,I'd say it's probably the last vestiges of Red Hood.
m_mainafter_27_02_31,Perhaps it's my attachment that's holding onto her.
m_mainafter_27_02_32,"Dang, you're still as cool as ever. Heck, cooler, even!"
m_mainafter_27_02_33,You haven't seen anything yet.
m_mainafter_27_02_34,Oooh! Exciting!
m_mainafter_27_02_35,"Rapi, bragging? I never thought I'd see the day!"
m_mainafter_27_02_36,Looks like they need some help over there.
m_mainafter_27_02_37,"Let's go give them a hand, shall we?"
m_mainafter_27_02_38,All right.
m_mainafter_27_02_39,Roger.
m_mainafter_27_03_1,"Elegg was saying someone deliberately released this thing, right?"
m_mainafter_27_03_2,Fingers crossed that it isn't a Heretic.
m_mainafter_27_03_3,I believe there's a high chance that it is.
m_mainafter_27_03_4,I think so too.
m_mainafter_27_03_5,"Yeah... I figured as much,"
m_mainafter_27_03_6,"but who, tho?"
m_mainafter_27_03_7,Nihilister has seen better days.
m_mainafter_27_03_8,Liberalio's probably wandering somewhere near Eden.
m_mainafter_27_03_9,Indivilia got absolutely wrecked.
m_mainafter_27_03_10,Who else is left?
m_mainafter_27_03_11,Could it be a different heretic altogether?
m_mainafter_27_03_12,We can't say for sure that what we've encountered so far is all there is.
m_mainafter_27_03_13,"Sure, we've seen some near the Ark,"
m_mainafter_27_03_14,but that doesn't necessarily mean we've encountered them all.
m_mainafter_27_03_15,"Okay,"
m_mainafter_27_03_16,but break it down for me.
m_mainafter_27_03_17,Are we talking a few more stragglers or even a hundred-strong army?
m_mainafter_27_03_18,Either is possible.
m_mainafter_27_03_19,Great. Fantastic.
m_mainafter_27_03_20,??
m_mainafter_27_03_21,I don't get why you're so worked up.
m_mainafter_27_03_22,"I mean, we practically eat Heretics for breakfast, haha!"
m_mainafter_27_03_23,...
m_mainafter_27_03_24,You always have been rather... optimistic about this stuff.
m_mainafter_27_03_25,That's one of my positive traits!
m_mainafter_27_03_26,Rapi.
m_mainafter_27_03_27,Yes?
m_mainafter_27_03_28,Are there any Heretic sightings apart from the ones we just mentioned?
m_mainafter_27_03_29,"No, none."
m_mainafter_27_03_30,"Considering how vast the Surface is,"
m_mainafter_27_03_31,it wouldn't be surprising if there's something out there that has simply gone undetected.
m_mainafter_27_03_32,"Actually, I started to feel a little scared myself."
m_mainafter_27_03_33,"It doesn't matter. No matter how many there are, we'll defeat them."
m_mainafter_27_03_34,"There you go, guys!"
m_mainafter_27_03_35,Being scared is a perfectly reasonable reaction.
m_mainafter_27_03_36,Exactly!
m_mainafter_27_03_37,Of course.
m_mainafter_27_03_38,"Hey, hold up!"
m_mainafter_27_03_39,What if we do a 180 on this theory?
m_mainafter_27_03_40,Could that mean we're gonna stumble upon some Pilgrims too?
m_mainafter_27_03_41,That's possible.
m_mainafter_27_03_42,"Okay,"
m_mainafter_27_03_43,that makes me feel better.
m_mainafter_28_01_1,"Commander,"
m_mainafter_28_01_2,I just emailed you the stuff you asked for.
m_mainafter_28_01_3,"There might be loads of unfamiliar jargon,"
m_mainafter_28_01_4,so I suggest taking your time to go through it carefully.
m_mainafter_28_01_5,That was fast. Thank you.
m_mainafter_28_01_6,"Well, color me surprised!"
m_mainafter_28_01_7,I didn't think that you'd be into politics.
m_mainafter_28_01_8,That's not quite what I'm doing.
m_mainafter_28_01_9,True that.
m_mainafter_28_01_10,You'd much rather soar in ranks within Ark through your achievements alone.
m_mainafter_28_01_11,But it might be a good idea to check out the stuff I sent you.
m_mainafter_28_01_12,"After all, we wouldn't want you getting tricked, right?"
m_mainafter_28_01_13,There once was a commander who rose through the ranks in the same way you hope to.
m_mainafter_28_01_14,"I never met him personally,"
m_mainafter_28_01_15,but apparently he was a remarkable individual.
m_mainafter_28_01_16,"However, he fell so tragically and disappointingly."
m_mainafter_28_01_17,He was clueless about how politics worked.
m_mainafter_28_01_18,"He couldn't quite catch onto all the hidden meanings in what people said,"
m_mainafter_28_01_19,"or figure out why certain talks were more than meets the eye,"
m_mainafter_28_01_20,and it eventually led to his downfall.
m_mainafter_28_01_21,Is there...
m_mainafter_28_01_22,Hmm?
m_mainafter_28_01_23,Is there any chance you could tell me who he was?
m_mainafter_28_01_24,Huh? Why?
m_mainafter_28_01_25,Because I think I may know who you're referring to.
m_mainafter_28_01_26,It's probably who you're thinking of.
m_mainafter_28_01_27,"Good luck, and may you not suffer the same fate as him, Commander."
m_mainafter_28_01_28,"Got it, thanks."
m_mainafter_28_01_29,You always have my support.
m_ex_boomsday_01_1,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_boomsday_01_2,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_boomsday_01_3,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_boomsday_01_4,Mr. Commaaanderrr
m_ex_boomsday_01_5,Mr. Commmmaaaaanderrrrr
m_ex_boomsday_01_6,What?
m_ex_boomsday_01_7,Where are you?
m_ex_boomsday_01_8,You're not in your room.
m_ex_boomsday_01_9,I'm out right now.
m_ex_boomsday_01_10,You are?
m_ex_boomsday_01_11,Hm...
m_ex_boomsday_01_12,Hmm...
m_ex_boomsday_01_13,Hhhmmmm...
m_ex_boomsday_01_14,"All right, I'll wait for you in your room, then."
m_ex_boomsday_01_15,There's nobody inside right now.
m_ex_boomsday_01_16,I know.
m_ex_boomsday_01_17,I'll be back in a sec. Hang tight!
m_ex_boomsday_01_18,I'm in.
m_ex_boomsday_01_19,???
m_ex_boomsday_01_20,Take your time.
m_ex_boomsday_01_21,I'm gonna play some BOOM while I wait.
m_ex_boomsday_01_22,Hehe.
m_ex_boomsday_01_23,Elegg?
m_ex_boomsday_01_24,"She hasn't read my message, so I should head back as soon as I can."
m_ex_boomsday_02_1,Elegg has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_boomsday_02_2,Elegg has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_boomsday_02_3,Elegg has invited Exia to join the group.
m_ex_boomsday_02_4,What's all this?
m_ex_boomsday_02_5,I created this group chat for Trony.
m_ex_boomsday_02_6,Let's Photosynthesize?
m_ex_boomsday_02_7,Tony and I have agreed to
m_ex_boomsday_02_8,go out and bask in the sunshine once a week.
m_ex_boomsday_02_9,Huh?
m_ex_boomsday_02_10,And why did you invite me?
m_ex_boomsday_02_11,Cus...
m_ex_boomsday_02_12,Ta-da! This is it!
m_ex_boomsday_02_13,http://arkgameshow.com/
m_ex_boomsday_02_14,Because of the Ark Gaming Expo.
m_ex_boomsday_02_15,Need I remind you
m_ex_boomsday_02_16,all of my ultimate goal?
m_ex_boomsday_02_17,To play BOOM at the Ark Gaming Expo with Trony?
m_ex_boomsday_02_18,Exaactly!
m_ex_boomsday_02_19,Er...
m_ex_boomsday_02_20,"Well, it's happening tomorrow."
m_ex_boomsday_02_21,We're celebrating the fact that we've solved so many problems.
m_ex_boomsday_02_22,"Yup,"
m_ex_boomsday_02_23,count me in.
m_ex_boomsday_02_24,So...
m_ex_boomsday_02_25,We're gonna hit up the Retro Game Week display first.
m_ex_boomsday_02_26,I've gotta get my hands on the limited-edition BOOM package.
m_ex_boomsday_02_27,BOOM!
m_ex_boomsday_02_28,BOOM!
m_ex_boomsday_02_29,BOOM!
m_ex_boomsday_02_30,BOOM!
m_ex_boomsday_02_31,Quit spamming the chat.
m_ex_boomsday_02_32,"You'll have plenty of time, so do whatever you want."
m_ex_boomsday_02_33,I didn't say I was going...
m_ex_boomsday_02_34,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_boomsday_02_35,"You might be able to check out the Ark Ranger meet and greet,"
m_ex_boomsday_02_36,Trony.
m_ex_boomsday_02_37,Don't forget about Final Quest!
m_ex_boomsday_02_38,We're gonna have a whole lot more stuff to do at this expo than I thought.
m_ex_boomsday_02_39,"As long as we get there when it opens, we can do it all."
m_ex_boomsday_02_40,Let's meet at the entrance tomorrow.
m_ex_boomsday_02_41,Gotcha!
m_ex_boomsday_02_42,See you there.
m_ex_boomsday_02_43,Okay.
m_ex_boomsday_02_44,All right.
m_ex_boomsday_02_45,T_T
m_ex_boomsday_03_1,How's everybody today?
m_ex_boomsday_03_2,I'm loving this special Final Quest costume.
m_ex_boomsday_03_3,"It's perfect, hehe!"
m_ex_boomsday_03_4,I still can't believe you took down all those challengers.
m_ex_boomsday_03_5,That's because I'm invincible!
m_ex_boomsday_03_6,"I didn't even need your help, Noob."
m_ex_boomsday_03_7,That's true...
m_ex_boomsday_03_8,I even question
m_ex_boomsday_03_9,if all my opponents are beginners.
m_ex_boomsday_03_10,...
m_ex_boomsday_03_11,Seems like you've had loads of fun.
m_ex_boomsday_03_12,"What about you, Elegg?"
m_ex_boomsday_03_13,It's been a great day for killing demons.
m_ex_boomsday_03_14,Excuse me?
m_ex_boomsday_03_15,You don't get that reference?
m_ex_boomsday_03_16,It's a classic BOOM Guy line.
m_ex_boomsday_03_17,That's it!
m_ex_boomsday_03_18,"I'm gonna send you a BOOM Guy comic,"
m_ex_boomsday_03_19,so read it before our next chat.
m_ex_boomsday_03_20,...
m_ex_boomsday_03_21,"Anyway,"
m_ex_boomsday_03_22,Big shoutout to Exia for telling me about this expo!
m_ex_boomsday_03_23,I even got to see the limited-edition BOOM package!
m_ex_boomsday_03_24,I'm so happy!
m_ex_boomsday_03_25,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_boomsday_03_26,"Be sure to send me the photos you took, Mr. Commander."
m_ex_boomsday_03_27,The ones of you in front of the BOOM package?
m_ex_boomsday_03_28,Yeah!
m_ex_boomsday_03_29,I'll send them to you later.
m_ex_boomsday_03_30,Thanks.
m_ex_boomsday_03_31,I...
m_ex_boomsday_03_32,"For a little while, no messages came through."
m_ex_boomsday_03_33,"Thanks for the experience, everyone."
m_ex_boomsday_03_34,Hehehe.
m_ex_boomsday_03_35,"Did you enjoy yourself, Trony?"
m_ex_boomsday_03_36,"Yes, more than expected."
m_ex_boomsday_03_37,Your face was as red as a tomato
m_ex_boomsday_03_38,when you walked up to the Black Ark Ranger.
m_ex_boomsday_03_39,Trony left the group chat.
m_ex_boomsday_03_40,??
m_ex_boomsday_03_41,Elegg has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_boomsday_03_42,"Sorry about that, Trony..."
m_ex_boomsday_03_43,"Ah, I nearly forgot!"
m_ex_boomsday_03_44,Noob told me that
m_ex_boomsday_03_45,you guys solved the blackout issue.
m_ex_boomsday_03_46,"Thanks to you both, our Final Quest event went smoothly."
m_ex_boomsday_03_47,Appreciate it!
m_ex_boomsday_03_48,Well...
m_ex_boomsday_03_49,"For a little while, no messages came through."
m_ex_boomsday_03_50,No problem.
m_ex_boomsday_03_51,Hehe.
m_ex_boomsday_03_52,We should go soak up some rays outside sometime.
m_ex_boomsday_03_53,I...
m_ex_boomsday_03_54,I'll think about it.
m_ex_boomsday_04_1,No. 7!
m_ex_boomsday_04_2,I heard all about it!
m_ex_boomsday_04_3,What did you hear about?
m_ex_boomsday_04_4,Stories of you and Elegg solved all kinds of problems :)
m_ex_boomsday_04_5,"So, thanks!"
m_ex_boomsday_04_6,I'm glad it worked out well.
m_ex_boomsday_04_7,"Yeah, it's a relief."
m_ex_boomsday_04_8,I just wanted to thank you.
m_ex_boomsday_04_9,"That's unexpected, coming from you."
m_ex_boomsday_04_10,What do you mean?
m_ex_boomsday_04_11,"Thanks to you, all my troubles have been taken care of now :)"
m_ex_boomsday_04_12,You mean the power supply issues?
m_ex_boomsday_04_13,"That too, yeah."
m_ex_boomsday_04_14,??
m_ex_boomsday_04_15,I'm gonna get some rest.
m_ex_boomsday_04_16,I'll talk to you later.
m_ex_ade_01_1,"Hello, Master :)"
m_ex_ade_01_2,I'm Ade.
m_ex_ade_01_3,I'm from Maid For You.
m_ex_ade_01_4,I am employed at the Maid Cafe alongside Cocoa and Soda.
m_ex_ade_01_5,"Should you find yourself in need of cleaning, laundry, or cooking services,"
m_ex_ade_01_6,be sure to summon me at your most convenient hour.
m_ex_ade_01_7,I will attend to your every requirement promptly.
m_ex_ade_01_8,"To be honest,"
m_ex_ade_01_9,it truly is an exquisite honor to be able to speak with you! :)
m_ex_ade_01_10,That's very flattering to hear.
m_ex_ade_01_11,I'm sure you'll make your friends and family proud.
m_ex_ade_01_12,I mean it.
m_ex_ade_01_13,I've been wanting to contact you like this
m_ex_ade_01_14,for quite some time.
m_ex_ade_01_15,"Yes, indeed."
m_ex_ade_01_16,"I will never forget this moment,"
m_ex_ade_01_17,and I shall make sure to back up these messages...
m_ex_ade_01_18,"In actual fact,"
m_ex_ade_01_19,it appears that our paths shall cross soon.
m_ex_ade_01_20,We will?
m_ex_ade_01_21,We have an appointment for advising in half an hour.
m_ex_ade_01_22,"Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry."
m_ex_ade_01_23,No worries.
m_ex_ade_01_24,"As you are a busy individual, it is understandable that it may slip your mind."
m_ex_ade_01_25,I've prepared
m_ex_ade_01_26,some light refreshments for you.
m_ex_ade_01_27,Earl Grey tea and citrus scones.
m_ex_ade_01_28,Bacon quiche and salmon canapés.
m_ex_ade_01_29,Egg sandwiches and sachertorte.
m_ex_ade_01_30,You consider those light refreshments?
m_ex_ade_01_31,That's correct.
m_ex_ade_01_32,I can make more
m_ex_ade_01_33,if you'd like.
m_ex_ade_01_34,Is there anything else you'd like to try?
m_ex_ade_01_35,"No, that's okay."
m_ex_ade_01_36,"Very well, then. I shall bring them right over."
m_ex_ade_01_37,Don't worry about cleaning up your room in advance.
m_ex_ade_01_38,You can leave that to me.
m_ex_ade_01_39,"Until we meet again, Master."
m_ex_ade_01_40,See you.
m_ex_ade_01_41,... I really should tidy up a little before she gets here.
m_ex_ade_02_1,"Hello, Master :)"
m_ex_ade_02_2,I'm Ade.
m_ex_ade_02_3,May I be of service to you on this fine day?
m_ex_ade_02_4,"In fact, there is something you can help me with."
m_ex_ade_02_5,"Please proceed, Master."
m_ex_ade_02_6,You always speak so formally. It feels like I'm talking to an A.I.
m_ex_ade_02_7,"Oh, my gracious! Is that truly the case, Master?"
m_ex_ade_02_8,Do you find my manner of speaking akin to that of robot?
m_ex_ade_02_9,You're still doing it.
m_ex_ade_02_10,My apologies.
m_ex_ade_02_11,I shall endeavor to change the manner of speaking.
m_ex_ade_02_12,Hmm...
m_ex_ade_02_13,How should I tailor my speech to your preferences?
m_ex_ade_02_14,In an adorable and lively tone.
m_ex_ade_02_15,In a mature tone.
m_ex_ade_02_16,I see...
m_ex_ade_02_17,That's precisely Soda's manner of speech.
m_ex_ade_02_18,I think I can do that!
m_ex_ade_02_19,I'm not quite sure I can identify with that...
m_ex_ade_02_20,It seems to pose a certain challenge.
m_ex_ade_02_21,"How about something more lively, like Soda?"
m_ex_ade_02_22,I believe I can manage that.
m_ex_ade_02_23,Like this? ^0^
m_ex_ade_02_24,I had no inkling that you were into this sort of thing! ;)
m_ex_ade_02_25,"If that's your preference, I shall speak in this manner henceforth!"
m_ex_ade_02_26,"Master, Master! >.<"
m_ex_ade_02_27,Thanks for texting me! ♡
m_ex_ade_02_28,I've been thinking about you every day :3
m_ex_ade_02_29,"Gosh, I just blurted it out ♡ Hehehehe!"
m_ex_ade_02_30,I really put my foot in it this time :/
m_ex_ade_02_31,It feels like Soda is texting on Ade's phone.
m_ex_ade_02_32,"Is that actually you, Ade?"
m_ex_ade_02_33,"Of course, it's me ^___^♡"
m_ex_ade_02_34,"Sorry, but I take back what I said."
m_ex_ade_02_35,Huh? What do you mean? O.O
m_ex_ade_02_36,I think I prefer the way you usually speak.
m_ex_ade_02_37,OMG :0
m_ex_ade_02_38,Can you switch back?
m_ex_ade_02_39,"As you wish, Master."
m_ex_ade_02_40,"That was most interesting, indeed :)"
m_ex_ade_02_41,I can employ different eloquent expressions
m_ex_ade_02_42,from time to time and surprise you.
m_ex_ade_02_43,I can't shake the feeling that I have shot myself in the foot.
m_ex_ade_03_1,"You look exhausted, Master."
m_ex_ade_03_2,Have you been able to take sufficient rest lately? :(
m_ex_ade_03_3,"I haven't, but it's okay."
m_ex_ade_03_4,I'm concerned about you.
m_ex_ade_03_5,"I wish I could be as full of life as you, Ade."
m_ex_ade_03_6,Hmm?
m_ex_ade_03_7,How so?
m_ex_ade_03_8,You never seem to get tired.
m_ex_ade_03_9,"Ah, I see."
m_ex_ade_03_10,"Undoubtedly, there are moments when weariness sets in."
m_ex_ade_03_11,"Nevertheless, I am a maid."
m_ex_ade_03_12,"My sole purpose is to offer you an exquisite service,"
m_ex_ade_03_13,so it's imperative that I refrain from showing any trace of weariness in your presence.
m_ex_ade_03_14,Don't worry about me.
m_ex_ade_03_15,I always find ways to get ample rest.
m_ex_ade_03_16,I do my utmost not to stretch myself too thin.
m_ex_ade_03_17,"Awesome, I could definitely learn a thing or two from you."
m_ex_ade_03_18,I appreciate you saying that.
m_ex_ade_03_19,Your compliments never fail to uplift my spirits.
m_ex_ade_03_20,They serve as a constant source of motivation
m_ex_ade_03_21,and affirm my belief that I can get through any challenges :)
m_ex_ade_03_22,"I'll have to praise you even more in the future, then."
m_ex_ade_03_23,I am truly grateful
m_ex_ade_03_24,and eagerly look forward to it.
m_ex_ade_03_25,"As your maid, I shall consistently endeavor to bring you joy and satisfaction."
m_ex_ade_03_26,"So, Master..."
m_ex_ade_03_27,Yes?
m_ex_ade_03_28,May I kindly resume our previous conversation?
m_ex_ade_03_29,"Your well-being is of great importance to me,"
m_ex_ade_03_30,so I've acquired some tea
m_ex_ade_03_31,that can alleviate fatigue.
m_ex_ade_03_32,For me?
m_ex_ade_03_33,"Indeed,"
m_ex_ade_03_34,just for you.
m_ex_ade_03_35,May I inquire if you are currently in your room?
m_ex_ade_03_36,"If it pleases you, I can come by with the tea leaves."
m_ex_ade_03_37,"Of course, you can."
m_ex_ade_03_38,"Thank you, Master."
m_ex_ade_03_39,I will be there shortly :)
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_1,Command...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_2,Er...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_3,Master.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_4,... Hello? Master?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_5,Yes?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_6,There you are!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_7,You changed your profile picture to a kitten.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_8,Yep!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_9,"I mean... No, I didn't."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_10,?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_11,What are you talking about?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_12,You should zoom in and take a closer look.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_13,Those are 100% cat ears.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_14,Well...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_15,That's right.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_16,"I won't deny that,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_17,but have you checked out the face?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_18,It's a cat blushing because it's shy?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_19,What the...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_20,No!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_21,It's got nothing to do with being shy.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_22,It's anger!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_23,"I'm trying to tell you that it's me in the photo,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_24,not a cat!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_25,Take a closer look!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_26,I took a very close look.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_27,Well?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_28,"Now, can you recognize me?"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_29,You're so adorable!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_30,Darn right!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_31,"Wait,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_32,hold on...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_33,You really think so?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_34,"If you don't want me to say it, then I take it back."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_35,That's not what I meant!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_36,Don't be ridiculous!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_37,You can say whatever you want!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_38,"You're positively, absolutely, totally adorbs!"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_39,...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_40,Good grief...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_41,"Anyway, what's up?"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_42,That's what I've been trying to get to!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_43,Hmph!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_44,"I'll be at the Maid Cafe for a while,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_45,so feel free to drop by whenever you want.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_46,"Anyway, I was just kinda throwing it out there."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_47,No need to feel obliged to show up or anything.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_01_48,"Well, I've gotta get back to work. See ya!"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_1,Command...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_2,"Dang it, almost said it again."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_3,Master.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_4,I want to ask you something.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_5,What is it?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_6,Why's the Maid Cafe so popular?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_7,It's just a bunch of women dolled up as maids
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_8,"who address their customers as ""Master"","
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_9,"recite bizarre spells when serving food,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_10,"doodle with ketchup,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_11,"and of course, entertain with their singing and dancing."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_12,"Always sporting a smile, of course."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_13,Isn't that all?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_14,What's so special about that?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_15,I just don't get why it's so popular.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_16,You just mentioned all the reasons why.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_17,Huh?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_18,I did?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_19,You mean...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_20,All that stuff I just rattled off
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_21,is what people find so appealing about this place?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_22,"Yeah, that's right."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_23,"Now, I'm even more confused."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_24,"I just went through what I said earlier,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_25,and it's still eluding me.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_26,You have to respect other people's preferences.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_27,You'll understand someday.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_28,I do!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_29,"I just don't get it, that's all."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_30,I will?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_31,"No, I don't want to understand."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_32,Humph.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_33,"To be honest,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_34,"I thought you'd give me a clearcut answer,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_35,but then it turns out
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_36,I had the answers all along.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_37,Hmm...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_38,"How about you, Master? Do you like the Maid Cafe?"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_39,I like it very much.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_40,You've gotta be kidding me.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_41,Why?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_42,Is it because you like maid outfits?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_43,Or are you partial to their singing and dancing?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_44,Or is it...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_45,It's because you work there.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_46,...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_47,GAH!#R!#T
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_48,OHMY GODAsrQWR!#R
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_49,"Sorry, typos."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_50,"Anyway,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_51,"if that's the reason,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_52,I suppose I can understand now.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_53,"I suppose if you really like this place so much, you could consider coming to visit later."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_54,I... er...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_02_55,I could make you a cup of tea or something.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_1,Become tastier... Become tastier...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_2,"Coochie woochie,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_3,boing!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_4,What are you doing?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_5,I'm practicing the spell.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_6,"I can type it all out just fine,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_7,"but the moment I try to recite it in real life, everything just falls apart."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_8,Could it be because you're too shy?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_9,Maybe you just haven't gotten the hang of it.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_10,What are you talking about?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_11,I just have a hard time
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_12,saying something so childish out loud!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_13,It's got nothing to do
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_14,with me being shy.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_15,Huh?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_16,It's got nothing to do with that!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_17,I just don't care about it enough to practice!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_18,"Then, you've got to say it like you mean it."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_19,What do you mean?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_20,How do I do that?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_21,Just put your heart and soul into it when you're reciting it.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_22,Eh?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_23,Why should I do that?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_24,Don't you want the person you care about to enjoy their food as much as possible?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_25,...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_26,"Yes, but..."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_27,Hmm...
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_28,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_29,"When are you going to visit, Master?"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_30,Me? Why?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_31,I'm offering you a unique opportunity
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_32,to help me practice.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_33,Am I your training buddy now?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_34,Naturally.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_35,Who else would it be?
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_36,"Listen up, okay?"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_37,"Just so you know,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_38,don't get any funny ideas about all this!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_39,I'm not intending to hit on you or anything!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_40,"All right, then. I guess I just won't go."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_41,!!!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_42,Seriously?!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_43,"Okay,"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_44,okay.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_45,Fine.
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_46,I take back what I said!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_47,"Now, you take back what you said!"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_48,"Too late, you've upset me."
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_49,"C'mon, don't be such a baby!"
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_50,You're fine!
m_ex_privaty_unkindmaid_03_51,"Get your butt over to the Maid Cafe, pronto!"
m_ex_elegg_01_1,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_elegg_01_2,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_elegg_01_3,Mr. Commaaanderrrrrr!
m_ex_elegg_01_4,BOOM!
m_ex_elegg_01_5,BOOM! BOOM!
m_ex_elegg_01_6,BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
m_ex_elegg_01_7,You scared me there for a sec!
m_ex_elegg_01_8,"Hehe! Heya, Mr. Commander!"
m_ex_elegg_01_9,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_elegg_01_10,I'm Elegg.
m_ex_elegg_01_11,I'm from the Electric Shock Squad.
m_ex_elegg_01_12,I remember.
m_ex_elegg_01_13,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_elegg_01_14,You do?
m_ex_elegg_01_15,"I know that you work with a whole bunch of different Nikkes,"
m_ex_elegg_01_16,so I thought I'd remind you just in case you might forget :3
m_ex_elegg_01_17,"You forgot, didn't you?"
m_ex_elegg_01_18,"Well, I guess that makes sense,"
m_ex_elegg_01_19,considering how many Nikkes you work with.
m_ex_elegg_01_20,"Just thought I'd drop a reminder in case it slipped your mind, hehe."
m_ex_elegg_01_21,You contacted me just to tell me that?
m_ex_elegg_01_22,"Nope, that's not even close!"
m_ex_elegg_01_23,"I re-read some old BOOM comics today, and I've gotta say,"
m_ex_elegg_01_24,BOOM Guy is such a hottie!
m_ex_elegg_01_25,"No one around me is familiar with that game though,"
m_ex_elegg_01_26,I wanted to share it with you!
m_ex_elegg_01_27,I didn't know there was a BOOM comic series.
m_ex_elegg_01_28,There certainly is!
m_ex_elegg_01_29,It's all about BOOM Guy wielding a massive arsenal to defeat his enemies.
m_ex_elegg_01_30,"The books may be short, but they're packed with exciting scenes!"
m_ex_elegg_01_31,They're so immersive too!
m_ex_elegg_01_32,It's honestly hard to describe in words.
m_ex_elegg_01_33,"Where are you now, Mr. Commander?"
m_ex_elegg_01_34,I'm in my room.
m_ex_elegg_01_35,"Sweet, I'll come over right now!"
m_ex_elegg_01_36,I can tell you all about the BOOM comics!
m_ex_elegg_01_37,You've really gotta check them out!
m_ex_elegg_01_38,"Trust me, you'll be totally hooked!"
m_ex_elegg_01_39,"Hang on, I'll be there in a jiffy!"
m_ex_elegg_01_40,"Before I can turn Elegg down, she has already stopped reading messages."
m_ex_elegg_02_1,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_elegg_02_2,Mr. Coommaanndeerr!
m_ex_elegg_02_3,Yes?
m_ex_elegg_02_4,"Are you good at sorting things, Mr. Commander?"
m_ex_elegg_02_5,"Yes, I'm great at it."
m_ex_elegg_02_6,"No, not really."
m_ex_elegg_02_7,"Oh, that's a surprise!"
m_ex_elegg_02_8,How so?
m_ex_elegg_02_9,I seem to recall your room always being a mess.
m_ex_elegg_02_10,Unless that's just how you organize things?
m_ex_elegg_02_11,Same here!
m_ex_elegg_02_12,Hehehe.
m_ex_elegg_02_13,Why do you ask?
m_ex_elegg_02_14,"Oh, um..."
m_ex_elegg_02_15,I just came back from an inspection at the Power Station.
m_ex_elegg_02_16,That place never ceases to amaze me.
m_ex_elegg_02_17,All the wires
m_ex_elegg_02_18,are sorted so nicely!
m_ex_elegg_02_19,They're even divided up according to category!
m_ex_elegg_02_20,Isn't that amazing?
m_ex_elegg_02_21,... Is it?
m_ex_elegg_02_22,"Of course, it is!"
m_ex_elegg_02_23,You've been to our institute.
m_ex_elegg_02_24,"Over there,"
m_ex_elegg_02_25,wires are hanging from the ceiling like cobwebs.
m_ex_elegg_02_26,"They're also strewn about the floor,"
m_ex_elegg_02_27,"so they're always hanging on my arm,"
m_ex_elegg_02_28,or I end up kicking them with my feet.
m_ex_elegg_02_29,Why don't you sort them out?
m_ex_elegg_02_30,"I've tried to. Several times, in fact."
m_ex_elegg_02_31,"The weird thing is that after a day or two,"
m_ex_elegg_02_32,they go straight back to the way they were.
m_ex_elegg_02_33,"So, I figured"
m_ex_elegg_02_34,I could learn some tips and tricks on how to organize things from you.
m_ex_elegg_02_35,I guess I was wrong.
m_ex_elegg_02_36,Isn't Maxwell responsible for arranging the wiring at the Power Station?
m_ex_elegg_02_37,I think so?
m_ex_elegg_02_38,Oh!
m_ex_elegg_02_39,Right!
m_ex_elegg_02_40,"Oops, my bad, Mr. Commander!"
m_ex_elegg_02_41,I guess I should've gone straight to Maxwell instead!
m_ex_elegg_02_42,Hehehehehehe!
m_ex_elegg_02_43,I'll go talk to her now!
m_ex_elegg_02_44,"Thanks, Mr. Commander!"
m_ex_elegg_03_1,Wowee!
m_ex_elegg_03_2,"This is awesome, Mr. Commander!"
m_ex_elegg_03_3,"My vision has never been so clear,"
m_ex_elegg_03_4,"and my mind so shaaaarrrrrp,"
m_ex_elegg_03_5,and my body so flexible!
m_ex_elegg_03_6,I feel like I'm omnipotent!
m_ex_elegg_03_7,And all it took was one sip.
m_ex_elegg_03_8,FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!
m_ex_elegg_03_9,Have you been hitting the bottle?
m_ex_elegg_03_10,"It's not alcohol I've been drinking,"
m_ex_elegg_03_11,but an energy drink that Ether gave me.
m_ex_elegg_03_12,She asked
m_ex_elegg_03_13,if I wanted to try
m_ex_elegg_03_14,her homemade energy drink.
m_ex_elegg_03_15,She seemed awfully proud of it!
m_ex_elegg_03_16,"Trony seemed pretty pooped, so I gave her some,"
m_ex_elegg_03_17,and you should see her now.
m_ex_elegg_03_18,"She perks up instantly, and her eyes sparkling with energy!"
m_ex_elegg_03_19,It's like she became a different person!
m_ex_elegg_03_20,"At first, I thought Trony and Ether were messing with me."
m_ex_elegg_03_21,"After all,"
m_ex_elegg_03_22,don't you think it's weird for someone to get so jazzed up
m_ex_elegg_03_23,from just a sip of an energy drink?
m_ex_elegg_03_24,That is rather strange.
m_ex_elegg_03_25,"I know, right!"
m_ex_elegg_03_26,"So, I got super curious..."
m_ex_elegg_03_27,and I took a sip.
m_ex_elegg_03_28,Whoooaaaa! This is like seriously...
m_ex_elegg_03_29,BOOOOM!!!
m_ex_elegg_03_30,BOOM! BOOM!!
m_ex_elegg_03_31,That Ether is really something else!
m_ex_elegg_03_32,I've gotta ask her for more!
m_ex_elegg_03_33,Hehehehehehehe!
m_ex_elegg_03_34,"The only thing is,"
m_ex_elegg_03_35,"Now, I feel kinda..."
m_ex_elegg_03_36,I dunno...
m_ex_elegg_03_37,Dizzy?
m_ex_elegg_03_38,Aaaaemm
m_ex_elegg_03_39,EEEEEEH
m_ex_elegg_03_40,Elegg?
m_ex_elegg_03_41,I hear nothing back from Elegg.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_1,Cocoa has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_2,Cocoa has invited Soda to join the group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_3,Cocoa has invited Privaty to join the group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_4,Cocoa has invited Drake to join the group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_5,"All right,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_6,everyone's here.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_7,What's this group for?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_8,This is a group
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_9,for maids working for us temporarily.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_10,We can discuss all matters about the Valentine's Day event.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_11,"Wow,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_12,we even have to interact with a Bla group?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_13,"Let's disregard how odd it seems to use ""temporary"" and ""professional"" together."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_14,"But indeed,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_15,are we truly going to become maids?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_16,You don't like it?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_17,... Huh?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_18,You don't want to talk with us on Bla?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_19,It's not that.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_20,You don't want to chat with us?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_21,That makes me so sad!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_22,I just said that's not it.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_23,LOL
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_24,"You're pretty heartless, you know that?"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_25,"Yeah, totally heartless."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_26,LOL
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_27,"Wha... not you too, Commander!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_28,Commander! Don't tell me you're on their side.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_29,"You've got villain potential, I'll tell you that much."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_30,What are you talking about?!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_31,"If you're not interested in exploring it, then forget I said anything."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_32,Argh!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_33,I want to talk to all of you!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_34,I have a lot of fun being around you guys!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_35,That's great!
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_36,"I have fun, too."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_37,We can all share information
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_38,or ask any questions we want in this group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_39,Got it?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_40,... Fine.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_41,Hmm? You don't seem so enthusiastic.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_42,Not at all.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_43,"You don't wanna be in here, do you?"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_44,"She doesn't like it at all, LOL."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_45,Don't you like talking to us?
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_46,"I do like it, you idiots! I love it! More than anything!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_47,"Hehe, me too."
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_48,Same here.
m_ex_perfectmaid_01_49,That's great. LOL
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_1,Cocoa has invited Ade to join the group.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_2,Voila!
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_3,Say hello to Ade!
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_4,"Wow, I didn't realize there was a group chat."
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_5,"Hey, Ade!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_6,Welcome.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_7,Howdy.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_8,Welcome!
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_9,"Thanks, everyone."
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_10,I appreciate all the things you've been doing for us.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_11,It's nothing.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_12,Hmm?
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_13,I just noticed that
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_14,Drake and Privaty have changed their avatars.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_15,LOL
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_16,Yeah.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_17,That's because I'm a villainous maid now!
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_18,I...
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_19,"I didn't really want to change it,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_20,but everyone else was wearing a maid outfit in their avatar.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_21,So I just followed suit.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_22,"Well,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_23,"we appreciate the hard work you've put in,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_24,both of you.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_25,"Speak of which,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_26,I made some mistakes at work today.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_27,You did?
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_28,I thought you did a great job.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_29,I make mistakes all the time! Haha
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_30,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_31,Of course!
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_32,"Anyway, that's all in the past. Just let it go."
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_33,Exactly.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_34,Tomorrow is a new day that you can tackle head-on.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_35,"Behold, the villainous maid will reveal her true colors tomorrow!!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_36,Tomorrow won't be like today.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_37,I won't make any more stupid mistakes.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_38,Don't worry about that.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_39,Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_40,Well... just don't expect too much.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_41,Very good.
m_ex_perfectmaid_02_42,"Keep up the hard work, girls."
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_1,Mwahahahaha!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_2,Girls!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_3,"It's Valentine's Day,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_4,so you've got to work extra hard.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_5,"As for me, I'm heading back to being a full-time villain, mwahaha!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_6,"I went to bed early last night so I could be energized for the special occasion,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_7,"because today, my friends, is a cheat day!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_8,I'm gonna be doing what a villain does best:
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_9,slacking off and clocking out early!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_10,"You all owe me big time for helping out, by the way."
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_11,"Sooner or later, I'm gonna..."
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_12,"Goodbye, Drake :)"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_13,!!!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_14,You saw all that?!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_15,I thought I'd be able to rattle these messages off before anyone got off work.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_16,"Everyone else is busy while I'm resting,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_17,so I'm the only one who has time to see your messages.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_18,You really did a great job helping us out.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_19,"No,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_20,it's nothing.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_21,"However,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_22,you still owe me.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_23,"You're in my debt, and sooner or later, I'll come to collect."
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_24,"Until then, keep your nose to the grindstone!"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_25,Sounds good :)
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_26,I'll be expecting you.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_27,Take care!
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_28,"No, YOU take care."
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_29,Will do.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_30,Thanks again for all your hard work.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_31,Save your gratitude for when you pay off your debt.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_32,Poor you... you'll be a maid for the rest of your life.
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_33,"Haha,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_03_34,that's the greatest compliment anyone's ever given me!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_1,"Privaty, are you okay?"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_2,It's like a rain cloud has been following you since yesterday.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_3,Is something bothering you?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_4,Huh? Me?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_5,Are you not feeling well?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_6,"You're not sick, are you?"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_7,I'm not sick.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_8,I'm fine.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_9,Does this have anything to do with Yulha and Admi coming to see you?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_10,Huh?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_11,No!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_12,It's just...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_13,"Ugh, this is so embarrassing..."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_14,"I'm fine, honestly."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_15,Is there anything I can do?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_16,How about
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_17,I make a special Valentine's Day cake for you? :)
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_18,I'm not a child.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_19,You think eating sweets will cheer me up?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_20,"If you won't eat it, I will."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_21,!!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_22,You can't do that!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_23,She made that for me!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_24,How could you?!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_25,Because I love the cakes Ade makes.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_26,"I'm glad you like it, Master."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_27,Who says I don't want it?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_28,I love your cakes more than anything!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_29,You do? That's great :)
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_30,I...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_31,I mean...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_32,Argh!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_33,Would you like to share?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_34,Share what?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_35,The cake?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_36,That's right.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_37,You'd like to share your cake with me? Hehe.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_38,Sure.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_39,I'd love to
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_40,"Oops, typo."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_41,"Haha, steady now."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_42,I'm all right now!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_43,"Anyway,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_44,I'd love to share it.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_45,Nice!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_46,Since when was I volunteering to share?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_47,I was just trying to figure out what you meant.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_48,Unless you weren't talking to me... but who else would you have been talking to...?
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_49,"I was asking you, Privaty. Let's share the cake."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_50,...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_51,...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_52,...
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_53,"You know, you could have been a little clearer earlier."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_54,"All right then, I'll prepare a cake big enough for two."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_55,I'll whip up something as well.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_56,You two have been working hard.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_57,"Hehe,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_58,"I'll make something too,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_59,'cause you two are my best buds!
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_60,This is going to be quite the feast.
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_61,Although
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_62,"I'm not entirely sure why we're all getting so mushy,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_63,I suppose
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_64,"I'm looking forward to it, too."
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_65,"Just give us some time,"
m_ex_perfectmaid_04_66,and I'll have that cake ready for you soon :)
m_ex_admi_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_admi_04_2,there's something I want to tell you.
m_ex_admi_04_3,"What's wrong, Admi?"
m_ex_admi_04_4,Actually...
m_ex_admi_04_5,...
m_ex_admi_04_6,...
m_ex_admi_04_7,...
m_ex_admi_04_8,Admi?
m_ex_admi_04_9,I've been having a lot of nightmares lately.
m_ex_admi_04_10,What kind of nightmares?
m_ex_admi_04_11,Hmm...
m_ex_admi_04_12,The kind that startles me awake and not let me easily drift back into sleep.
m_ex_admi_04_13,"Then, I find myself pondering why I'm having these unsettling dreams,"
m_ex_admi_04_14,"and before I know it, morning has already arrived."
m_ex_admi_04_15,Sounds rough.
m_ex_admi_04_16,I feel anxious that something bad is going to happen.
m_ex_admi_04_17,Is there anything I can do about it?
m_ex_admi_04_18,Can you tell me what the dreams are about? I can help interpret them for you.
m_ex_admi_04_19,"Sure, but what good would that do?"
m_ex_admi_04_20,"By analyzing these nightmares, we can figure out what they mean."
m_ex_admi_04_21,Very well.
m_ex_admi_04_22,The scariest dream I've had recently
m_ex_admi_04_23,involved drowning.
m_ex_admi_04_24,The water was so deep
m_ex_admi_04_25,that I couldn't see the bottom.
m_ex_admi_04_26,It was absolutely frightening.
m_ex_admi_04_27,"I just looked it up, and water in dreams apparently symbolizes hope."
m_ex_admi_04_28,Hope?
m_ex_admi_04_29,"Yeah, and since you were drowning in really deep water, that means you'll succeed greatly."
m_ex_admi_04_30,Really?
m_ex_admi_04_31,I also dream a lot about a huge snake.
m_ex_admi_04_32,A snake symbolizes luck and vitality.
m_ex_admi_04_33,"Luck and vitality, huh?"
m_ex_admi_04_34,"Yeah, seems like you'll lead a long and successful life."
m_ex_admi_04_35,"Wow, I had no idea that's what it all meant."
m_ex_admi_04_36,"I initially found it rather unsettling, but realizing there's a positive meaning behind it all"
m_ex_admi_04_37,brings a comforting sense of clarity.
m_ex_admi_04_38,I bet!
m_ex_admi_04_39,"Actually, there's one more dream that I'm curious about."
m_ex_admi_04_40,Yeah? Tell me.
m_ex_admi_04_41,Well...
m_ex_admi_04_42,...
m_ex_admi_04_43,...
m_ex_admi_04_44,...
m_ex_admi_04_45,I dreamed of your back.
m_ex_admi_04_46,My back?
m_ex_admi_04_47,Yes.
m_ex_admi_04_48,"But regardless of how much I call out to you, you refuse to turn around."
m_ex_admi_04_49,Do you think that's also a good dream?
m_ex_admi_04_50,I'm worried that perhaps you're not entirely comfortable talking with me.
m_ex_admi_04_51,"Well, dreams and real life aren't always analogous."
m_ex_admi_04_52,Sorry?
m_ex_admi_04_53,Because I'm having a great time talking to you right now.
m_ex_admi_04_54,"Ah, is that so?"
m_ex_admi_04_55,"Nightmares can be little hints of good things to come, so relax and get some rest."
m_ex_admi_04_56,Okay!
m_ex_admi_04_57,"Thank you, Commander!"
m_ex_admi_05_1,Commander.
m_ex_admi_05_2,What's wrong?
m_ex_admi_05_3,I...
m_ex_admi_05_4,...
m_ex_admi_05_5,...
m_ex_admi_05_6,...
m_ex_admi_05_7,What is it?
m_ex_admi_05_8,It's a bit hard to say.
m_ex_admi_05_9,Does it have something to do with Privaty?
m_ex_admi_05_10,Does it have something to do with Yulha?
m_ex_admi_05_11,!!
m_ex_admi_05_12,How did you know?
m_ex_admi_05_13,No.
m_ex_admi_05_14,"Yulha did give me a scolding, but that was it."
m_ex_admi_05_15,"Then, it's got to be Privaty."
m_ex_admi_05_16,!!
m_ex_admi_05_17,Did you two have a fight?
m_ex_admi_05_18,"No, it's just..."
m_ex_admi_05_19,Er...
m_ex_admi_05_20,...
m_ex_admi_05_21,...
m_ex_admi_05_22,...
m_ex_admi_05_23,I saw something.
m_ex_admi_05_24,What did you see?
m_ex_admi_05_25,Privaty was carrying my bag
m_ex_admi_05_26,and admiring herself in the mirror with a contented expression.
m_ex_admi_05_27,Oh.
m_ex_admi_05_28,Yeah...
m_ex_admi_05_29,Maybe she just thought the bag looked nice and wanted to give it a try.
m_ex_admi_05_30,Maybe she wants to feel young again.
m_ex_admi_05_31,But what if it's not so simple?
m_ex_admi_05_32,I seem to have stumbled upon something I shouldn't have.
m_ex_admi_05_33,I'm not sure how I should face Privaty from now on.
m_ex_admi_05_34,"Sigh, I'm conflicted."
m_ex_admi_05_35,Just pretend you didn't see anything and act normally.
m_ex_admi_05_36,Just go ahead and ask her straight up.
m_ex_admi_05_37,"I'd love to, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it."
m_ex_admi_05_38,"Then, just act like you didn't see a thing."
m_ex_admi_05_39,"Yeah, that seems like the best option."
m_ex_admi_05_40,Let's keep all this between the two of us.
m_ex_admi_05_41,Okay!
m_ex_admi_05_42,"Thank you for listening, Commander."
m_ex_admi_06_1,"I have a question for you, Commander."
m_ex_admi_06_2,What's up?
m_ex_admi_06_3,What kind of cat do you like?
m_ex_admi_06_4,Cats that are black from head to toe.
m_ex_admi_06_5,Black cats with white paws.
m_ex_admi_06_6,"Black cats are the best, aren't they?"
m_ex_admi_06_7,So mystical and mysterious.
m_ex_admi_06_8,"Every time I look at them, they evoke a special feeling within me,"
m_ex_admi_06_9,they are truly adorable.
m_ex_admi_06_10,I love them too.
m_ex_admi_06_11,It looks like they're walking around with cute white socks on.
m_ex_admi_06_12,Who can possibly resist something that cute?
m_ex_admi_06_13,What about you? What's your favorite kind of cat?
m_ex_admi_06_14,...
m_ex_admi_06_15,...
m_ex_admi_06_16,...
m_ex_admi_06_17,That's a tough one.
m_ex_admi_06_18,"Whether it's a solid or tuxedo coat,"
m_ex_admi_06_19,both exude their own beauty and allure.
m_ex_admi_06_20,"Then, you have some with distinct patterns resembling mini apex predators,"
m_ex_admi_06_21,while others seem like fish that are ready to swim off at any moment.
m_ex_admi_06_22,I find them all so appealing.
m_ex_admi_06_23,"Don't forget, there are also ginger cats and calico cats..."
m_ex_admi_06_24,"In other words, you like all cats."
m_ex_admi_06_25,"It's tough to choose just one, isn't it?"
m_ex_admi_06_26,It is.
m_ex_admi_06_27,"Long-haired cats are really cool,"
m_ex_admi_06_28,but short-haired ones can also be really adorable.
m_ex_admi_06_29,Whenever I see them
m_ex_admi_06_30,"basking in the sun with eyes gently shut,"
m_ex_admi_06_31,I can practically feel myself loosening up and dozing off.
m_ex_admi_06_32,I know that feeling all too well.
m_ex_admi_06_33,It's hard to choose just one.
m_ex_admi_06_34,"I know, right? I can't do it either."
m_ex_admi_06_35,Talking with you about cats really makes my day.
m_ex_admi_06_36,I can feel my fatigue melting away!
m_ex_admi_06_37,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_admi_06_38,I'm glad to talk with you at any time.
m_ex_aria_04_1,"Hello, Maestro."
m_ex_aria_04_2,I have good news.
m_ex_aria_04_3,What is it?
m_ex_aria_04_4,I've finally received my role for our upcoming project.
m_ex_aria_04_5,Which genre is it? Are you taking up the lead role?
m_ex_aria_04_6,It's a modern opera with a uniquely refined interpretation.
m_ex_aria_04_7,"The role I'll be playing is a princess who is as beautiful as a radiant flower,"
m_ex_aria_04_8,yet her heart is as cold and ruthless as ice.
m_ex_aria_04_9,"Naturally, it will be the leading role."
m_ex_aria_04_10,This is just perfect for you!
m_ex_aria_04_11,A breathtakingly beautiful and aloof princess... just like you in every way.
m_ex_aria_04_12,"Thank you,"
m_ex_aria_04_13,I thought so as well.
m_ex_aria_04_14,Maestro.
m_ex_aria_04_15,I feel you have an erroneous perception of me.
m_ex_aria_04_16,"It's true that I am beautiful, but aloof? Hardly."
m_ex_aria_04_17,I simply meant that the role is perfect for you.
m_ex_aria_04_18,Really? Very well. I misunderstood.
m_ex_aria_04_19,What's it about?
m_ex_aria_04_20,"I want you to come and watch for yourself,"
m_ex_aria_04_21,"but the first performance is still a long way off,"
m_ex_aria_04_22,"so I can give you a little snippet, since I know you're eager to watch it."
m_ex_aria_04_23,Thanks!
m_ex_aria_04_24,"In the allure of the princess's beauty, countless men"
m_ex_aria_04_25,"come bearing precious treasures, each asking for her hand"
m_ex_aria_04_26,and pledging undying devotion.
m_ex_aria_04_27,"Yet, the princess looks down at these men"
m_ex_aria_04_28,and poses them a difficult riddle.
m_ex_aria_04_29,"Should they solve the riddle, she shall be theirs."
m_ex_aria_04_30,If they were to get it wrong...
m_ex_aria_04_31,What then?
m_ex_aria_04_32,They will be executed at once.
m_ex_aria_04_33,"Whoa, that's intense."
m_ex_aria_04_34,"The show delves into the idea of how badly you want something,"
m_ex_aria_04_35,and whether you'd be willing to risk your life for it.
m_ex_aria_04_36,Sounds intriguing.
m_ex_aria_04_37,"What about you, Maestro?"
m_ex_aria_04_38,Is there anything that you're willing to give your life for?
m_ex_aria_04_39,Reclaiming the surface stolen by the Raptures.
m_ex_aria_04_40,Ensuring everyone leads a peaceful life.
m_ex_aria_04_41,And you would truly be willing to trade your life for such a thing?
m_ex_aria_04_42,"Yes, even if I die trying."
m_ex_aria_04_43,I see.
m_ex_aria_04_44,I'm glad I consulted you before starting this new role.
m_ex_aria_04_45,You've been a big help. Thank you.
m_ex_aria_04_46,Glad that I could help.
m_ex_aria_04_47,Be sure to come watch the performance when it launches.
m_ex_aria_04_48,"Of course, I'll be there with flowers."
m_ex_aria_05_1,"Maestro, do you remember Tetra Net?"
m_ex_aria_05_2,I mentioned it before.
m_ex_aria_05_3,The one where the troupe suggested you host a channel?
m_ex_aria_05_4,"Yes, that's it."
m_ex_aria_05_5,"Well, it took some time, but I finally made it."
m_ex_aria_05_6,"Now, you can watch my performances any time you want."
m_ex_aria_05_7,That's awesome!
m_ex_aria_05_8,Do you know how to subscribe to the channels?
m_ex_aria_05_9,"I recently learned how to, so if you're not sure, I can teach you."
m_ex_aria_05_10,I've already subscribed.
m_ex_aria_05_11,"Oh my, already? I'm touched."
m_ex_aria_05_12,"I only just started, so how did you know?"
m_ex_aria_05_13,It popped up on the trending section.
m_ex_aria_05_14,Trending section?
m_ex_aria_05_15,What's that?
m_ex_aria_05_16,It's where popular videos are displayed.
m_ex_aria_05_17,"Wow, I see."
m_ex_aria_05_18,"I'm not entirely certain, but it's reassuring to see the channel taking off."
m_ex_aria_05_19,Creating this channel was a wise decision after all.
m_ex_aria_05_20,"So, thank you."
m_ex_aria_05_21,"Hey, it seems like something's on your mind. What's up?"
m_ex_aria_05_22,"Well, it's pertaining to managing the official channel."
m_ex_aria_05_23,What's wrong?
m_ex_aria_05_24,"The troupe leader suggests taking a video for the premiere,"
m_ex_aria_05_25,but I don't know what kind of concept I should go with.
m_ex_aria_05_26,It'd be nice if you can give me some ideas.
m_ex_aria_05_27,How about a Q&A session where you answer everything?
m_ex_aria_05_28,How about kicking off with a personal vlog?
m_ex_aria_05_29,Hmm...
m_ex_aria_05_30,"There might be some questions I'd rather not answer,"
m_ex_aria_05_31,since I like to keep some things private.
m_ex_aria_05_32,A vlog? What's that?
m_ex_aria_05_33,It's a video where you share your everyday life.
m_ex_aria_05_34,I'm a bit apprehensive about showing myself outside my performances.
m_ex_aria_05_35,"Honestly, so long as you're the focus, it'll be riveting no matter what."
m_ex_aria_05_36,Oh?
m_ex_aria_05_37,I think I understand what you're getting at.
m_ex_aria_05_38,"Thank you, Maestro."
m_ex_aria_05_39,I'll try to make a personal video for my fans.
m_ex_aria_05_40,I'll be sure to like it when you upload it.
m_ex_aria_06_1,"Maestro,"
m_ex_aria_06_2,is it true that karaoke is popular?
m_ex_aria_06_3,"Actually, it has always been popular."
m_ex_aria_06_4,Is it really that fun?
m_ex_aria_06_5,You're in a cramped room and have to share a microphone with everyone.
m_ex_aria_06_6,I've also heard that some people dance on the sofa.
m_ex_aria_06_7,Sounds like you already have a good picture of what it's like.
m_ex_aria_06_8,Noise and Volume filled me in.
m_ex_aria_06_9,Volume goes to one whenever she hasn't had enough even after a live concert.
m_ex_aria_06_10,"Sometimes, she even goes on her own."
m_ex_aria_06_11,It can be a lot of fun even when you're on your own.
m_ex_aria_06_12,Really?
m_ex_aria_06_13,I thought it was something you'd do with a big group of friends.
m_ex_aria_06_14,Not necessarily. Everyone has different ways of enjoying it.
m_ex_aria_06_15,That's true.
m_ex_aria_06_16,I heard there are different types of karaoke as well.
m_ex_aria_06_17,"If you know any, could you recommend me one?"
m_ex_aria_06_18,"Coin-operated karaoke, for the budget-conscious."
m_ex_aria_06_19,"A karaoke pub, for those who want to sing at the table."
m_ex_aria_06_20,"Wow, I didn't realize such a thing existed."
m_ex_aria_06_21,I might be able to use it for practice.
m_ex_aria_06_22,But you sure know a lot more about karaoke
m_ex_aria_06_23,than I imagined.
m_ex_aria_06_24,Do you go there often?
m_ex_aria_06_25,Hardly.
m_ex_aria_06_26,"Then, how are you so well-informed?"
m_ex_aria_06_27,Because I'm always getting roped into it.
m_ex_aria_06_28,By who?
m_ex_aria_06_29,Someone who lives by the train station.
m_ex_aria_06_30,"In that case,"
m_ex_aria_06_31,"if you go as often as you do,"
m_ex_aria_06_32,you and this mystery person must both be capable singers.
m_ex_aria_06_33,Far from it. Neither of us can carry a tune to save our lives.
m_ex_aria_06_34,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_aria_06_35,You don't have to be good at something to enjoy it.
m_ex_aria_06_36,That's true.
m_ex_aria_06_37,Take me with you next time
m_ex_aria_06_38,and I'll give you some pointers on how to improve your singing.
m_ex_aria_06_39,"Sure, I'll let Diesel know."
m_ex_brid_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_brid_04_2,I apologize for the interruption.
m_ex_brid_04_3,May I have a moment of your time?
m_ex_brid_04_4,"It's okay, what's wrong?"
m_ex_brid_04_5,"A few days ago,"
m_ex_brid_04_6,I stopped by your room to deliver some documents.
m_ex_brid_04_7,"If I may be so bold,"
m_ex_brid_04_8,may I suggest paying closer attention to organizing and maintaining your living space?
m_ex_brid_04_9,It would benefit both your mental and physical health.
m_ex_brid_04_10,Was it that dirty?
m_ex_brid_04_11,I think it's quite clean.
m_ex_brid_04_12,Yes.
m_ex_brid_04_13,It's the worst I've ever seen.
m_ex_brid_04_14,...
m_ex_brid_04_15,I think your standards need adjusting.
m_ex_brid_04_16,Working in such substandard conditions
m_ex_brid_04_17,will undoubtedly hinder your productivity.
m_ex_brid_04_18,No wonder Rapi seems to be having a hard time.
m_ex_brid_04_19,How could she not?
m_ex_brid_04_20,"At the very least,"
m_ex_brid_04_21,any and all leftover food
m_ex_brid_04_22,should be dealt with immediately.
m_ex_brid_04_23,That's Anis' doing.
m_ex_brid_04_24,"Then, there's the crate of ammunition"
m_ex_brid_04_25,and bullets also carelessly  scattered everywhere.
m_ex_brid_04_26,"It'd be bad enough if you were to trip over one of them,"
m_ex_brid_04_27,but stepping on them could also potentially cause one to go off.
m_ex_brid_04_28,Oh...
m_ex_brid_04_29,"Not only is it dirty,"
m_ex_brid_04_30,but it's dangerous too.
m_ex_brid_04_31,You can blame Neon for that.
m_ex_brid_04_32,And the recycling is a mess as well.
m_ex_brid_04_33,I know.
m_ex_brid_04_34,The mountain of dirty laundry is practically up to the ceiling.
m_ex_brid_04_35,...
m_ex_brid_04_36,And the laundry isn't even separated by color.
m_ex_brid_04_37,What in the world is going on here?
m_ex_brid_04_38,"It's your responsibility to maintain order, Commander,"
m_ex_brid_04_39,and you're failing miserably.
m_ex_brid_04_40,"You're right, it's all my fault T_T"
m_ex_brid_04_41,I guess there's no other choice.
m_ex_brid_04_42,I suppose I can
m_ex_brid_04_43,spare about 30 minutes tomorrow.
m_ex_brid_04_44,What for?
m_ex_brid_04_45,Help you with the cleaning.
m_ex_brid_04_46,Inform Anis and Neon
m_ex_brid_04_47,that I'll be coming.
m_ex_brid_04_48,You don't have to do all that for us.
m_ex_brid_04_49,It's not just for you. It's about maintaining my own mental health.
m_ex_brid_04_50,"Besides, I'm used to cleaning the AZX,"
m_ex_brid_04_51,so don't worry.
m_ex_brid_04_52,I'll see you tomorrow.
m_ex_brid_05_1,Commander.
m_ex_brid_05_2,Yes?
m_ex_brid_05_3,"I have a non-work-related question,"
m_ex_brid_05_4,so I'm a bit hesitant to ask...
m_ex_brid_05_5,It's okay.
m_ex_brid_05_6,Did you know that
m_ex_brid_05_7,people around you call me
m_ex_brid_05_8,a workaholic?
m_ex_brid_05_9,"To be honest, I've been calling you that too."
m_ex_brid_05_10,This is the first I've heard of it.
m_ex_brid_05_11,What?!
m_ex_brid_05_12,You have?
m_ex_brid_05_13,"I mean, it's not entirely inaccurate, and I don't mind it all that much,"
m_ex_brid_05_14,though I do find it a tad exaggerated.
m_ex_brid_05_15,"It's a bit disconcerting, I must admit."
m_ex_brid_05_16,"Sure,"
m_ex_brid_05_17,"I may have slept less than 30 hours last week,"
m_ex_brid_05_18,but that's hardly grounds
m_ex_brid_05_19,for calling me a workaholic.
m_ex_brid_05_20,That's a classic case of a workaholic.
m_ex_brid_05_21,Is that so?
m_ex_brid_05_22,Do you not like it when people call you that?
m_ex_brid_05_23,Hmm...
m_ex_brid_05_24,"It sometimes has a positive connotation, you know?"
m_ex_brid_05_25,"Yeah,"
m_ex_brid_05_26,I think so too.
m_ex_brid_05_27,It's not uncommon for one to become so enraptured by something
m_ex_brid_05_28,"that it sparks a mild obsession, wouldn't you agree?"
m_ex_brid_05_29,For example?
m_ex_brid_05_30,Someone you know quite well.
m_ex_brid_05_31,Anis.
m_ex_brid_05_32,She's a bona fide sodaholic.
m_ex_brid_05_33,Very true.
m_ex_brid_05_34,And Neon.
m_ex_brid_05_35,"She's obsessed with the intangible concept of firepower,"
m_ex_brid_05_36,so much so that she constantly goes around shouting it.
m_ex_brid_05_37,True that.
m_ex_brid_05_38,"What about you, Commander? What is it that captivates you?"
m_ex_brid_05_39,I think I'm also a workaholic.
m_ex_brid_05_40,Honestly? I think I'm a Bridholic.
m_ex_brid_05_41,I appreciate you
m_ex_brid_05_42,"trying to make me feel better,"
m_ex_brid_05_43,"yet from my perspective,"
m_ex_brid_05_44,you don't qualify.
m_ex_brid_05_45,"I was being serious, you know..."
m_ex_brid_05_46,I wasn't expecting a joke in response.
m_ex_brid_05_47,"Anyway, I'm sorry to have bothered you during work."
m_ex_brid_06_1,"Hey, Brid? Are you at work?"
m_ex_brid_06_2,"Hi, Commander."
m_ex_brid_06_3,I apologize for the late response.
m_ex_brid_06_4,I hope I'm not disturbing you when you're busy.
m_ex_brid_06_5,"Not at all. I just completed some urgent tasks,"
m_ex_brid_06_6,and now I'm having a quick coffee break.
m_ex_brid_06_7,That's nice.
m_ex_brid_06_8,Did you need something?
m_ex_brid_06_9,I'm just checking in to see if you're getting enough rest.
m_ex_brid_06_10,"Oh, right."
m_ex_brid_06_11,I've actually been taking the
m_ex_brid_06_12,occasional coffee break.
m_ex_brid_06_13,Glad to hear that.
m_ex_brid_06_14,Does drinking coffee count as taking a break?
m_ex_brid_06_15,I appreciate your concern.
m_ex_brid_06_16,"For me, it's the best way to relax"
m_ex_brid_06_17,since it also improves my efficiency for my next task.
m_ex_brid_06_18,Sounds like you're a real coffeeholic.
m_ex_brid_06_19,I am.
m_ex_brid_06_20,There's such a wide variety of beans
m_ex_brid_06_21,that you can select one tailored to your mood each day.
m_ex_brid_06_22,"In an attempt to diversity my coffee experience,"
m_ex_brid_06_23,I've been testing out new brewing methods.
m_ex_brid_06_24,Like what?
m_ex_brid_06_25,"First, you've got coffee pod machines."
m_ex_brid_06_26,A machine channels boiling water through a small capsule packed with compressed powder.
m_ex_brid_06_27,"With that, it extracts strong flavored coffee in mere seconds."
m_ex_brid_06_28,That must produce a rich flavor.
m_ex_brid_06_29,"Yes, it does."
m_ex_brid_06_30,"It's also convenient to drink when I'm busy,"
m_ex_brid_06_31,so it's the method I use the most.
m_ex_brid_06_32,"Having said that,"
m_ex_brid_06_33,"the best coffee are ones that require time and effort,"
m_ex_brid_06_34,like siphon coffee.
m_ex_brid_06_35,Siphon coffee? What's that?
m_ex_brid_06_36,"Well,"
m_ex_brid_06_37,this method utilizes steam from below as a heat source
m_ex_brid_06_38,to extract the coffee.
m_ex_brid_06_39,It's quite enjoyable and feels like you're conducting a science experiment.
m_ex_brid_06_40,"Above all else, the taste is incomparable."
m_ex_brid_06_41,Interesting.
m_ex_brid_06_42,"And recently, I purchased a new device."
m_ex_brid_06_43,"It uses a modified version of a rocket engine cylinder,"
m_ex_brid_06_44,and the name is absolutely stellar.
m_ex_brid_06_45,It's called a Space Rocket Coffee Maker.
m_ex_brid_06_46,Is that actually a real thing?
m_ex_brid_06_47,Is it safe?
m_ex_brid_06_48,It sure is.
m_ex_brid_06_49,"It may be a bit over the top just for making a cup of coffee,"
m_ex_brid_06_50,but it really does provide you
m_ex_brid_06_51,with a bold and powerful cup of java.
m_ex_brid_06_52,"Now, you've got me curious."
m_ex_brid_06_53,"If you like, you can come over and try some."
m_ex_brid_06_54,I'll be right there.
m_ex_brid_06_55,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_centi_04_1,Boss!
m_ex_centi_04_2,"I know this is a bit sudden,"
m_ex_centi_04_3,but can you tell me
m_ex_centi_04_4,what you think of Liter?
m_ex_centi_04_5,Where's this coming from?
m_ex_centi_04_6,"I know that Liter can come off as cold,"
m_ex_centi_04_7,"but once you get to know her, she's actually a really warm person."
m_ex_centi_04_8,I'm worried people might misunderstand her.
m_ex_centi_04_9,I really like Liter.
m_ex_centi_04_10,You should respect your elders.
m_ex_centi_04_11,Do you really mean that?
m_ex_centi_04_12,It feels like it's lacking conviction.
m_ex_centi_04_13,Is that the only reason you treat her with respect?
m_ex_centi_04_14,"If that's true, I feel kinda bad for her..."
m_ex_centi_04_15,"Then, what do you think of her?"
m_ex_centi_04_16,Me?
m_ex_centi_04_17,"You're the one who's closest to her, so your opinion matters most."
m_ex_centi_04_18,I obviously
m_ex_centi_04_19,hold Liter in high regard!
m_ex_centi_04_20,She treats me incredibly well!
m_ex_centi_04_21,For example?
m_ex_centi_04_22,She always sends me messages
m_ex_centi_04_23,in codes that are tough to crack!
m_ex_centi_04_24,That's her way
m_ex_centi_04_25,of teaching me to always use my head
m_ex_centi_04_26,and hone my creative skills!
m_ex_centi_04_27,Um... They could also just be typos.
m_ex_centi_04_28,"Plus,"
m_ex_centi_04_29,"she can nag about trivial things for 14 hours straight,"
m_ex_centi_04_30,"ignore me when she's in the wrong,"
m_ex_centi_04_31,"gives Volt better meals than me,"
m_ex_centi_04_32,and pretend to be sick
m_ex_centi_04_33,just to send me to Syuen whenever she calls.
m_ex_centi_04_34,Sounds to me like you're complaining an awful lot about her.
m_ex_centi_04_35,"In any case, I respect Liter a whole bunch!"
m_ex_centi_05_1,All-Knowing Boss!
m_ex_centi_05_2,Do you know what a Swiss army knife is?
m_ex_centi_05_3,"Aaaah... Yes, of course!"
m_ex_centi_05_4,Is it the popular toy that's in vogue these days?
m_ex_centi_05_5,Your reaction tells me that you actually don't have a clue.
m_ex_centi_05_6,You might just hurt yourself if you treat it as a toy!
m_ex_centi_05_7,"I know, it's a knife isn't it?"
m_ex_centi_05_8,I knew you'd be familiar with it!
m_ex_centi_05_9,"But, it's no ordinary knife."
m_ex_centi_05_10,"Besides the knife blade, it's packed with all sorts of other features."
m_ex_centi_05_11,Like?
m_ex_centi_05_12,"It comes with a screwdriver,"
m_ex_centi_05_13,"a pair of scissors, a bottle opener, a toothpick,"
m_ex_centi_05_14,"pliers, and even a hammer!"
m_ex_centi_05_15,Sounds quite convenient.
m_ex_centi_05_16,"Also, I heard that if you go to a specialty shop,"
m_ex_centi_05_17,they'll hook you up with any extra features you're after.
m_ex_centi_05_18,"So, I wanted to ask:"
m_ex_centi_05_19,what features would you like to add?
m_ex_centi_05_20,A stun gun for emergencies.
m_ex_centi_05_21,An alarm that I can use if I'm in trouble.
m_ex_centi_05_22,"Oooh, that'd be really useful"
m_ex_centi_05_23,for someone as important as you!
m_ex_centi_05_24,"That's a good idea,"
m_ex_centi_05_25,especially 'cause you're weak and can't defend yourself.
m_ex_centi_05_26,What about you?
m_ex_centi_05_27,"I've been thinking about it,"
m_ex_centi_05_28,but I can't seem to decide.
m_ex_centi_05_29,I just wanna cram in everything imaginable!
m_ex_centi_05_30,"Every little detail, every possibility! I want it all in there!"
m_ex_centi_05_31,Why don't you make one yourself then?
m_ex_centi_05_32,!!
m_ex_centi_05_33,"Then, I can add all the features I want!"
m_ex_centi_05_34,I didn't even think of that!
m_ex_centi_05_35,"I bet trying out all those different features would totally level up my skills, too!"
m_ex_centi_05_36,Exactly!
m_ex_centi_05_37,"Wow, my motivation is through the roof!"
m_ex_centi_05_38,"Thanks, Boss!"
m_ex_centi_06_1,"Boss,"
m_ex_centi_06_2,can I bother you for a moment?
m_ex_centi_06_3,What's going on?
m_ex_centi_06_4,"Not many requests are coming in, so I'm bored."
m_ex_centi_06_5,I feel like my skills are gonna get rusty.
m_ex_centi_06_6,Can you please let me make something?
m_ex_centi_06_7,Pretty please!
m_ex_centi_06_8,There's a half-finished model kit that I gave up on.
m_ex_centi_06_9,Why don't you ask Liter?
m_ex_centi_06_10,Are you really gonna ask Mighty Tools to finish up your model kit?
m_ex_centi_06_11,"If Liter finds out, she'd sic Volt on me!"
m_ex_centi_06_12,"I did, and she asked me to talk to you."
m_ex_centi_06_13,"In that case, I might have something for you."
m_ex_centi_06_14,Oh! What is it?
m_ex_centi_06_15,It's the shower room door in the Commander's Room...
m_ex_centi_06_16,"Okay, I'm on it!"
m_ex_centi_06_17,"Hold on, I haven't said what's wrong with it yet."
m_ex_centi_06_18,On my way!
m_ex_centi_06_19,W-wait!
m_ex_centi_06_20,This'll be a piece of cake!!
m_ex_centi_06_21,You should have listened to the details first.
m_ex_centi_06_22,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_centi_06_23,"So what's the problem, exactly?"
m_ex_centi_06_24,I've been noticing a weird sound when I open and close the door.
m_ex_centi_06_25,Hmm...
m_ex_centi_06_26,The latch must have rusted from all that water exposure.
m_ex_centi_06_27,Might as well swap out the entire shower door while I'm at it. Sound good to you?
m_ex_centi_06_28,That's fine with me.
m_ex_centi_06_29,What design do you prefer?
m_ex_centi_06_30,A pristine glass door.
m_ex_centi_06_31,A door with intricate patterns.
m_ex_centi_06_32,"Okay, so something modern and sophisticated."
m_ex_centi_06_33,Got it!
m_ex_centi_06_34,I'll prepare a top-notch crystal door that's entirely resistant to water stains.
m_ex_centi_06_35,Like the ones you see in a hotel?
m_ex_centi_06_36,"In that case, I'll switch out the wall tiles for black marble to match the shower door better!"
m_ex_centi_06_37,You don't have to go that far.
m_ex_centi_06_38,I won't take no for an answer!
m_ex_centi_06_39,I'll get the construction started right away!
m_ex_centi_06_40,"As for the estimate, I say it'll be around one million credits."
m_ex_centi_06_41,That much?!
m_ex_centi_06_42,I'll discuss the details with Rapi.
m_ex_centi_06_43,You'll have a brand-spankin' new bathroom in no time!
m_ex_emma_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_04_2,I've got something good for you!
m_ex_emma_04_3,"Sorry, but I'm stuffed."
m_ex_emma_04_4,"Oh, I wasn't talking about food."
m_ex_emma_04_5,"But if you want to try my food so badly,"
m_ex_emma_04_6,you can just let me know!
m_ex_emma_04_7,"Just say the word, Commander,"
m_ex_emma_04_8,and I'll send you a special lunchbox ^__^
m_ex_emma_04_9,"No, I'm honestly quite full."
m_ex_emma_04_10,Are you saying that because you're worried about inconveniencing me?
m_ex_emma_04_11,"It's okay, really ^__^"
m_ex_emma_04_12,"Nothing makes me happier than making something delicious for you, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_04_13,"... Anyway, what was it that you wanted to tell me?"
m_ex_emma_04_14,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_emma_04_15,"Surely you haven't forgotten about my specialty in full-body massages, have you?"
m_ex_emma_04_16,"After all, you've been on the receiving end more times than I can count!"
m_ex_emma_04_17,"Yes, of course."
m_ex_emma_04_18,"The thing about full body massages, though, is that"
m_ex_emma_04_19,they require specific oils and a comfortable place to lie down.
m_ex_emma_04_20,"There's a bunch of stuff to get ready,"
m_ex_emma_04_21,so it's quite a hassle...
m_ex_emma_04_22,"So, I've been in the library for the past few days,"
m_ex_emma_04_23,researching on an ancient method for promoting blood circulation
m_ex_emma_04_24,that was widely used on the surface in the past!
m_ex_emma_04_25,Go on...
m_ex_emma_04_26,I can tell you that it involves needles.
m_ex_emma_04_27,As in those used for sewing?
m_ex_emma_04_28,Yep!
m_ex_emma_04_29,Those needles are also used in traditional Eastern medicine.
m_ex_emma_04_30,Have you ever heard about
m_ex_emma_04_31,those energy points in a human body?
m_ex_emma_04_32,I have.
m_ex_emma_04_33,"If you insert needles in those spots and stimulate them,"
m_ex_emma_04_34,you'll be amazed!
m_ex_emma_04_35,It dramatically increases your blood flow
m_ex_emma_04_36,and alleviates both stiffness and lethargy!
m_ex_emma_04_37,"So, I wanted to try it out on you straight away!"
m_ex_emma_04_38,Do you know how?
m_ex_emma_04_39,"The books didn't specify the size of the needle,"
m_ex_emma_04_40,"so I figured the bigger, the better."
m_ex_emma_04_41,"That's why, I've got a needle here thick enough to split rock!"
m_ex_emma_04_42,Don't you think it's dangerous?
m_ex_emma_04_43,Hmm... I guess jabbing someone with this might be a tad dangerous.
m_ex_emma_04_44,"Come to think of it, when I tried to test it out on Eunhwa,"
m_ex_emma_04_45,she told me off and screamed that I was trying to kill her.
m_ex_emma_04_46,I think you ought to learn the procedure in detail first.
m_ex_emma_04_47,I guess so...
m_ex_emma_04_48,"Okay, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_04_49,I'll hit the books real quick so that I can improve your blood flow sooner! ^__^
m_ex_emma_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_05_2,I have something to discuss with you.
m_ex_emma_05_3,"I'm busy at the moment, so I'll listen to it later."
m_ex_emma_05_4,"Whatever you're going to say, I agree with all of it."
m_ex_emma_05_5,Hmm?
m_ex_emma_05_6,I know you're not busy right now.
m_ex_emma_05_7,Rapi just told me about it.
m_ex_emma_05_8,Hmm?
m_ex_emma_05_9,"I know you pretty well and how you'll react to things,"
m_ex_emma_05_10,but I still want to hear your opinion.
m_ex_emma_05_11,Sure. What is it?
m_ex_emma_05_12,Eunhwa really chewed me out a second ago.
m_ex_emma_05_13,"She said my skirt was too short,"
m_ex_emma_05_14,and that just looking at it made her feel cold.
m_ex_emma_05_15,I'm supposed to lengthen it to knee-length too!
m_ex_emma_05_16,"Jeez, you should have seen her scowl!"
m_ex_emma_05_17,I can certainly imagine.
m_ex_emma_05_18,"But, I think short skirts"
m_ex_emma_05_19,are easy to move around in
m_ex_emma_05_20,and they look really good on me!
m_ex_emma_05_21,"What do you think, Commander?"
m_ex_emma_05_22,I think you look perfect just the way you are.
m_ex_emma_05_23,You should wear longer skirts only when it's cold.
m_ex_emma_05_24,"Hehe, thanks!"
m_ex_emma_05_25,I like the way I look too.
m_ex_emma_05_26,"Aw, come on!"
m_ex_emma_05_27,"I just can't bear to part with cuteness, even in this chilly weather!"
m_ex_emma_05_28,"But oh dear, I can already hear Eunhwa's voice in my head. What should I do? T_T"
m_ex_emma_05_29,Why don't you suggest to Eunhwa that she wear a skirt?
m_ex_emma_05_30,"Oooh,"
m_ex_emma_05_31,that'd be fun!
m_ex_emma_05_32,"Speaking of which, she hates them"
m_ex_emma_05_33,and would never try one out herself!
m_ex_emma_05_34,"But if she gives it a shot this time,"
m_ex_emma_05_35,she might just find herself head over heels for it!
m_ex_emma_05_36,Just don't mention that it was my idea.
m_ex_emma_05_37,"Haha, it'll be fine ^__^"
m_ex_emma_05_38,I'll tell her that you really want to see her in a skirt.
m_ex_emma_05_39,"Ah, here she comes now!"
m_ex_emma_05_40,Emmmaaaa!!
m_ex_emma_05_41,"See you next time, Commander ^__^"
m_ex_emma_06_1,"Hi, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_06_2,"Hello, Emma."
m_ex_emma_06_3,Rapi told me
m_ex_emma_06_4,work has been
m_ex_emma_06_5,wearing you down lately!
m_ex_emma_06_6,It's nothing serious.
m_ex_emma_06_7,"Just some dizziness, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and brain fog."
m_ex_emma_06_8,I figured you'd say that.
m_ex_emma_06_9,"Whenever you say there's no issue,"
m_ex_emma_06_10,you have to assume the opposite is true.
m_ex_emma_06_11,"At least, that's what Rapi told me."
m_ex_emma_06_12,"Oh my goodness, that sounds serious!"
m_ex_emma_06_13,I'm used to it by now.
m_ex_emma_06_14,How about I treat you to some therapy?
m_ex_emma_06_15,I've just expanded my collection of essential oils
m_ex_emma_06_16,and would love an opportunity to test them out :3
m_ex_emma_06_17,What do you have?
m_ex_emma_06_18,"Quite a few new additions, but I'd especially recommend"
m_ex_emma_06_19,jasmine or rose oil.
m_ex_emma_06_20,Which would you prefer?
m_ex_emma_06_21,Jasmine oil.
m_ex_emma_06_22,Rose oil.
m_ex_emma_06_23,Good choice!
m_ex_emma_06_24,"Jasmine oil relieves nervousness,"
m_ex_emma_06_25,"and has substantial recuperative effects, both physically and mentally."
m_ex_emma_06_26,"The effects are so pronounced, that even those around you will feel more energized!"
m_ex_emma_06_27,Roses reign supreme when it comes to fragrances ^__^
m_ex_emma_06_28,I added in a few secret ingredients into a special essential oil blend
m_ex_emma_06_29,that I call Rose Absolute.
m_ex_emma_06_30,The scent is so intense and captivating
m_ex_emma_06_31,that anyone who catches a whiff instantly falls in love with it.
m_ex_emma_06_32,That's amazing!
m_ex_emma_06_33,IKR!!
m_ex_emma_06_34,"But hey, there's something you should know."
m_ex_emma_06_35,"If you don't get the amounts just right,"
m_ex_emma_06_36,it might make you a little nervous and agitated.
m_ex_emma_06_37,"Don't you worry, though!"
m_ex_emma_06_38,I'm a pro at this ^__^
m_ex_emma_06_39,Don't you have something a bit more... ordinary?
m_ex_emma_06_40,Huh?
m_ex_emma_06_41,I thought rose and jasmine oils are ordinary?
m_ex_emma_06_42,"All right, then. Why don't we use the most ordinary scent of all,"
m_ex_emma_06_43,the lavender oil?
m_ex_emma_06_44,It smells wonderful and is excellent for stress relief.
m_ex_emma_06_45,"Yeah, that sounds good."
m_ex_emma_06_46,"Okay, then."
m_ex_emma_06_47,I'll prepare some for you! :3
m_ex_eunhwa_04_1,"Hey, Weakling."
m_ex_eunhwa_04_2,"I couldn't care less about you,"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_3,"but if you can't perform adequately,"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_4,"it'll hinder our mission, don't you think?"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_5,What are you getting at?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_6,Have you been eating properly?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_7,What makes you ask?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_8,Just answer the question.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_9,Have you been eating properly?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_10,I guess.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_11,My diet mainly consists of instant food.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_12,I guess...?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_13,You talk like someone
m_ex_eunhwa_04_14,who doesn't give a damn about their own body.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_15,"Tsk,"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_16,that's why you'll always be weak!
m_ex_eunhwa_04_17,Why are you so interested in my diet all of a sudden?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_18,"Last time I saw you, you looked like a walking corpse."
m_ex_eunhwa_04_19,"Come on, it's not that bad."
m_ex_eunhwa_04_20,A healthy body contributes to a healthy mind.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_21,Didn't they teach you that at the military academy?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_22,Nothing irritates me more than
m_ex_eunhwa_04_23,seeing someone neglect and mistreat their own health.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_24,Also...
m_ex_eunhwa_04_25,There's more?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_26,What's up with those dark circles
m_ex_eunhwa_04_27,under your eyes?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_28,Work has been keeping me up lately.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_29,I've been staying up late binge-watching TV shows.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_30,You moron.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_31,Sleep is paramount
m_ex_eunhwa_04_32,to maintaining proper focus on the battlefield.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_33,That's it.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_34,Are you in the Commander's Room now?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_35,"Don't move,"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_36,I'm coming over there to set you straight.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_37,I'm sorry.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_38,And one more thing.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_39,What in the world is going on with your shirt?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_40,It's full of wrinkles.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_41,I haven't had time to iron it.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_42,"Jeez, give me a break..."
m_ex_eunhwa_04_43,How can you expect other units to respect us
m_ex_eunhwa_04_44,when you step outside looking like a bum?
m_ex_eunhwa_04_45,You should at least dress prim and proper.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_46,You seem to have a lot of interest in me.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_47,Don't be an idiot.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_48,I shouldn't have to remind you that
m_ex_eunhwa_04_49,those who don't take care of themselves off the battlefield are the first ones to die.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_50,Take my advice and pull yourself together. I don't care how busy you are.
m_ex_eunhwa_04_51,"Got it, thanks!"
m_ex_eunhwa_04_52,...
m_ex_eunhwa_05_1,"Hey, Weakling."
m_ex_eunhwa_05_2,Eunhwa? What a surprise.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_3,...
m_ex_eunhwa_05_4,"Ugh,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_5,I knew I'd regret sending you a message.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_6,You should be honest with your feelings now.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_7,"You're on thin ice, Weakling."
m_ex_eunhwa_05_8,My sniper rifle
m_ex_eunhwa_05_9,can penetrate through many barriers and travel vast distances.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_10,I suggest you hold your tongue.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_11,"Hehe. Anyway, what was it you had to say?"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_12,Tsk.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_13,I heard something strange from Emma.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_14,"She said that if you frown every day,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_15,"misfortune will befall you, and you'll also get wrinkles."
m_ex_eunhwa_05_16,That sounds something like what Emma would say.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_17,Ha!
m_ex_eunhwa_05_18,"If I were to heed her advice, I'd find myself parading around with a moronic smile plastered on my face"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_19,"like that soda-obsessed ignoramus from the Counters,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_20,or that self-proclaimed hero in Matis.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_21,Do you think that's possible?
m_ex_eunhwa_05_22,They do say that smiling brings good luck and helps prevent wrinkles.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_23,... What utter nonsense!
m_ex_eunhwa_05_24,"Just listening to drivel like that,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_25,I'll be as dumb as you before long.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_26,I just want to see your smile.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_27,"The moment I became a Nikke,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_28,laughter became a thing of the past.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_29,I don't do smiles.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_30,I believe what Emma meant is that you just need to loosen up a bit.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_31,??
m_ex_eunhwa_05_32,"You don't have to force yourself to smile all the time, but..."
m_ex_eunhwa_05_33,Uh-huh?
m_ex_eunhwa_05_34,It's not good to be so hard on yourself all the time.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_35,...
m_ex_eunhwa_05_36,"Weakling,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_37,"you may be a third-rate Commander who's beyond saving,"
m_ex_eunhwa_05_38,but even you sometimes manage to say something meaningful.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_39,"You're still a far cry from Vesti, though."
m_ex_eunhwa_05_40,I'm glad I was able to comfort you.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_41,Tsk.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_42,Don't get a big head about it.
m_ex_eunhwa_05_43,Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_1,"Weakling,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_2,you should stop joking around.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_3,The sheer incompetence of your commanding back there was stunning.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_4,You got a whole bunch of our comrades killed.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_5,"Hey, are you listening to me?"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_6,I'm sorry.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_7,You think apologizing will make this all better?
m_ex_eunhwa_06_8,"You're a Commander, so do your job."
m_ex_eunhwa_06_9,Why did you insist on a frontal assault?
m_ex_eunhwa_06_10,"If you bothered to assess our strength against the enemy's,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_11,you'd have realized that a head-on encounter was nothing short of suicidal.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_12,You should have ordered the rear support to retreat
m_ex_eunhwa_06_13,and had the vanguards in the 1st unit draw their attention.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_14,You have to be able to think on your feet and make proper judgments.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_15,"It's your duty, a burden you bear alone."
m_ex_eunhwa_06_16,"I don't care if you're a human,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_17,that's no excuse for screwing up like you did.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_18,I thought we could win with the team we had.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_19,"I trusted my judgment, and it turns out I was wrong."
m_ex_eunhwa_06_20,I thought as much.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_21,"Anyway, we could sit here all night dissecting what went wrong,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_22,but it won't bring back our dead comrades.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_23,Have you been brainwashed by those idiots around you?
m_ex_eunhwa_06_24,You were behaving like a mindless drone.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_25,You moron...
m_ex_eunhwa_06_26,I would defend myself... but you're right.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_27,I never thought you could be this incompetent.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_28,That was a battle we could have won.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_29,"You alone serve as undeniable evidence that when the Commander lacks competence,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_30,everything else becomes futile.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_31,"I'm sorry about losing the battle, but..."
m_ex_eunhwa_06_32,"What? After such an ignominious defeat, what could you possibly have to say for yourself?"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_33,Why are you getting so angry over a PvP match?
m_ex_eunhwa_06_34,??
m_ex_eunhwa_06_35,Say that again. I dare you.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_36,Never mind.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_37,I couldn't care less whether the battle is real or simulated.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_38,"Victory is inevitable for me in every single one,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_39,and don't you ever forget that.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_40,Noted.
m_ex_eunhwa_06_41,"Good. Now, if you think you can handle it,"
m_ex_eunhwa_06_42,let's play another match.
m_ex_guillotine_04_1,"To the apostle of rebellion lurking in the abyss,"
m_ex_guillotine_04_2,heed to the bloodcurdling roar
m_ex_guillotine_04_3,of Guillotine De Mephisto.
m_ex_guillotine_04_4,I take it that means you want me to respond to your message?
m_ex_guillotine_04_5,My apologies.
m_ex_guillotine_04_6,"Old habits die hard, and some from my human days still persist."
m_ex_guillotine_04_7,"It cannot be helped,"
m_ex_guillotine_04_8,especially when you have been bound to the Big O for so long.
m_ex_guillotine_04_9,What's going on?
m_ex_guillotine_04_10,This is the first time
m_ex_guillotine_04_11,I have spoken with you
m_ex_guillotine_04_12,since the Harmonious Banquet was held.
m_ex_guillotine_04_13,Are you referring to the party held at Elysion?
m_ex_guillotine_04_14,"The ceaseless wails of those offerings,"
m_ex_guillotine_04_15,they give me no peace!
m_ex_guillotine_04_16,Hehehehe...
m_ex_guillotine_04_17,Bwahahahaha!
m_ex_guillotine_04_18,Your main point is...?
m_ex_guillotine_04_19,"Why exactly are you here, Guillotine De Mephisto?"
m_ex_guillotine_04_20,Sigh...
m_ex_guillotine_04_21,It would appear
m_ex_guillotine_04_22,Big O's sinister has not cleared from you just yet.
m_ex_guillotine_04_23,You require rectification.
m_ex_guillotine_04_24,"Why exactly are you here, Guillotine De Mephisto?"
m_ex_guillotine_04_25,The reason I am here
m_ex_guillotine_04_26,"is to ask you to form a blood pact with the Grimoire,"
m_ex_guillotine_04_27,the one who exists for the balance of the world.
m_ex_guillotine_04_28,However...
m_ex_guillotine_04_29,"In order to achieve that, a price must be paid."
m_ex_guillotine_04_30,And I suppose I'm the one who has to cough up the dough?
m_ex_guillotine_04_31,Hehe...
m_ex_guillotine_04_32,I knew that you would understand.
m_ex_guillotine_04_33,It's said that a flower's bloom is most beautiful in isolation.
m_ex_guillotine_04_34,Are you asking me to create a new account?
m_ex_guillotine_04_35,You might have to lay bare your raison d'etre.
m_ex_guillotine_04_36,I've entered... my personal information.
m_ex_guillotine_04_37,I look forward to meeting the great genius
m_ex_guillotine_04_38,under the inevitable wheel of fate.
m_ex_guillotine_04_39,I also followed your account.
m_ex_guillotine_04_40,"In this time of great chaos, I will cherish this moment."
m_ex_guillotine_04_41,It wasn't that big a deal.
m_ex_guillotine_04_42,"For those who break the oath,"
m_ex_guillotine_04_43,may they suffer the eternal torment of the crimson flame.
m_ex_guillotine_04_44,"Don't worry, I won't unfollow you."
m_ex_guillotine_04_45,Hehehe...
m_ex_guillotine_04_46,"Until we meet again, I shall abstain from saying farewell."
m_ex_guillotine_05_1,"Partner,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_2,I want to tell you something.
m_ex_guillotine_05_3,What is it?
m_ex_guillotine_05_4,Sealed in this right eye of mine
m_ex_guillotine_05_5,is the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_guillotine_05_6,I am doing everything in my power
m_ex_guillotine_05_7,"to prevent that seal from being broken,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_8,but a weakened One-Winged Dark Lord is a One-Winged Dark Lord nonetheless.
m_ex_guillotine_05_9,It is waiting for me to let down my guard.
m_ex_guillotine_05_10,If by any chance
m_ex_guillotine_05_11,"I falter, and the One-Winged Dark Lord is let loose,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_12,you must make a decision.
m_ex_guillotine_05_13,"Submit to the chaos and be engulfed,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_14,or...
m_ex_guillotine_05_15,"entrust everything to me,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_16,Guillotine De Mephisto?
m_ex_guillotine_05_17,I would submit to the chaos.
m_ex_guillotine_05_18,I would trust you.
m_ex_guillotine_05_19,You fool!
m_ex_guillotine_05_20,"I thought you would be different,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_21,but you are indeed just another facile human being...
m_ex_guillotine_05_22,Hehehe!
m_ex_guillotine_05_23,"I knew I could count on you, Partner."
m_ex_guillotine_05_24,Your sentiments resonate deeply with me.
m_ex_guillotine_05_25,"I, Guillotine De Mephisto, will not disappoint you."
m_ex_guillotine_05_26,I will resist until the bitter end.
m_ex_guillotine_05_27,"But, what's your actual plan?"
m_ex_guillotine_05_28,"Should this truly come to pass,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_29,I will summon Adramelech.
m_ex_guillotine_05_30,"Oh, right... that."
m_ex_guillotine_05_31,The legendary demon who's also a Sun God?
m_ex_guillotine_05_32,"Hehe, there's no need for you to feign knowledge."
m_ex_guillotine_05_33,The existence of a legendary demon who also happens to be a Sun God
m_ex_guillotine_05_34,is far beyond the grasp of mere mortals like yourself.
m_ex_guillotine_05_35,My goodness!
m_ex_guillotine_05_36,To know the true form of Adramelech...
m_ex_guillotine_05_37,you are truly no mere mortal.
m_ex_guillotine_05_38,What happens when you summon it?
m_ex_guillotine_05_39,"To summon Adramelech,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_40,a powerful sacrifice is required.
m_ex_guillotine_05_41,"When that time comes,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_42,I must give everything I have.
m_ex_guillotine_05_43,And what will happen to you?
m_ex_guillotine_05_44,"When I said everything, I meant it."
m_ex_guillotine_05_45,"My power alone may not be sufficient to thwart the beast,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_46,so I have no choice but to discard this entire body.
m_ex_guillotine_05_47,"As for you, you must be prepared"
m_ex_guillotine_05_48,for this potential eventuality.
m_ex_guillotine_05_49,I have no intention of giving up on you or this world.
m_ex_guillotine_05_50,!!
m_ex_guillotine_05_51,Hehe...
m_ex_guillotine_05_52,Bwahahahaha!
m_ex_guillotine_05_53,"Your recklessness is most humorous,"
m_ex_guillotine_05_54,but I admire your courage.
m_ex_guillotine_05_55,You manage to liven up
m_ex_guillotine_05_56,even this filthy demonic realm.
m_ex_guillotine_06_1,Partner...
m_ex_guillotine_06_2,Has my voice found its way to you?
m_ex_guillotine_06_3,Yes.
m_ex_guillotine_06_4,I knew it.
m_ex_guillotine_06_5,You are the only partner with whom I have made a covenant with the soul.
m_ex_guillotine_06_6,But even that won't last.
m_ex_guillotine_06_7,What's the matter?
m_ex_guillotine_06_8,"Though it pains me to admit it, but..."
m_ex_guillotine_06_9,"For I, Guillotine De Mephisto,"
m_ex_guillotine_06_10,consumption is approaching.
m_ex_guillotine_06_11,"Does ""consumption"" refer to the eclipse?"
m_ex_guillotine_06_12,"Precisely, Partner."
m_ex_guillotine_06_13,"Soon, when the moon begins to bleed crimson,"
m_ex_guillotine_06_14,"my magical power will rapidly deplete,"
m_ex_guillotine_06_15,in order to suppress the raging power of the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_guillotine_06_16,"Gradually, my strength will wane."
m_ex_guillotine_06_17,"The area below my spine will begin to tremble,"
m_ex_guillotine_06_18,and I will emanate strange sounds.
m_ex_guillotine_06_19,"This curse is most powerful, and my fate is most tragic."
m_ex_guillotine_06_20,They are incomparable in their sheer magnitude.
m_ex_guillotine_06_21,What do you want to eat the most?
m_ex_guillotine_06_22,Are you listening to me?
m_ex_guillotine_06_23,To eat at such a critical moment
m_ex_guillotine_06_24,would be tantamount to
m_ex_guillotine_06_25,giving it to my demonic other half.
m_ex_guillotine_06_26,That is why
m_ex_guillotine_06_27,I practice my ascetic lifestyle.
m_ex_guillotine_06_28,"Even if it means sacrificing myself, it's for the good of the world."
m_ex_guillotine_06_29,Are you in the mood for some steak?
m_ex_guillotine_06_30,Are you in the mood for something sweet?
m_ex_guillotine_06_31,Meat!
m_ex_guillotine_06_32,Argh... Do you hear that?
m_ex_guillotine_06_33,The screams... of the sacrifices...
m_ex_guillotine_06_34,the simmering pulse of impending doom!
m_ex_guillotine_06_35,Dessert!
m_ex_guillotine_06_36,"Using sugary goodness to tempt me, are you?"
m_ex_guillotine_06_37,You are trying to make me a pawn of the One-Winged Dark Lord?!
m_ex_guillotine_06_38,"Do not seduce me so, Partner."
m_ex_guillotine_06_39,"Okay, I'll bring you some."
m_ex_guillotine_06_40,"Very well, you leave me with no choice."
m_ex_guillotine_06_41,This is the burden which I must bear!
m_ex_guillotine_06_42,"Do it then. Bring it to me,"
m_ex_guillotine_06_43,and grant me this catharsis!
m_ex_maiden_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_04_2,is there anything that you long to obtain?
m_ex_maiden_04_3,Not really.
m_ex_maiden_04_4,Loads.
m_ex_maiden_04_5,It would appear material objects hold no sway over you.
m_ex_maiden_04_6,"If that's the case, you probably won't grasp what I'm getting at..."
m_ex_maiden_04_7,"Oh, no. There're loads of things I want to have as well."
m_ex_maiden_04_8,Really?
m_ex_maiden_04_9,What if it's prohibitively expensive?
m_ex_maiden_04_10,Would you still lust after it?
m_ex_maiden_04_11,"If it's that pricey, I might have to think twice about it."
m_ex_maiden_04_12,Hmmm...
m_ex_maiden_04_13,What if you wanted it so badly
m_ex_maiden_04_14,that you couldn't eat
m_ex_maiden_04_15,or sleep?
m_ex_maiden_04_16,"If it was that bad, then I would bite the bullet and buy it."
m_ex_maiden_04_17,Very good.
m_ex_maiden_04_18,I believe I made the right decision.
m_ex_maiden_04_19,What did you buy?
m_ex_maiden_04_20,!!
m_ex_maiden_04_21,Um...
m_ex_maiden_04_22,A shield?
m_ex_maiden_04_23,"A shield? Oh, you're talking about a game?"
m_ex_maiden_04_24,Yes.
m_ex_maiden_04_25,My main character is a tank.
m_ex_maiden_04_26,"In order to maximize my efficiency while minimizing movement,"
m_ex_maiden_04_27,this purchase was essential.
m_ex_maiden_04_28,It's a rare item that doesn't often appear on auction.
m_ex_maiden_04_29,"With this shield, our guild's bound to become unstoppable,"
m_ex_maiden_04_30,and I'll serve an even more vital role amongst the team!
m_ex_maiden_04_31,You're going to extreme lengths to justify this purchase. Just how expensive was it?
m_ex_maiden_04_32,Er...
m_ex_maiden_04_33,How bad could it be?
m_ex_maiden_04_34,...
m_ex_maiden_04_35,"Well, there's nothing necessarily wrong with spending money on something you like."
m_ex_maiden_04_36,Really?
m_ex_maiden_04_37,"After buying this shield,"
m_ex_maiden_04_38,I don't have any Credits left.
m_ex_maiden_04_39,My electricity and water have been cut too.
m_ex_maiden_04_40,??
m_ex_maiden_04_41,I even had to
m_ex_maiden_04_42,dip into our squad's petty cash.
m_ex_maiden_04_43,I'm positive Guillotine even posted something about me online:
m_ex_maiden_04_44,Corrupted roses should be left to wither.
m_ex_maiden_04_45,You may have gone too far in a few places...
m_ex_maiden_04_46,I simply wanted to contribute more to the team.
m_ex_maiden_04_47,"To make that happen, I figured the money wasn't even a concern."
m_ex_maiden_04_48,How are you going to get by now?
m_ex_maiden_04_49,"Well,"
m_ex_maiden_04_50,now that you brought it up...
m_ex_maiden_04_51,could you lend me some Credits by any chance?
m_ex_maiden_04_52,Maiden? Your messages aren't showing up for some reason.
m_ex_maiden_04_53,Commander?
m_ex_maiden_04_54,Commander????
m_ex_maiden_04_55,I think I should avoid Maiden for a while.
m_ex_maiden_05_1,"Thanks for all your hard work today,"
m_ex_maiden_05_2,Commander.
m_ex_maiden_05_3,"You too, Maiden."
m_ex_maiden_05_4,Hehe.
m_ex_maiden_05_5,"I must confess, even playing games has been a challenge as of late."
m_ex_maiden_05_6,Do you have something on your mind?
m_ex_maiden_05_7,"Speaking honestly? Yes, it's the mask."
m_ex_maiden_05_8,What about it?
m_ex_maiden_05_9,I have to wear it all the time.
m_ex_maiden_05_10,"Maybe it's because they can't see my expression,"
m_ex_maiden_05_11,but it seems exceedingly difficult
m_ex_maiden_05_12,to get to know new people.
m_ex_maiden_05_13,"Even when I go to game meetups,"
m_ex_maiden_05_14,it feels like everyone is keeping their distance.
m_ex_maiden_05_15,That must be difficult.
m_ex_maiden_05_16,It is.
m_ex_maiden_05_17,"Because of the mask, I feel like people get the wrong impression about me."
m_ex_maiden_05_18,"It can really get you down sometimes, you know?"
m_ex_maiden_05_19,"Have you ever heard of the story, The Girl Behind the Iron Mask?"
m_ex_maiden_05_20,"No, I've never heard of it."
m_ex_maiden_05_21,The protagonist is a girl who is forced to perpetually wear a mask.
m_ex_maiden_05_22,I see.
m_ex_maiden_05_23,"Baseless rumors spread about how she hides her face because it's disfigured, and people taunt her."
m_ex_maiden_05_24,Poor thing...
m_ex_maiden_05_25,"One day, someone rips off her mask, intending it to be a cruel joke."
m_ex_maiden_05_26,How could someone do something so horrible?!
m_ex_maiden_05_27,"However, behind the mask lay the face of a strikingly beautiful girl."
m_ex_maiden_05_28,!!
m_ex_maiden_05_29,This is quite interesting.
m_ex_maiden_05_30,I feel like there are many parallels between this story and myself.
m_ex_maiden_05_31,I think so too.
m_ex_maiden_05_32,Perhaps the story was modeled after you.
m_ex_maiden_05_33,Truly...
m_ex_maiden_05_34,You really think so?
m_ex_maiden_05_35,"Ah,"
m_ex_maiden_05_36,"but there's a big difference, though."
m_ex_maiden_05_37,The story painted her
m_ex_maiden_05_38,"as breathtakingly beautiful,"
m_ex_maiden_05_39,but that's not exactly me.
m_ex_maiden_05_40,I disagree.
m_ex_maiden_05_41,What?
m_ex_maiden_05_42,"When I say you and the story are similar, that was one of the key similarities in my mind."
m_ex_maiden_05_43,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_05_44,will you marry me?
m_ex_maiden_05_45,Excuse me?
m_ex_maiden_05_46,"I'm honored that you would propose to me in such a romantic fashion,"
m_ex_maiden_05_47,and my answer...
m_ex_maiden_05_48,is yes!
m_ex_maiden_05_49,Um... I didn't mean it that way...
m_ex_maiden_05_50,"Omg, I'm blushing!"
m_ex_maiden_05_51,"For once,"
m_ex_maiden_05_52,I'm glad I'm wearing a mask.
m_ex_maiden_05_53,"Wait, I..."
m_ex_maiden_05_54,"First thing first, we need to find a venue for the wedding."
m_ex_maiden_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_maiden_06_2,I...
m_ex_maiden_06_3,Um...
m_ex_maiden_06_4,...
m_ex_maiden_06_5,"Ugh,"
m_ex_maiden_06_6,I can't say it.
m_ex_maiden_06_7,What is it?
m_ex_maiden_06_8,You don't have to force yourself to say anything.
m_ex_maiden_06_9,Well...
m_ex_maiden_06_10,!!
m_ex_maiden_06_11,I think there's something wrong with my heart.
m_ex_maiden_06_12,Are you all right?
m_ex_maiden_06_13,My heart keeps pounding constantly.
m_ex_maiden_06_14,We better call Mary.
m_ex_maiden_06_15,We better call Guillotine.
m_ex_maiden_06_16,I'd rather not.
m_ex_maiden_06_17,She'd just jab me with a needle.
m_ex_maiden_06_18,"If we do that, I think my symptoms might get worse."
m_ex_maiden_06_19,What should I do?
m_ex_maiden_06_20,When do the symptoms tend to appear?
m_ex_maiden_06_21,Um...
m_ex_maiden_06_22,"Whenever I think of a certain someone,"
m_ex_maiden_06_23,"my heart starts racing, and won't let up."
m_ex_maiden_06_24,"And who is this ""certain someone""?"
m_ex_maiden_06_25,He has a small scar on his right collarbone that almost resembles a medal.
m_ex_maiden_06_26,"His forearms are as solid as the grip of a sniper rifle,"
m_ex_maiden_06_27,and he's got a perfectly chiseled six-pack.
m_ex_maiden_06_28,And...
m_ex_maiden_06_29,he has three moles on his pelvis!
m_ex_maiden_06_30,Hold on...
m_ex_maiden_06_31,"It's whenever I think of you, Commander."
m_ex_maiden_06_32,That's when my heart starts to beat out of control.
m_ex_maiden_06_33,How did you know about those moles of mine?
m_ex_maiden_06_34,Don't tell me you forgot?
m_ex_maiden_06_35,"A few days ago,"
m_ex_maiden_06_36,we were hanging out
m_ex_maiden_06_37,in your room late at night.
m_ex_maiden_06_38,All we did was playing video games together...
m_ex_maiden_06_39,"You ended up falling asleep in your uniform,"
m_ex_maiden_06_40,so I had no choice but to change you into your pajamas.
m_ex_maiden_06_41,"You ""had to""?"
m_ex_maiden_06_42,I couldn't let your precious uniform get wrinkled.
m_ex_maiden_06_43,Wait...
m_ex_maiden_06_44,You don't need to thank me.
m_ex_maiden_06_45,I got to see a lot of amazing things that day.
m_ex_maiden_06_46,"Even now,"
m_ex_maiden_06_47,just thinking about it sends my heart into a tailspin.
m_ex_maiden_06_48,That's it!
m_ex_maiden_06_49,I need to go see Mary.
m_ex_maiden_06_50,"I'll see you later, Commander."
m_ex_maiden_06_51,"Maiden, waaaait!"
m_ex_maiden_06_52,There is no response from Maiden.
m_ex_n102_04_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_n102_04_2,Teacher.
m_ex_n102_04_3,"Hello, Anne."
m_ex_n102_04_4,"Loads of people approached me today,"
m_ex_n102_04_5,"but I couldn't remember their names,"
m_ex_n102_04_6,so I just stood there.
m_ex_n102_04_7,I see.
m_ex_n102_04_8,Memorizing names is so hard T_T
m_ex_n102_04_9,"If I see them again,"
m_ex_n102_04_10,I want to call them by their names.
m_ex_n102_04_11,What should I do?
m_ex_n102_04_12,Do you remember any distinct features? I can tell you their names.
m_ex_n102_04_13,"Oooh, that'd be great!"
m_ex_n102_04_14,"If you tell me who they are,"
m_ex_n102_04_15,I'll be sure to remember!
m_ex_n102_04_16,Tell me what you can about them.
m_ex_n102_04_17,Hmm...
m_ex_n102_04_18,The first person who spoke to me
m_ex_n102_04_19,gave me some candy.
m_ex_n102_04_20,It was strawberry-flavored and delicious!
m_ex_n102_04_21,"That would be the strawberry fanatic, Diesel."
m_ex_n102_04_22,"Diesel, okay."
m_ex_n102_04_23,I'm writing it down now.
m_ex_n102_04_24,"Next,"
m_ex_n102_04_25,"I was following after an adorable calico cat,"
m_ex_n102_04_26,"and nearly ran smack into a wall,"
m_ex_n102_04_27,but someone stopped me just before I did.
m_ex_n102_04_28,"Her gaze was a bit intense, but she had a really big smile."
m_ex_n102_04_29,"At first, I thought she was some kind of bad guy,"
m_ex_n102_04_30,"but once I got to know her, she's one of the kindest people I know!"
m_ex_n102_04_31,That would be Drake.
m_ex_n102_04_32,I see.
m_ex_n102_04_33,"She'll love it if you exclaim, ""Oh no, a villain!"" when you see her."
m_ex_n102_04_34,Okay!
m_ex_n102_04_35,I'll be sure to do that next time I see her.
m_ex_n102_04_36,There was also someone
m_ex_n102_04_37,"who went on and on about demons and chaos,"
m_ex_n102_04_38,but I couldn't quite make sense of what she was saying.
m_ex_n102_04_39,I presume that's Guillotine. It's perfectly all right if you don't understand her.
m_ex_n102_04_40,"Wow,"
m_ex_n102_04_41,you really do know everyone!
m_ex_n102_04_42,And...
m_ex_n102_04_43,"Wait, there's more?"
m_ex_n102_04_44,"Yeah, I also talked to someone with huuuuge boobs."
m_ex_n102_04_45,... Any other distinguishing characteristics?
m_ex_n102_04_46,Hmm... I can't really remember.
m_ex_n102_04_47,I'll have to pass on this one.
m_ex_n102_04_48,That could apply to so many people...
m_ex_n102_04_49,"I guess there are some things you don't know, Teacher."
m_ex_n102_04_50,It would be easier if you can tell me something more about them.
m_ex_n102_04_51,Hmm...
m_ex_n102_04_52,I'll let you know if I can recall something?
m_ex_n102_04_53,Of course.
m_ex_n102_04_54,"Thanks, Teacher!"
m_ex_n102_05_1,Teacher!
m_ex_n102_05_2,*Pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_3,*Pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_4,Do you know what's making that popping sound?
m_ex_n102_05_5,??
m_ex_n102_05_6,*Pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_7,*Pop pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_8,*Pop pop pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_9,!!
m_ex_n102_05_10,*Pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_11,*Pop pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_12,*Pop pop pop pop pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_13,Do you have one too?
m_ex_n102_05_14,What are you talking about?
m_ex_n102_05_15,It's a plastic sheet with lots of round bubbles on it.
m_ex_n102_05_16,Anis gave me some.
m_ex_n102_05_17,She said it feels really good to pop them.
m_ex_n102_05_18,"Ah, bubble wrap!"
m_ex_n102_05_19,I knew you'd know what it is.
m_ex_n102_05_20,Anis was right.
m_ex_n102_05_21,It's so fun to pop them!
m_ex_n102_05_22,It is quite addictive.
m_ex_n102_05_23,Have you tried rolling it up and squeezing it?
m_ex_n102_05_24,"Hehe,"
m_ex_n102_05_25,so you enjoy it too?
m_ex_n102_05_26,That's great! *Pop pop*
m_ex_n102_05_27,I can't do that! T_T
m_ex_n102_05_28,That'd be such a waste.
m_ex_n102_05_29,I'd be done with it way too quickly... *Pop*
m_ex_n102_05_30,Huh?
m_ex_n102_05_31,What's wrong?
m_ex_n102_05_32,"I found something interesting, Teacher!"
m_ex_n102_05_33,One of the bubbles is shaped like a heart.
m_ex_n102_05_34,It's so cute!
m_ex_n102_05_35,The bubble wrap gods have chosen you.
m_ex_n102_05_36,Exactly!
m_ex_n102_05_37,I've got to show Anis.
m_ex_n102_05_38,I heard that happiness multiplies when you share it with others.
m_ex_n102_05_39,I'm sure she'll appreciate that.
m_ex_n102_05_40,I'll show it to you tomorrow as well.
m_ex_n102_05_41,Looking forward to it.
m_ex_n102_05_42,*Pop pop*
m_ex_n102_06_1,Teacher! Teacher!
m_ex_n102_06_2,"What's the matter, Anne?"
m_ex_n102_06_3,"Rapi, Anis, Neon, and I"
m_ex_n102_06_4,made croquettes.
m_ex_n102_06_5,That's amazing!
m_ex_n102_06_6,Hehe!
m_ex_n102_06_7,"Rapi and I peeled the potatoes together,"
m_ex_n102_06_8,but it was really difficult since it was my first time T_T
m_ex_n102_06_9,"I think Rapi struggled a bit too,"
m_ex_n102_06_10,so some potatoes ended up only half-sized.
m_ex_n102_06_11,Is peeling potatoes really that difficult?
m_ex_n102_06_12,I was told that you have to peel away quite a bit
m_ex_n102_06_13,to remove the sprout because it's toxic.
m_ex_n102_06_14,I think it's just because the two of you are inexperienced.
m_ex_n102_06_15,"Anyway,"
m_ex_n102_06_16,"after that, we prepared the filling."
m_ex_n102_06_17,"Anis said the secret for great taste is carbonated soda,"
m_ex_n102_06_18,so I put in a whole bunch.
m_ex_n102_06_19,"Too much, apparently..."
m_ex_n102_06_20,because Anis ended up yelling at me.
m_ex_n102_06_21,"I can picture that, hehe."
m_ex_n102_06_22,"As for Neon,"
m_ex_n102_06_23,"she said that if you fry the croquettes with maximum firepower,"
m_ex_n102_06_24,it would remove all the carbonation.
m_ex_n102_06_25,"But she may have gone a bit overboard, 'cause the fire got so strong it reached the ceiling and scorched them."
m_ex_n102_06_26,"Then suddenly, it started raining inside somehow."
m_ex_n102_06_27,Did any of you get hurt?
m_ex_n102_06_28,Sounds like the fire sprinkler is triggered.
m_ex_n102_06_29,We're fine!
m_ex_n102_06_30,Fire sprinkler?
m_ex_n102_06_31,What's that?
m_ex_n102_06_32,It's a safety system that sprays water everywhere in case there's a fire.
m_ex_n102_06_33,I'm not surprised that you know that. You know everything!
m_ex_n102_06_34,"It was quite challenging for a few moments,"
m_ex_n102_06_35,but we managed to finish the croquettes!
m_ex_n102_06_36,"There's somewhat burnt and hard,"
m_ex_n102_06_37,"but considering it's our first time making croquettes together,"
m_ex_n102_06_38,I'd still call it a success! ^__^
m_ex_n102_06_39,I'm glad you were able to finish them.
m_ex_n102_06_40,"I was thinking about having some with you, Teacher."
m_ex_n102_06_41,I'll be waiting in the Commander's Room.
m_ex_n102_06_42,Woohoo!
m_ex_n102_06_43,I'll be right there!
m_ex_noise_04_1,"Hey, Producer."
m_ex_noise_04_2,What's up?
m_ex_noise_04_3,People are really digging
m_ex_noise_04_4,this new single that just dropped.
m_ex_noise_04_5,It's been at the top of the charts for two weeks straight.
m_ex_noise_04_6,Everyone's raving about it like it's the greatest thing
m_ex_noise_04_7,and going gaga for it.
m_ex_noise_04_8,It's a great tune.
m_ex_noise_04_9,Did you expect anything less? You're the best!
m_ex_noise_04_10,You gave it a listen too?
m_ex_noise_04_11,I appreciate that!
m_ex_noise_04_12,Ah...
m_ex_noise_04_13,Thank you wonder.
m_ex_noise_04_14,"No, no..."
m_ex_noise_04_15,When did I start getting used to speaking like this?
m_ex_noise_04_16,It seems you are quite satisfied with this plan to change the way you speak.
m_ex_noise_04_17,"No, no way!"
m_ex_noise_04_18,This song's quite different from your usual style.
m_ex_noise_04_19,I knew you'd notice that!
m_ex_noise_04_20,This song is about separation.
m_ex_noise_04_21,"In a world where the Ark and surface are divided,"
m_ex_noise_04_22,this song speaks about the passionate and heartbreaking romance
m_ex_noise_04_23,of lovers forced apart.
m_ex_noise_04_24,No wonder I teared up while listening to it.
m_ex_noise_04_25,Really? You did?
m_ex_noise_04_26,It was a tough subject for me to write about.
m_ex_noise_04_27,I'm glad the lyrics had an impact.
m_ex_noise_04_28,Be sure to listen to it often for me!
m_ex_noise_04_29,Of course! I even bought 500 of your CDs.
m_ex_noise_04_30,500?!
m_ex_noise_04_31,That many?!
m_ex_noise_04_32,They were giving out collectible cards with each album you buy.
m_ex_noise_04_33,Collectible cards?
m_ex_noise_04_34,Were they picture cards?
m_ex_noise_04_35,"Yeah, I'm gonna collect them all."
m_ex_noise_04_36,Are you sure about that?
m_ex_noise_04_37,"I bought 500 copies, so I think it's possible."
m_ex_noise_04_38,You really didn't have to do all this...
m_ex_noise_04_39,I want to do my part in ensuring you stay at the top of the charts.
m_ex_noise_04_40,"Thank you, but 500 copies is a bit overkill, don't you think?"
m_ex_noise_04_41,I'm gonna keep buying more until I collect all the collectible cards.
m_ex_noise_04_42,Hmm...
m_ex_noise_04_43,Do you think my other fans
m_ex_noise_04_44,are buying as many as you are?
m_ex_noise_04_45,I wouldn't doubt it. We all love you.
m_ex_noise_04_46,Wow...
m_ex_noise_04_47,"All right, for the next album,"
m_ex_noise_04_48,I'm going to prepare something special to repay all my loyal fans.
m_ex_noise_04_49,That would be amazing!
m_ex_noise_04_50,"I'll put my heart and soul into it,"
m_ex_noise_04_51,so stay tuned!
m_ex_noise_05_1,"Producer,"
m_ex_noise_05_2,will you be attending the concert tomorrow?
m_ex_noise_05_3,"I've prepared the finest seat in the house for you,"
m_ex_noise_05_4,with the best view.
m_ex_noise_05_5,"Of course, I'll go."
m_ex_noise_05_6,Awesome!
m_ex_noise_05_7,"There obviously won't be any playback at this concert,"
m_ex_noise_05_8,so it's all live.
m_ex_noise_05_9,"That's why, I've put a lot of effort into the stage production"
m_ex_noise_05_10,and really wanted to show you what I've come up with.
m_ex_noise_05_11,I can't wait to see it!
m_ex_noise_05_12,You're always so busy that
m_ex_noise_05_13,I thought you wouldn't be able to come.
m_ex_noise_05_14,I'm thrilled that's not the case!
m_ex_noise_05_15,I've already prepared all the things I need.
m_ex_noise_05_16,Hmm?
m_ex_noise_05_17,What do you need to prepare for a concert?
m_ex_noise_05_18,I had to get a light stick so that I can wave it around during the concert.
m_ex_noise_05_19,??
m_ex_noise_05_20,It's a way of cheering you on.
m_ex_noise_05_21,Ooooh...
m_ex_noise_05_22,I've also got a T-shirt with your face on it.
m_ex_noise_05_23,"Wow, you do?"
m_ex_noise_05_24,"I also had ""Noise 4 Life"" sewed on it."
m_ex_noise_05_25,Noise...
m_ex_noise_05_26,4 Life...
m_ex_noise_05_27,I'll be right there in the front row cheering you on.
m_ex_noise_05_28,Er...
m_ex_noise_05_29,Producer.
m_ex_noise_05_30,How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not a pop idol?
m_ex_noise_05_31,I need to sleep so that I can get in line early in the morning! See you tomorrow!
m_ex_noise_05_32,??
m_ex_noise_05_33,Producer?
m_ex_noise_05_34,I guess you've fallen asleep.
m_ex_noise_05_35,...
m_ex_noise_05_36,Thanks for your support.
m_ex_noise_05_37,I'll try and give you a great show tomorrow.
m_ex_noise_06_1,"Hey, Producer."
m_ex_noise_06_2,How was the show?
m_ex_noise_06_3,I really enjoyed it!
m_ex_noise_06_4,Really?
m_ex_noise_06_5,We had a bit of a snafu with the audio in the middle...
m_ex_noise_06_6,"Sure, but you resolved it almost immediately."
m_ex_noise_06_7,You mean when I sang without the background music?
m_ex_noise_06_8,"Yes, it was amazing!"
m_ex_noise_06_9,Haha.
m_ex_noise_06_10,That's because I didn't want to keep my fans waiting
m_ex_noise_06_11,until the backing track was fixed.
m_ex_noise_06_12,Hearing your voice acapella was spectacular.
m_ex_noise_06_13,"Hehe, I'm glad you liked it!"
m_ex_noise_06_14,How about the stage production? Did you enjoy the choreographed drones?
m_ex_noise_06_15,Absolutely amazing!
m_ex_noise_06_16,"You see,"
m_ex_noise_06_17,I told you that you wouldn't regret coming.
m_ex_noise_06_18,What else did you like?
m_ex_noise_06_19,I'd love to hear your opinion
m_ex_noise_06_20,so I can incorporate it into the next show.
m_ex_noise_06_21,I liked everything!
m_ex_noise_06_22,"Okay, that's nice, but could you perhaps be more specific?"
m_ex_noise_06_23,Hmm... I particularly liked it when you blew me a kiss.
m_ex_noise_06_24,I did?
m_ex_noise_06_25,Don't you remember? It was during the last chorus of the first song.
m_ex_noise_06_26,Hmm...
m_ex_noise_06_27,"The venue is quite large,"
m_ex_noise_06_28,"and the audience area wasn't lit,"
m_ex_noise_06_29,so I doubt I'd be able to
m_ex_noise_06_30,blow a kiss in your direction.
m_ex_noise_06_31,"Impossible, we made eye contact like 3 times!"
m_ex_noise_06_32,"No way, you totally found me!"
m_ex_noise_06_33,Oh...
m_ex_noise_06_34,Weeeell...
m_ex_noise_06_35,"When the spotlight moved across the audience momentarily,"
m_ex_noise_06_36,I might have seen you.
m_ex_noise_06_37,Just for a brief moment.
m_ex_noise_06_38,I'm glad I wore that shirt and made myself stick out.
m_ex_noise_06_39,...
m_ex_noise_06_40,I've gotta get back to working on my new tune.
m_ex_vesti_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_04_2,are you busy?
m_ex_vesti_04_3,Hmm... You probably are.
m_ex_vesti_04_4,Sorry! T_T
m_ex_vesti_04_5,"I heard you barely even have time to sleep these days,"
m_ex_vesti_04_6,and here I am pestering you.
m_ex_vesti_04_7,"Sorry, I just saw your message."
m_ex_vesti_04_8,"I may be busy, but I always have time to message you, Vesti."
m_ex_vesti_04_9,"Oh, okay!"
m_ex_vesti_04_10,I thought I was bothering you while you were busy
m_ex_vesti_04_11,and you were upset with me somehow.
m_ex_vesti_04_12,"Wow, really?"
m_ex_vesti_04_13,That makes me so happy! ^__^
m_ex_vesti_04_14,"To be honest,"
m_ex_vesti_04_15,"I'd love to send you messages every day,"
m_ex_vesti_04_16,but I never know
m_ex_vesti_04_17,what to say T_T
m_ex_vesti_04_18,I wanna have fun conversations with you
m_ex_vesti_04_19,like Anis and Neon do.
m_ex_vesti_04_20,I think you're overthinking this.
m_ex_vesti_04_21,Am I? >_<
m_ex_vesti_04_22,You can just tell me about your day.
m_ex_vesti_04_23,My day?
m_ex_vesti_04_24,"Like, from when I woke up all the way"
m_ex_vesti_04_25,to when I fell asleep?
m_ex_vesti_04_26,Let's focus on the things that you remember.
m_ex_vesti_04_27,Hmm...
m_ex_vesti_04_28,Hmmmmm...
m_ex_vesti_04_29,How about your happiest moments?
m_ex_vesti_04_30,How about your saddest moments?
m_ex_vesti_04_31,Eunhwa gave me another dressing-down today.
m_ex_vesti_04_32,She told me to stop trying to be a one-man band when it comes to killing Raptures.
m_ex_vesti_04_33,And what was your happiest moment today?
m_ex_vesti_04_34,I encountered a horde of Lord-class Raptures
m_ex_vesti_04_35,and was able to destroy them all
m_ex_vesti_04_36,before Emma and Eunhwa got there.
m_ex_vesti_04_37,"As I was looking over the heap of bodies,"
m_ex_vesti_04_38,I felt extremely satisfied.
m_ex_vesti_04_39,"Wow, you're so cool!"
m_ex_vesti_04_40,"Wha... No, I'm not..."
m_ex_vesti_04_41,"Anyway, what's your happiest moment today, Commander?"
m_ex_vesti_04_42,Right now since I'm talking to you.
m_ex_vesti_04_43,>///<
m_ex_vesti_04_44,Really?
m_ex_vesti_04_45,How about the second-happiest moment?
m_ex_vesti_04_46,Ah!
m_ex_vesti_04_47,I think I'm getting more natural at
m_ex_vesti_04_48,chatting with you!
m_ex_vesti_04_49,You see? Nothing to it.
m_ex_vesti_04_50,Really...
m_ex_vesti_04_51,And it's all thanks to you.
m_ex_vesti_04_52,Let's keep it casual like this the next time we message each other.
m_ex_vesti_04_53,Sure thing!
m_ex_vesti_04_54,I can't wait!
m_ex_vesti_05_1,Commander?
m_ex_vesti_05_2,Yes?
m_ex_vesti_05_3,Umm...
m_ex_vesti_05_4,Well...
m_ex_vesti_05_5,...
m_ex_vesti_05_6,Er...
m_ex_vesti_05_7,"Ugh, I knew I can't say it! T_T"
m_ex_vesti_05_8,What's wrong?
m_ex_vesti_05_9,It's just that...
m_ex_vesti_05_10,You'll feel better once you confide in a friend.
m_ex_vesti_05_11,You're right!
m_ex_vesti_05_12,You're the only real friend
m_ex_vesti_05_13,"I have, Commander."
m_ex_vesti_05_14,Uh-huh...?
m_ex_vesti_05_15,Commander...
m_ex_vesti_05_16,Do you think bigger is better?
m_ex_vesti_05_17,Like Emma?
m_ex_vesti_05_18,Wha...?
m_ex_vesti_05_19,...
m_ex_vesti_05_20,Are you talking about... height?
m_ex_vesti_05_21,Are you talking about... you know...?
m_ex_vesti_05_22,No T_T
m_ex_vesti_05_23,So... it's you know...?
m_ex_vesti_05_24,Yes.
m_ex_vesti_05_25,Yes.
m_ex_vesti_05_26,I've been thinking lately.
m_ex_vesti_05_27,"I may not be as well-endowed as Emma,"
m_ex_vesti_05_28,but I think
m_ex_vesti_05_29,I'm at least bigger than Eunhwa.
m_ex_vesti_05_30,But...
m_ex_vesti_05_31,"when I told her that,"
m_ex_vesti_05_32,"she shot me this look,"
m_ex_vesti_05_33,then just scoffed and left.
m_ex_vesti_05_34,"Haha! That sounds like Eunhwa, all right."
m_ex_vesti_05_35,"Anyway, I was thinking of asking Ingrid"
m_ex_vesti_05_36,if it's possible to increase my size
m_ex_vesti_05_37,to something like Emma's.
m_ex_vesti_05_38,What do you think?
m_ex_vesti_05_39,I like you just the way you are.
m_ex_vesti_05_40,>///<
m_ex_vesti_05_41,Really?
m_ex_vesti_05_42,You really think so?
m_ex_vesti_05_43,"Also, this is just between you and me, but..."
m_ex_vesti_05_44,??
m_ex_vesti_05_45,You are bigger than Eunhwa...
m_ex_vesti_05_46,!!
m_ex_vesti_05_47,I knew it!
m_ex_vesti_05_48,I'm going to Eunhwa right away
m_ex_vesti_05_49,and tell her that the Commander agrees with me!
m_ex_vesti_05_50,"No, wait. This has to be our little secret."
m_ex_vesti_05_51,Just between us?
m_ex_vesti_05_52,"Exactly, just between friends!"
m_ex_vesti_05_53,>///<
m_ex_vesti_05_54,Oh!
m_ex_vesti_05_55,Okay!
m_ex_vesti_05_56,"Well, thanks for listening to my concerns, Commander."
m_ex_vesti_06_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_06_2,is this a good time for you?
m_ex_vesti_06_3,What's up?
m_ex_vesti_06_4,Hmm...
m_ex_vesti_06_5,Eunhwa said that
m_ex_vesti_06_6,"darts can be effective training to improve your accuracy,"
m_ex_vesti_06_7,so we're going to go play a few rounds.
m_ex_vesti_06_8,"Ooh, darts are fun!"
m_ex_vesti_06_9,I knew you'd played it before!
m_ex_vesti_06_10,"It was my first time, so I didn't know the rules T_T"
m_ex_vesti_06_11,"I asked Eunhwa,"
m_ex_vesti_06_12,and she told me to just hurl the dart
m_ex_vesti_06_13,toward the middle of the dartboard.
m_ex_vesti_06_14,She said the rules were simple and wanted to start playing straight away.
m_ex_vesti_06_15,That's all she told you?
m_ex_vesti_06_16,That's just the fundamentals.
m_ex_vesti_06_17,I suppose.
m_ex_vesti_06_18,I followed Eunhwa's lead
m_ex_vesti_06_19,"and threw the dart the way she did, but..."
m_ex_vesti_06_20,T_T
m_ex_vesti_06_21,"It was your first try, so it must have been tough."
m_ex_vesti_06_22,Well...
m_ex_vesti_06_23,Did you at least hit the dartboard?
m_ex_vesti_06_24,"Eunhwa's dart was already in the middle,"
m_ex_vesti_06_25,so that is where I sent mine.
m_ex_vesti_06_26,You mean you got a bullseye?
m_ex_vesti_06_27,"Well, sort of. It went through the tail of Eunhwa's dart."
m_ex_vesti_06_28,Whoa!
m_ex_vesti_06_29,"And the dart after that, and after that as well."
m_ex_vesti_06_30,I kept splitting Eunhwa's darts which were already in the center of the board.
m_ex_vesti_06_31,Did Eunhwa say anything?
m_ex_vesti_06_32,She said
m_ex_vesti_06_33,she was a fool for thinking that
m_ex_vesti_06_34,"she could beat me,"
m_ex_vesti_06_35,and then stormed off.
m_ex_vesti_06_36,Do you think she got annoyed that I didn't know the rules?
m_ex_vesti_06_37,I can assure you that's not it.
m_ex_vesti_06_38,Hmm...
m_ex_vesti_06_39,"Could you teach me how to play darts,"
m_ex_vesti_06_40,Commander?
m_ex_vesti_06_41,"If anything, it sounds like you should be teaching me."
m_ex_vesti_06_42,Please? T_T
m_ex_vesti_06_43,I'm a fast learner.
m_ex_vesti_06_44,I'll head over to the Commander's Room right now.
m_ex_vesti_06_45,... Okay.
m_ex_vesti_06_46,I better avoid giving her any demonstrations.
m_ex_volume_04_1,Hey!
m_ex_volume_04_2,Manager!
m_ex_volume_04_3,"Sup, Volume."
m_ex_volume_04_4,Well well!
m_ex_volume_04_5,You're much more hip with your slang now.
m_ex_volume_04_6,I've got you to thank for that.
m_ex_volume_04_7,Nice!
m_ex_volume_04_8,What's up?
m_ex_volume_04_9,I went to the waiting room
m_ex_volume_04_10,after my performance
m_ex_volume_04_11,and saw something weird on the table.
m_ex_volume_04_12,I was wondering if it was something that you'd left.
m_ex_volume_04_13,What was it?
m_ex_volume_04_14,They were these red lumps in this super vivid red liquid.
m_ex_volume_04_15,"When I got a closer look, they seemed to be something that you could eat."
m_ex_volume_04_16,"Ah, yes, those are mine."
m_ex_volume_04_17,!!
m_ex_volume_04_18,I knew it!
m_ex_volume_04_19,"What are they, anyway?"
m_ex_volume_04_20,They're called tteokbokki.
m_ex_volume_04_21,Come again?
m_ex_volume_04_22,Tteokbokki. They're made by boiling rice cakes in a spicy sauce.
m_ex_volume_04_23,OMG! I've never heard of it.
m_ex_volume_04_24,It's a very common dish in the Ark.
m_ex_volume_04_25,It's a very luxurious food item.
m_ex_volume_04_26,"Really? I find that hard to believe,"
m_ex_volume_04_27,because this is the first time I've ever seen it.
m_ex_volume_04_28,That's because you're a big-shot celebrity.
m_ex_volume_04_29,You must be joking.
m_ex_volume_04_30,"If that were the case, I would have tried it before."
m_ex_volume_04_31,"Actually, I was kidding, hehe."
m_ex_volume_04_32,Aha!
m_ex_volume_04_33,"From the looks of it, I didn't think I'd be a fan."
m_ex_volume_04_34,"Looks can be deceiving. I'm sure it tasted fine when you had some, right?"
m_ex_volume_04_35,...
m_ex_volume_04_36,You didn't try any?
m_ex_volume_04_37,Umm...
m_ex_volume_04_38,"Other than how it looked, the smell was..."
m_ex_volume_04_39,It should have smelled fine. I sealed them up tight.
m_ex_volume_04_40,"The instant I entered the waiting room,"
m_ex_volume_04_41,I was punched in the face by the stench.
m_ex_volume_04_42,Far too strong for me.
m_ex_volume_04_43,"It was such an intense smell,"
m_ex_volume_04_44,I couldn't take it...
m_ex_volume_04_45,and so I had a bite.
m_ex_volume_04_46,!!
m_ex_volume_04_47,Um...
m_ex_volume_04_48,And? How was it?
m_ex_volume_04_49,Not bad.
m_ex_volume_04_50,I knew you wouldn't be able to resist that kind of intensity.
m_ex_volume_04_51,Did you hear what I just said?
m_ex_volume_04_52,"I said ""Not bad"", that's all. Not a ringing endorsement."
m_ex_volume_04_53,"However,"
m_ex_volume_04_54,I think some of my staff might like it.
m_ex_volume_04_55,I'm sure they would.
m_ex_volume_04_56,"In that case,"
m_ex_volume_04_57,"Manager,"
m_ex_volume_04_58,could you prepare some for my next performance?
m_ex_volume_05_1,Hey!
m_ex_volume_05_2,Manager.
m_ex_volume_05_3,"I need your opinion on something,"
m_ex_volume_05_4,and I want you to be honest.
m_ex_volume_05_5,What's up?
m_ex_volume_05_6,"When it comes to writing songs,"
m_ex_volume_05_7,lyrics and beats
m_ex_volume_05_8,"that are impactful and touch your heart are imperative,"
m_ex_volume_05_9,"but as a rapper,"
m_ex_volume_05_10,it's all about DICTION!
m_ex_volume_05_11,"Personally, I think vocalization and intonation"
m_ex_volume_05_12,are the most important parts.
m_ex_volume_05_13,"In a way, your body is like a musical instrument."
m_ex_volume_05_14,Are you following me so far?
m_ex_volume_05_15,Yep.
m_ex_volume_05_16,Gotcha!
m_ex_volume_05_17,C'mon!
m_ex_volume_05_18,"If you're gonna be my manager,"
m_ex_volume_05_19,you've gotta respond in style.
m_ex_volume_05_20,Very nice!
m_ex_volume_05_21,Your responses are much cooler than before.
m_ex_volume_05_22,"I'm sure Noise and Aria do the same thing,"
m_ex_volume_05_23,and view their bodies as musical instruments.
m_ex_volume_05_24,"Most likely, because they're both singers."
m_ex_volume_05_25,However!
m_ex_volume_05_26,Even a lone instrument without any accompanying music
m_ex_volume_05_27,can express a full range of emotions.
m_ex_volume_05_28,Like a solo musician?
m_ex_volume_05_29,Precisely!
m_ex_volume_05_30,"Even for a soloist,"
m_ex_volume_05_31,"whether they're performing with a piano or violin,"
m_ex_volume_05_32,the finest performers
m_ex_volume_05_33,can make you feel overwhelmed with emotion
m_ex_volume_05_34,all at the same time.
m_ex_volume_05_35,"Right, right."
m_ex_volume_05_36,"If a rapper like me, especially one at the top of their career,"
m_ex_volume_05_37,"could also play an instrument,"
m_ex_volume_05_38,it'd be perfect!
m_ex_volume_05_39,It couldn't be any more perfect!
m_ex_volume_05_40,"With that being said,"
m_ex_volume_05_41,which instrument do you think I should learn?
m_ex_volume_05_42,The trumpet.
m_ex_volume_05_43,The flute.
m_ex_volume_05_44,Nooooooo!!
m_ex_volume_05_45,Manager.
m_ex_volume_05_46,"You want me, a rapper, to use an instrument that would block my mouth?"
m_ex_volume_05_47,Have you gone insane in the membrane?
m_ex_volume_05_48,Then what about beatboxing?
m_ex_volume_05_49,What?
m_ex_volume_05_50,Beatboxing?
m_ex_volume_05_51,I can already do that to some degree.
m_ex_volume_05_52,It'd never hurt to get better at it.
m_ex_volume_05_53,Hmm...
m_ex_volume_05_54,Let me see...
m_ex_volume_05_55,"Rather than learning one instrument,"
m_ex_volume_05_56,it would be more appropriate for me to utilize a skill
m_ex_volume_05_57,where I can mimic the sounds of all sorts of instruments.
m_ex_volume_05_58,You can take this chance to master it.
m_ex_volume_05_59,All right!
m_ex_volume_05_60,"Who knows, if we're lucky,"
m_ex_volume_05_61,we could end up making something that we could put on the next album.
m_ex_volume_05_62,I'm sure your fans would love that.
m_ex_volume_05_63,This is brilliant!
m_ex_volume_05_64,"Also,"
m_ex_volume_05_65,"I've been thinking that Honey sounds better than Manager,"
m_ex_volume_05_66,"so thanks, Honey!"
m_ex_volume_06_1,"Hi, Honey."
m_ex_volume_06_2,"Hello, Volume."
m_ex_volume_06_3,Hi babe.
m_ex_volume_06_4,??
m_ex_volume_06_5,Manager.
m_ex_volume_06_6,What's going on here?
m_ex_volume_06_7,Do you want to get yourself fired?
m_ex_volume_06_8,"... Hi, babe."
m_ex_volume_06_9,Yes!
m_ex_volume_06_10,That's better.
m_ex_volume_06_11,Wow!
m_ex_volume_06_12,I love it!
m_ex_volume_06_13,Call me that every day.
m_ex_volume_06_14,What's up?
m_ex_volume_06_15,I have a favor
m_ex_volume_06_16,to ask of you.
m_ex_volume_06_17,Are you any good at singing?
m_ex_volume_06_18,I was thinking of potentially doing a collab with you on my next song.
m_ex_volume_06_19,??
m_ex_volume_06_20,What's the matter?
m_ex_volume_06_21,That's not going to work.
m_ex_volume_06_22,Why not?
m_ex_volume_06_23,I heard that you go to karaoke all the time.
m_ex_volume_06_24,I would think that'd mean you're at least okay at singing.
m_ex_volume_06_25,That's because I'm being dragged there against my will...
m_ex_volume_06_26,"Oh c'mon, don't be shy."
m_ex_volume_06_27,Rather than express your passion for singing
m_ex_volume_06_28,"in front of a machine,"
m_ex_volume_06_29,wouldn't it be better
m_ex_volume_06_30,to show it in front of an audience?
m_ex_volume_06_31,You know?
m_ex_volume_06_32,I don't think I'm good enough to showcase my singing to the public.
m_ex_volume_06_33,Hmm...
m_ex_volume_06_34,"If that's what you're so worried about,"
m_ex_volume_06_35,let me listen to it.
m_ex_volume_06_36,We can go to karaoke together.
m_ex_volume_06_37,Are you free later today?
m_ex_volume_06_38,Er...
m_ex_volume_06_39,What is it?
m_ex_volume_06_40,"Actually, I already promised to go with Diesel."
m_ex_volume_06_41,?!
m_ex_volume_06_42,Then what about tomorrow?
m_ex_volume_06_43,Tomorrow I'm going with Aria.
m_ex_volume_06_44,Good grief!
m_ex_volume_06_45,"You've been excluding me this whole time,"
m_ex_volume_06_46,having the time of your life with karaoke?
m_ex_volume_06_47,I can't believe it!
m_ex_volume_06_48,"I told you, I'm being dragged there involuntarily."
m_ex_volume_06_49,"I know Aria has some serious pipes,"
m_ex_volume_06_50,but what about Diesel?
m_ex_volume_06_51,Is she a good singer?
m_ex_volume_06_52,She's spectacular.
m_ex_volume_06_53,Really?
m_ex_volume_06_54,I didn't expect that.
m_ex_volume_06_55,"Surely if she was that good, I would have heard about it."
m_ex_volume_06_56,I've never heard her sing.
m_ex_volume_06_57,You'd be surprised.
m_ex_volume_06_58,Hmm...
m_ex_volume_06_59,"So she's a hidden talent, is that it?"
m_ex_volume_06_60,She's no prodigy...
m_ex_volume_06_61,Very well!
m_ex_volume_06_62,Tell Diesel that
m_ex_volume_06_63,I'm coming along as well.
m_ex_volume_06_64,I feel like something terrible is going to happen.
m_ex_absolut_03_1,"Hello, everyone,"
m_ex_absolut_03_2,do you have a moment?
m_ex_absolut_03_3,"Sure, I have time."
m_ex_absolut_03_4,I'm free as well.
m_ex_absolut_03_5,Hey.
m_ex_absolut_03_6,How many times do I have to tell you not to use Bla
m_ex_absolut_03_7,if it isn't important?
m_ex_absolut_03_8,But it is important!
m_ex_absolut_03_9,That's why I messaged.
m_ex_absolut_03_10,...
m_ex_absolut_03_11,"Come now, ladies."
m_ex_absolut_03_12,"The Commander is watching,"
m_ex_absolut_03_13,so don't fight.
m_ex_absolut_03_14,Whatever.
m_ex_absolut_03_15,Out with it.
m_ex_absolut_03_16,"Unlike these two morons, I'm busy."
m_ex_absolut_03_17,"What is it, Vesti?"
m_ex_absolut_03_18,Hmmm...
m_ex_absolut_03_19,I just got back
m_ex_absolut_03_20,from seeing Ingrid.
m_ex_absolut_03_21,"When I saw her,"
m_ex_absolut_03_22,she was sitting with her eyes closed and sighing.
m_ex_absolut_03_23,Really?
m_ex_absolut_03_24,"She looked exhausted,"
m_ex_absolut_03_25,"and I didn't know what to say,"
m_ex_absolut_03_26,so I quietly snuck out.
m_ex_absolut_03_27,"It's the first time I've seen her like that,"
m_ex_absolut_03_28,"so I'm a little worried, that's all."
m_ex_absolut_03_29,That doesn't sound like her at all.
m_ex_absolut_03_30,Exactly.
m_ex_absolut_03_31,So I was thinking that
m_ex_absolut_03_32,we could maybe get her a gift of some kind.
m_ex_absolut_03_33,"Y'know,"
m_ex_absolut_03_34,to help her lighten up a bit.
m_ex_absolut_03_35,Oh my!
m_ex_absolut_03_36,That's a great idea.
m_ex_absolut_03_37,I've already got something in mind.
m_ex_absolut_03_38,!!
m_ex_absolut_03_39,Already?
m_ex_absolut_03_40,??
m_ex_absolut_03_41,You know what I excel at.
m_ex_absolut_03_42,You don't mean...
m_ex_absolut_03_43,I'm going to utilize all of my skills
m_ex_absolut_03_44,and make her a splendid chocolate cake!
m_ex_absolut_03_45,There's nothing like something sweet as a pick-me-up when you're tired.
m_ex_absolut_03_46,What do you think?
m_ex_absolut_03_47,Um...
m_ex_absolut_03_48,That's more a curse than a gift.
m_ex_absolut_03_49,There's nothing more annoying than having to deal with leftovers.
m_ex_absolut_03_50,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_03_51,"I was planning on making one for you too, Eunhwa."
m_ex_absolut_03_52,A two-level tiered cake!
m_ex_absolut_03_53,... Ugh.
m_ex_absolut_03_54,"Did you have anything in mind, Vesti?"
m_ex_absolut_03_55,!!
m_ex_absolut_03_56,I'm still thinking.
m_ex_absolut_03_57,I don't really know
m_ex_absolut_03_58,what the boss is into.
m_ex_absolut_03_59,"Do you have any ideas,"
m_ex_absolut_03_60,Commander?
m_ex_absolut_03_61,A fancy-patterned scarf.
m_ex_absolut_03_62,An anti-aging skincare set.
m_ex_absolut_03_63,"Hmm,"
m_ex_absolut_03_64,you might want to be careful with that.
m_ex_absolut_03_65,That seems like
m_ex_absolut_03_66,it might be meant for someone older.
m_ex_absolut_03_67,"Yeah,"
m_ex_absolut_03_68,I actually think
m_ex_absolut_03_69,Emma is right on this one.
m_ex_absolut_03_70,Are you all
m_ex_absolut_03_71,deaf and blind?
m_ex_absolut_03_72,What?
m_ex_absolut_03_73,Just listen to Ingrid's voice and see how she moves.
m_ex_absolut_03_74,"Not to mention her wrinkles,"
m_ex_absolut_03_75,which are always a tell-tale sign.
m_ex_absolut_03_76,"It's clear that she's no spring chicken,"
m_ex_absolut_03_77,and she's absolutely in the right age range for those gifts.
m_ex_absolut_03_78,Oh dear...
m_ex_absolut_03_79,!!
m_ex_absolut_03_80,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_03_81,You've all been hanging around Weakling too much.
m_ex_absolut_03_82,His stupidity is rubbing off on you.
m_ex_absolut_03_83,"Your observation skills are vital in combat,"
m_ex_absolut_03_84,so make sure that you don't allow them to deteriorate.
m_ex_absolut_03_85,"Eunhwa,"
m_ex_absolut_03_86,where are you right now?
m_ex_absolut_03_87,Why do you ask?
m_ex_absolut_03_88,The boss is asking for you.
m_ex_absolut_03_89,!!
m_ex_absolut_03_90,"Actually,"
m_ex_absolut_03_91,she's been looking over my shoulder
m_ex_absolut_03_92,this entire time.
m_ex_absolut_03_93,She says she wants to have a talk with you
m_ex_absolut_03_94,"about your ""observation"" skills."
m_ex_absolut_03_95,"She wants you in her office, on the double."
m_ex_absolut_03_96,"Well, now that I've relayed the message, I'm gonna go!"
m_ex_absolut_03_97,Wha...
m_ex_absolut_03_98,"Oh, and Vesti."
m_ex_absolut_03_99,Ingrid says that she doesn't need any gifts.
m_ex_absolut_03_100,She really appreciates the thought though.
m_ex_absolut_03_101,"She told us we could have the day off,"
m_ex_absolut_03_102,so would you like to go see a movie?
m_ex_absolut_03_103,Yahoo!
m_ex_absolut_03_104,This is great!
m_ex_absolut_03_105,"Commander, you should come too."
m_ex_absolut_03_106,Count me in.
m_ex_absolut_03_107,...
m_ex_absolut_03_108,I'll send everyone a pin of the location.
m_ex_absolut_03_109,"As for you, Eunhwa,"
m_ex_absolut_03_110,I hope your meeting with the boss goes well.
m_ex_absolut_04_1,Return Report
m_ex_absolut_04_2,All three members of Absolute Squad present and accounted for.
m_ex_absolut_04_3,Surface operation completed.
m_ex_absolut_04_4,Deviation from predicted completion time.
m_ex_absolut_04_5,21 minutes and 2 seconds.
m_ex_absolut_04_6,Early completion.
m_ex_absolut_04_7,Returning now.
m_ex_absolut_04_8,Well done. Any injuries sustained?
m_ex_absolut_04_9,Who do you think you're talking to?
m_ex_absolut_04_10,"Don't make a fuss over a little tussle like this,"
m_ex_absolut_04_11,Weakling.
m_ex_absolut_04_12,"I heard it was far more than that, and was a serious skirmish."
m_ex_absolut_04_13,"Eunhwa,"
m_ex_absolut_04_14,"the Commander is just worried about you, that's all."
m_ex_absolut_04_15,You don't have to be so mean.
m_ex_absolut_04_16,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_04_17,"Don't worry, I'm used to her being cranky."
m_ex_absolut_04_18,...
m_ex_absolut_04_19,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_04_20,:D
m_ex_absolut_04_21,"There were an awful lot of Raptures this time around,"
m_ex_absolut_04_22,don't you think?
m_ex_absolut_04_23,"Yeah, totally."
m_ex_absolut_04_24,"There were more than last time,"
m_ex_absolut_04_25,but nothing out of the ordinary.
m_ex_absolut_04_26,"Vesti, impressive as always."
m_ex_absolut_04_27,Wha... I didn't mean to brag...
m_ex_absolut_04_28,It's okay.
m_ex_absolut_04_29,Your actions speak for themselves.
m_ex_absolut_04_30,"You landed headshot after headshot today,"
m_ex_absolut_04_31,even on several Lord-class Raptures.
m_ex_absolut_04_32,"The moment they popped their heads out, you took them out."
m_ex_absolut_04_33,I was surprised myself.
m_ex_absolut_04_34,I don't know how we'd fight without you.
m_ex_absolut_04_35,"Oh,"
m_ex_absolut_04_36,well...
m_ex_absolut_04_37,that's only because I've got you as backup.
m_ex_absolut_04_38,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_04_39,"Don't thank me, thank Eunhwa for her meticulous plan."
m_ex_absolut_04_40,It worked perfectly.
m_ex_absolut_04_41,Yes!
m_ex_absolut_04_42,You're both amazing.
m_ex_absolut_04_43,Bah.
m_ex_absolut_04_44,Save your flattery for Weakling.
m_ex_absolut_04_45,:/
m_ex_absolut_04_46,But I mean it...
m_ex_absolut_04_47,You saved me and Emma multiple times
m_ex_absolut_04_48,with your long-range sniping.
m_ex_absolut_04_49,"All right, Weakling,"
m_ex_absolut_04_50,what's our next course of action?
m_ex_absolut_04_51,"Aw, you really are shy, Eunhwa."
m_ex_absolut_04_52,Look at you changing the subject because you're embarrassed.
m_ex_absolut_04_53,I think I know why you're all considered the best.
m_ex_absolut_04_54,"Oh my, really?"
m_ex_absolut_04_55,Why do you think that is?
m_ex_absolut_04_56,Because you all care for each other.
m_ex_absolut_04_57,Because you're all so strong as individuals.
m_ex_absolut_04_58,:0
m_ex_absolut_04_59,I think so too!
m_ex_absolut_04_60,"Hehe, you're right."
m_ex_absolut_04_61,We're well aware of each other's strengths and weaknesses.
m_ex_absolut_04_62,Bah.
m_ex_absolut_04_63,You're being naïve.
m_ex_absolut_04_64,"If our individual abilities were strong,"
m_ex_absolut_04_65,we wouldn't need any support in the first place.
m_ex_absolut_04_66,That means that we have plenty of room for improvement.
m_ex_absolut_04_67,Is that so?
m_ex_absolut_04_68,Hmm... maybe.
m_ex_absolut_04_69,"If I had gone in there alone,"
m_ex_absolut_04_70,I don't think
m_ex_absolut_04_71,I would have come back.
m_ex_absolut_04_72,"Weakling,"
m_ex_absolut_04_73,do you even have eyes on your head?
m_ex_absolut_04_74,"We still have a long way to go as a team, let alone our individual abilities."
m_ex_absolut_04_75,"It may be hard to hear, but that's how it is."
m_ex_absolut_04_76,I disagree. I think Absolute is already amazing as is.
m_ex_absolut_04_77,:0
m_ex_absolut_04_78,"Wow, really?"
m_ex_absolut_04_79,Looking forward to you all impressing me even more in the future.
m_ex_absolut_04_80,Of course.
m_ex_absolut_04_81,We don't need your approval. We'll do our job commendably regardless.
m_ex_absolut_04_82,Naturally.
m_ex_absolut_04_83,That concludes our return report.
m_ex_absolut_04_84,Get some rest.
m_ex_absolut_04_85,We will.
m_ex_absolut_04_86,"Same to you, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_05_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_absolut_05_2,are you free right now?
m_ex_absolut_05_3,Sure. What's going on?
m_ex_absolut_05_4,I wanted to consult with you
m_ex_absolut_05_5,about something related to Eunhwa and Vesti.
m_ex_absolut_05_6,Emma.
m_ex_absolut_05_7,This is the group chat.
m_ex_absolut_05_8,Eunhwa and I can see your messages.
m_ex_absolut_05_9,I know.
m_ex_absolut_05_10,...
m_ex_absolut_05_11,You're talking about us behind our backs... in front of us?
m_ex_absolut_05_12,What's gotten into you?
m_ex_absolut_05_13,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_05_14,"Well, it's not so much me asking for advice, but giving a warning."
m_ex_absolut_05_15,A warning?
m_ex_absolut_05_16,What is going on?
m_ex_absolut_05_17,"Commander, listen to this."
m_ex_absolut_05_18,Eunhwa and Vesti both are
m_ex_absolut_05_19,only eating MRE meals!
m_ex_absolut_05_20,"I understand that we often don't have a choice during missions,"
m_ex_absolut_05_21,"but eating them all the time can't be good for you,"
m_ex_absolut_05_22,can it?
m_ex_absolut_05_23,!!
m_ex_absolut_05_24,...
m_ex_absolut_05_25,But...
m_ex_absolut_05_26,"all you've got to do is microwave them for a few minutes,"
m_ex_absolut_05_27,and you've got a delicious meal ready to go.
m_ex_absolut_05_28,Exactly.
m_ex_absolut_05_29,"It's convenient and delicious, so what's the problem?"
m_ex_absolut_05_30,I've heard that
m_ex_absolut_05_31,eating too many of them can lead to a nutritional imbalance.
m_ex_absolut_05_32,"Keeping our bodies in tip-top shape is part of our duty as well,"
m_ex_absolut_05_33,don't you remember?
m_ex_absolut_05_34,I think Emma is right.
m_ex_absolut_05_35,Weakling!
m_ex_absolut_05_36,Commander!!
m_ex_absolut_05_37,Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_05_38,"I knew you'd understand,"
m_ex_absolut_05_39,Commander.
m_ex_absolut_05_40,"With that being said,"
m_ex_absolut_05_41,"to help our team recover physically,"
m_ex_absolut_05_42,"I'm whipping up a nice, nutritious meal"
m_ex_absolut_05_43,for you all!
m_ex_absolut_05_44,"You're the best, Emma."
m_ex_absolut_05_45,"... Good luck, you two."
m_ex_absolut_05_46,What the...?!
m_ex_absolut_05_47,Weakling!
m_ex_absolut_05_48,:'(
m_ex_absolut_05_49,Commander...
m_ex_absolut_05_50,"All right then,"
m_ex_absolut_05_51,when would you all like to eat?
m_ex_absolut_05_52,Hold on.
m_ex_absolut_05_53,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_absolut_05_54,"haven't you been working an awful lot lately, Weakling?"
m_ex_absolut_05_55,!!
m_ex_absolut_05_56,"In fact, you've been so busy that you often haven't had time to eat."
m_ex_absolut_05_57,That one Nikke who is obsessed with soda was worried about you.
m_ex_absolut_05_58,Are you sure you've been eating a balanced diet?
m_ex_absolut_05_59,"Oh my goodness, is this true?"
m_ex_absolut_05_60,"Yeah, I heard about that as well."
m_ex_absolut_05_61,"Vesti, how could you?"
m_ex_absolut_05_62,Emma.
m_ex_absolut_05_63,"Rather than us,"
m_ex_absolut_05_64,I think he's the one you should be worried about.
m_ex_absolut_05_65,I think you're right.
m_ex_absolut_05_66,"I'm sorry, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_05_67,It was thoughtless of me to ignore you.
m_ex_absolut_05_68,I'll make something for you straight away.
m_ex_absolut_05_69,"No, I'm okay, really!"
m_ex_absolut_05_70,She's headed off to the Commander's Room with a hodgepodge of ingredients.
m_ex_absolut_05_71,Be sure to eat every last bite.
m_ex_absolut_05_72,"Sorry, Commander..."
m_ex_absolut_05_73,"I've got to get out of here, fast."
m_ex_external_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_external_03_2,I'm going to start our meeting as usual.
m_ex_external_03_3,"Wait, what meeting?"
m_ex_external_03_4,You mean you don't know?
m_ex_external_03_5,"Partner,"
m_ex_external_03_6,it seems you've been living under a rock all this time.
m_ex_external_03_7,I thought you knew about it.
m_ex_external_03_8,It was thoughtless of me to assume.
m_ex_external_03_9,"Before we start the meeting,"
m_ex_external_03_10,allow me to explain.
m_ex_external_03_11,Please.
m_ex_external_03_12,Extrinsic is a special forces unit
m_ex_external_03_13,which operates behind the scenes.
m_ex_external_03_14,"Due to the nature of our missions, we often have to make judgments."
m_ex_external_03_15,"Regardless of whether we are operating in the Ark or the Outpost,"
m_ex_external_03_16,"we are always objective and impartial in our verdicts when judging someone,"
m_ex_external_03_17,be they individual Nikkes or an entire squad.
m_ex_external_03_18,Do you have any questions
m_ex_external_03_19,at this point?
m_ex_external_03_20,I do!
m_ex_external_03_21,For the One-Winged Dark Lord has a question.
m_ex_external_03_22,I didn't ask you.
m_ex_external_03_23,"This exterior world is always made stronger by I,"
m_ex_external_03_24,Guillotine de Mephisto.
m_ex_external_03_25,...
m_ex_external_03_26,I don't have any questions. Keep going.
m_ex_external_03_27,Very well.
m_ex_external_03_28,Sharing the results of our respective analyses
m_ex_external_03_29,"can be beneficial for all of us,"
m_ex_external_03_30,so that is why we are using Bla
m_ex_external_03_31,to hold recurring meetings.
m_ex_external_03_32,Wouldn't meeting in person be preferable?
m_ex_external_03_33,"That may be true,"
m_ex_external_03_34,but to meet in person would present several...
m_ex_external_03_35,Umm...
m_ex_external_03_36,"Shall we say, challenges."
m_ex_external_03_37,I know what you mean.
m_ex_external_03_38,I knew you would understand.
m_ex_external_03_39,Hehe...
m_ex_external_03_40,It is not easy to welcome the devil into your life.
m_ex_external_03_41,...
m_ex_external_03_42,What's the topic for today's meeting?
m_ex_external_03_43,We are to analyze two squads
m_ex_external_03_44,which are currently performing at a high level.
m_ex_external_03_45,"First up, we have the Counters."
m_ex_external_03_46,I feel quite nervous all of a sudden...
m_ex_external_03_47,They're far more balanced than they seem at first glance.
m_ex_external_03_48,Anis sometimes loses her composure
m_ex_external_03_49,"due to the antics of Neon, the firepower enthusiast,"
m_ex_external_03_50,which can get them into some dangerous situations.
m_ex_external_03_51,"However, Rapi is a calming factor who always inspects her surroundings,"
m_ex_external_03_52,so they always complete their mission without any major issues.
m_ex_external_03_53,"Therefore, you could say that the team is a well-balanced machine."
m_ex_external_03_54,I'd say that's an accurate assessment.
m_ex_external_03_55,Hmm...
m_ex_external_03_56,This is all rather unexpected.
m_ex_external_03_57,I thought they were total newbies.
m_ex_external_03_58,"However, Partner and the Counters seem to be a good match for each other."
m_ex_external_03_59,We truly are.
m_ex_external_03_60,Next: Absolute.
m_ex_external_03_61,This team has a reputation for being the best of the best.
m_ex_external_03_62,They excel in nearly every category:
m_ex_external_03_63,"speed, combat readiness, and operational capabilities."
m_ex_external_03_64,Indeed.
m_ex_external_03_65,They are like the mighty Cerebus
m_ex_external_03_66,which guards the underworld.
m_ex_external_03_67,Especially that little one who dwells behind the wall.
m_ex_external_03_68,"Whenever I look upon her,"
m_ex_external_03_69,the One-Winged Dark Lord
m_ex_external_03_70,"which is sealed in my right eye goes berserk,"
m_ex_external_03_71,"craving for a battle,"
m_ex_external_03_72,just once.
m_ex_external_03_73,Are you talking about Vesti?
m_ex_external_03_74,I'm impressed that you're able to follow her gibberish.
m_ex_external_03_75,I think I'm getting the hang of it.
m_ex_external_03_76,"Well, not me."
m_ex_external_03_77,"I can barely understand her still,"
m_ex_external_03_78,and I have no intention of going out of my way to try and make sense of it.
m_ex_external_03_79,Do you at least respect her analysis?
m_ex_external_03_80,Why do you ask?
m_ex_external_03_81,Because I don't think you do.
m_ex_external_03_82,Hmm...
m_ex_external_03_83,Guillotine's analyses are objective and accurate.
m_ex_external_03_84,"However, her figures of speech can be quite exasperating,"
m_ex_external_03_85,which leaves me reluctant to include her in the meetings.
m_ex_external_03_86,You two are quite good together.
m_ex_external_03_87,!!
m_ex_external_03_88,I don't think...
m_ex_external_03_89,Red Rose.
m_ex_external_03_90,What are you hiding from the One-Winged Dark Lord?
m_ex_external_03_91,"Cast away that false persona,"
m_ex_external_03_92,cleanse yourself of denial and accept me!
m_ex_external_03_93,You see what I have to deal with?
m_ex_external_03_94,I hope your friendship lasts forever.
m_ex_external_03_95,"Just as the flames consume the battlefield, bound by the souls of the damned,"
m_ex_external_03_96,so will the Kotodama protect us.
m_ex_external_03_97,"On this day, the One-Winged Dark Lord will once again"
m_ex_external_03_98,head into battle for one last hurrah up on the surface.
m_ex_external_03_99,Ugh.
m_ex_external_03_100,I can't take much more of this...
m_ex_external_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_external_04_2,Extrinsic is going to be disbanded as of today.
m_ex_external_04_3,Did Guillotine do something?
m_ex_external_04_4,Is this a practical joke?
m_ex_external_04_5,No.
m_ex_external_04_6,Then Guillotine must have done something.
m_ex_external_04_7,"Red Rose,"
m_ex_external_04_8,did you become enchanted by the darkness?
m_ex_external_04_9,How can you renege on a blood pact?
m_ex_external_04_10,It would seem you are not afraid of
m_ex_external_04_11,the impending reprisal of the Dark Lord.
m_ex_external_04_12,I feel like I know the reason why you're disbanding the squad.
m_ex_external_04_13,That's right.
m_ex_external_04_14,I can't take it anymore.
m_ex_external_04_15,What was the inciting incident?
m_ex_external_04_16,Hmm...
m_ex_external_04_17,"After completing an operation recently,"
m_ex_external_04_18,I was going to do something I hadn't done in a while;
m_ex_external_04_19,have dinner with Guillotine.
m_ex_external_04_20,Why is that?
m_ex_external_04_21,Well...
m_ex_external_04_22,Er...
m_ex_external_04_23,...
m_ex_external_04_24,Is it not easy to say?
m_ex_external_04_25,...
m_ex_external_04_26,She allowed me to borrow some of Extrinsic's funds
m_ex_external_04_27,to buy a limited-edition costume.
m_ex_external_04_28,"I was quite grateful to her for that,"
m_ex_external_04_29,so I said I would treat her to dinner.
m_ex_external_04_30,As you should.
m_ex_external_04_31,"So,"
m_ex_external_04_32,"I went to that restaurant with good intentions,"
m_ex_external_04_33,and we arrived in high spirits.
m_ex_external_04_34,However...
m_ex_external_04_35,Haha!
m_ex_external_04_36,The material things predetermined by the world
m_ex_external_04_37,are of no use to the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_external_04_38,It's all because of her.
m_ex_external_04_39,She ruined everything.
m_ex_external_04_40,She kept demanding a salad with helmet flowers
m_ex_external_04_41,that wasn't even on the menu.
m_ex_external_04_42,Aren't those poisonous?
m_ex_external_04_43,Exactly!
m_ex_external_04_44,"Once our food was served,"
m_ex_external_04_45,she guffawed
m_ex_external_04_46,and said that she could hear the groans of untold sacrifices in the air.
m_ex_external_04_47,Hahahah!!
m_ex_external_04_48,Even the memory of that moment
m_ex_external_04_49,is enough to make the One-Winged Dark Lord strain at its chains and be on the brink of another rampage.
m_ex_external_04_50,:'(
m_ex_external_04_51,All the other people dining there
m_ex_external_04_52,started staring and whispering about us.
m_ex_external_04_53,Even the employees avoided coming to our table.
m_ex_external_04_54,It must have been quite embarrassing.
m_ex_external_04_55,Extremely.
m_ex_external_04_56,They eventually
m_ex_external_04_57,asked us to leave
m_ex_external_04_58,because we were disturbing the other diners.
m_ex_external_04_59,Oh my goodness.
m_ex_external_04_60,Hmph.
m_ex_external_04_61,It seems that
m_ex_external_04_62,the Guardian of Balance
m_ex_external_04_63,does not resonate with ordinary people.
m_ex_external_04_64,"Indeed, those who harbor the One-Winged Dark Lord within them"
m_ex_external_04_65,are forsaken to a lonely fate wherever they may travel.
m_ex_external_04_66,"At this rate,"
m_ex_external_04_67,it's getting almost impossible to keep the team running.
m_ex_external_04_68,"When even something as simple as dining out becomes an ordeal,"
m_ex_external_04_69,I think it's best we just go our separate ways.
m_ex_external_04_70,Haha.
m_ex_external_04_71,You dare try to bow out of a pact
m_ex_external_04_72,with Guillotine de Mephisto
m_ex_external_04_73,for such minute reasons?
m_ex_external_04_74,Purification is indeed necessary.
m_ex_external_04_75,"Next time, just order something that's on the menu."
m_ex_external_04_76,"Partner,"
m_ex_external_04_77,are you trying to confine the One-Winged Dark Lord
m_ex_external_04_78,within the regulations dictated by this world?
m_ex_external_04_79,How foolish you are.
m_ex_external_04_80,"If you keep it up, Maiden is going to leave you."
m_ex_external_04_81,"If you keep it up, I'm going to report you to Ingrid."
m_ex_external_04_82,...
m_ex_external_04_83,Surely you jest.
m_ex_external_04_84,I'm not joking.
m_ex_external_04_85,Very well.
m_ex_external_04_86,You leave me no choice.
m_ex_external_04_87,Perhaps this is also destiny.
m_ex_external_04_88,"Sometimes, lowering oneself into the dregs"
m_ex_external_04_89,with such foolish individuals
m_ex_external_04_90,is part of the solitary fate of those who harbor the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_external_04_91,This is one fight I must abandon.
m_ex_external_04_92,"I think we've managed to resolve everything, Maiden."
m_ex_external_04_93,...
m_ex_external_04_94,I guess it'll be fine for a while.
m_ex_external_04_95,"Thanks, Commander."
m_ex_external_05_1,"Partner,"
m_ex_external_05_2,I think the time for judgment has come.
m_ex_external_05_3,??
m_ex_external_05_4,"Guillotine,"
m_ex_external_05_5,this isn't a courtroom.
m_ex_external_05_6,No one here
m_ex_external_05_7,needs your judgment.
m_ex_external_05_8,Haha!
m_ex_external_05_9,The One-Winged Dark Lord does not make mistakes.
m_ex_external_05_10,The one who will receive judgment tonight
m_ex_external_05_11,is Red Rose.
m_ex_external_05_12,"Yes, Maiden, you!"
m_ex_external_05_13,...
m_ex_external_05_14,I can't take much more of this.
m_ex_external_05_15,Don't worry about it.
m_ex_external_05_16,"You must endure, for that is the destiny of the Red Rose."
m_ex_external_05_17,That's easy for you to say.
m_ex_external_05_18,You don't have to deal with her ramblings day in and day out.
m_ex_external_05_19,"Not you too,"
m_ex_external_05_20,Commander!
m_ex_external_05_21,What's gotten into Guillotine this time?
m_ex_external_05_22,Beats me.
m_ex_external_05_23,What did I do to deserve this?
m_ex_external_05_24,"If your memory fails you,"
m_ex_external_05_25,allow me to refresh it for you.
m_ex_external_05_26,"That day, the fog was unusually thick."
m_ex_external_05_27,Not a single strand of light could penetrate its thick malaise.
m_ex_external_05_28,"An extraordinarily tranquil night,"
m_ex_external_05_29,as if not a single spark of life was left.
m_ex_external_05_30,That's when I heard it.
m_ex_external_05_31,The cries of a rose trapped in the dungeon.
m_ex_external_05_32,Are you saying you heard Maiden's voice?
m_ex_external_05_33,That's right.
m_ex_external_05_34,"At first, I thought my ears deceived me."
m_ex_external_05_35,"So horrific were the screeches,"
m_ex_external_05_36,that I tried to ignore it at first.
m_ex_external_05_37,Even the One-Winged Dark Lord in my right eye
m_ex_external_05_38,remained silent.
m_ex_external_05_39,What did you hear?
m_ex_external_05_40,That's it.
m_ex_external_05_41,I'm done
m_ex_external_05_42,with this conversation.
m_ex_external_05_43,I'm leaving.
m_ex_external_05_44,"Are you running away,"
m_ex_external_05_45,Corrupted Red Rose?
m_ex_external_05_46,Enough with the ridiculous nicknames!
m_ex_external_05_47,Were you dreaming?
m_ex_external_05_48,Haha.
m_ex_external_05_49,I would rather it be a dream.
m_ex_external_05_50,But I saw and heard it all too clearly.
m_ex_external_05_51,"Slipping through the darkness,"
m_ex_external_05_52,"covered in a blanket from head to toe,"
m_ex_external_05_53,"was she, the one and only corrupted rose."
m_ex_external_05_54,"Much like a disembodied voice,"
m_ex_external_05_55,floating in another world.
m_ex_external_05_56,!!
m_ex_external_05_57,You were playing a game!
m_ex_external_05_58,That's right.
m_ex_external_05_59,So deeply was she immersed in that world
m_ex_external_05_60,that she wasn't even aware that
m_ex_external_05_61,her own voice was
m_ex_external_05_62,disturbing the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_external_05_63,Did you record it by any chance?
m_ex_external_05_64,What are you talking about?!
m_ex_external_05_65,Partner.
m_ex_external_05_66,Of course I did.
m_ex_external_05_67,"If you come to my location, I shall let you hear it."
m_ex_external_05_68,Where are you? I'll come right away.
m_ex_external_05_69,"Where the crescent moon rises,"
m_ex_external_05_70,"where the shadow of the church steeple is visible,"
m_ex_external_05_71,you will find me and the One-Winged Dark Lord.
m_ex_external_05_72,Okay.
m_ex_external_05_73,No!
m_ex_external_05_74,Wait!
m_ex_external_05_75,I'm certain
m_ex_external_05_76,Guillotine is lying about the recording.
m_ex_external_05_77,She's just teasing me...
m_ex_external_05_78,aren't you?
m_ex_external_05_79,"""Ah, nice!"""
m_ex_external_05_80,"""Scarlet Peach Pie"""
m_ex_external_05_81,Argh!!
m_ex_external_05_82,"""I'll buff you right now"""
m_ex_external_05_83,"""Huh?"""
m_ex_external_05_84,Stop!
m_ex_external_05_85,"""Black Rose enchant!"""
m_ex_external_05_86,Maiden left the chat.
m_ex_external_05_87,"Partner,"
m_ex_external_05_88,"if you wish to hear the recording, it would be best if you hurry."
m_ex_external_05_89,The Red Rose's Kotodama
m_ex_external_05_90,is descending like the mist
m_ex_external_05_91,that falls in the rainy dawn.
m_ex_external_05_92,I'll be there soon.
m_ex_external_05_93,Haha!
m_ex_external_05_94,I wish you good luck.
m_ex_primadonna_03_1,How's everyone doing?
m_ex_primadonna_03_2,"Hi, guys."
m_ex_primadonna_03_3,Just resting.
m_ex_primadonna_03_4,What's up?
m_ex_primadonna_03_5,I've had something on my mind.
m_ex_primadonna_03_6,What's that?
m_ex_primadonna_03_7,Hmm...
m_ex_primadonna_03_8,I think I'm going through a slump.
m_ex_primadonna_03_9,Really?
m_ex_primadonna_03_10,Did something happen?
m_ex_primadonna_03_11,Well...
m_ex_primadonna_03_12,I don't seem to like any of the songs I've been working on.
m_ex_primadonna_03_13,"I've put a lot of effort into them, but they're all no good."
m_ex_primadonna_03_14,"Before,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_15,"I used to be able to finish a recording in just a few hours,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_16,"and when I was done, I was in love with it."
m_ex_primadonna_03_17,Oh no!
m_ex_primadonna_03_18,That doesn't seem like you at all.
m_ex_primadonna_03_19,You've toppled me from the top of the charts
m_ex_primadonna_03_20,too many times to count.
m_ex_primadonna_03_21,"Settle down, Volume."
m_ex_primadonna_03_22,You've gone through periods of doubt
m_ex_primadonna_03_23,just like this at least once before.
m_ex_primadonna_03_24,Yeah...
m_ex_primadonna_03_25,that's true.
m_ex_primadonna_03_26,Being an artist sounds tough.
m_ex_primadonna_03_27,How about you take a break?
m_ex_primadonna_03_28,Maybe you've overworked yourself.
m_ex_primadonna_03_29,Take a breather and take some time to recharge.
m_ex_primadonna_03_30,"Once you do that, I'm sure you'll be back to your old self again."
m_ex_primadonna_03_31,Hmm...
m_ex_primadonna_03_32,"I thought about that,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_33,"but I feel like the more I rest, the more my skills decline."
m_ex_primadonna_03_34,"If anything, I think that'd make the situation worse."
m_ex_primadonna_03_35,So that got me thinking.
m_ex_primadonna_03_36,Have you come up with something?
m_ex_primadonna_03_37,"Yeah, there is one thing."
m_ex_primadonna_03_38,How about I change the way that I practice?
m_ex_primadonna_03_39,What?
m_ex_primadonna_03_40,"Rather than resting,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_41,you're going to practice even more?
m_ex_primadonna_03_42,That's right.
m_ex_primadonna_03_43,"If I try a new approach,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_44,I might be able to make new discoveries
m_ex_primadonna_03_45,and find my voice once again.
m_ex_primadonna_03_46,That's a very Noise idea.
m_ex_primadonna_03_47,Is it?
m_ex_primadonna_03_48,Hearing you say that
m_ex_primadonna_03_49,fills me with confidence.
m_ex_primadonna_03_50,I say we all can offer our own ideas to Noise as well.
m_ex_primadonna_03_51,All right!
m_ex_primadonna_03_52,I think that's a great idea.
m_ex_primadonna_03_53,Okay!
m_ex_primadonna_03_54,Me first.
m_ex_primadonna_03_55,"At first, I hired the most expensive trainer around who was supposed to be the best,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_56,but he turned out to be garbage.
m_ex_primadonna_03_57,He claimed that my voice wasn't what was trending these days
m_ex_primadonna_03_58,and that I had to change everything.
m_ex_primadonna_03_59,So what'd you do?
m_ex_primadonna_03_60,I fired him!
m_ex_primadonna_03_61,No one knows better than me what I need to do.
m_ex_primadonna_03_62,And my fans love my voice!
m_ex_primadonna_03_63,So my training method is
m_ex_primadonna_03_64,to trust yourself.
m_ex_primadonna_03_65,"Mmm,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_66,trusting yourself is important.
m_ex_primadonna_03_67,"Very cool, Volume. What about you, Aria?"
m_ex_primadonna_03_68,"Whenever I practice,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_69,I imagine the day of the performance.
m_ex_primadonna_03_70,"A massive stage all lit up,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_71,"the stadium filled with an adoring crowd,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_72,"and me standing in the middle,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_73,with all eyes on me.
m_ex_primadonna_03_74,Wow...
m_ex_primadonna_03_75,If you use your imagination
m_ex_primadonna_03_76,"to make yourself feel like you're actually on stage,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_77,"then your focus increases,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_78,and you get a lot more out of practice.
m_ex_primadonna_03_79,So I can practice while imagining how the audience will receive it.
m_ex_primadonna_03_80,That's a great idea.
m_ex_primadonna_03_81,"For me, it has to do with karaoke."
m_ex_primadonna_03_82,"Oh, er..."
m_ex_primadonna_03_83,"that's okay, Producer."
m_ex_primadonna_03_84,You don't have to share your method with me.
m_ex_primadonna_03_85,The fact you comforted me earlier is already more than enough.
m_ex_primadonna_03_86,"No, I want to tell you."
m_ex_primadonna_03_87,"Actually, I really ought to start practicing."
m_ex_primadonna_03_88,"I feel like I'm in the groove,"
m_ex_primadonna_03_89,and I think I'll be able to get back to recording in no time!
m_ex_primadonna_03_90,That's my girl!
m_ex_primadonna_03_91,That's the spirit!
m_ex_primadonna_03_92,It's important just to try.
m_ex_primadonna_03_93,But I'm not finished...
m_ex_primadonna_03_94,"Thanks, everyone."
m_ex_primadonna_03_95,I better get going to start my practice now!
m_ex_primadonna_04_1,"Producer,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_2,I have a big problem.
m_ex_primadonna_04_3,What's wrong?
m_ex_primadonna_04_4,I just got a request to do an interview.
m_ex_primadonna_04_5,What's the problem with that?
m_ex_primadonna_04_6,Can't you just do it?
m_ex_primadonna_04_7,OMG.
m_ex_primadonna_04_8,Are you saying this in the group chat just to rub it in our faces?
m_ex_primadonna_04_9,Rude.
m_ex_primadonna_04_10,"No, it's not that."
m_ex_primadonna_04_11,They want to interview
m_ex_primadonna_04_12,all of Prima Donna.
m_ex_primadonna_04_13,What?
m_ex_primadonna_04_14,Tell me everything.
m_ex_primadonna_04_15,It's just as I said.
m_ex_primadonna_04_16,"We're all to gather together for an interview,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_17,but there won't actually be an interviewer.
m_ex_primadonna_04_18,"Apparently we're supposed to ask each other questions,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_19,since that's the popular thing to do these days.
m_ex_primadonna_04_20,Wow!
m_ex_primadonna_04_21,Then we can't miss out on this opportunity.
m_ex_primadonna_04_22,Sounds fun! I want to do it.
m_ex_primadonna_04_23,Something tells me it's going to be a bit of a challenge.
m_ex_primadonna_04_24,You're right.
m_ex_primadonna_04_25,There's no way
m_ex_primadonna_04_26,the three of us interviewing each other can go well.
m_ex_primadonna_04_27,Right...
m_ex_primadonna_04_28,I'd rather spend my time
m_ex_primadonna_04_29,putting in a bit more practice than dealing with all that.
m_ex_primadonna_04_30,What the...
m_ex_primadonna_04_31,You two are such wet blankets.
m_ex_primadonna_04_32,Connecting with your fans is just as important as practice!
m_ex_primadonna_04_33,I would think you'd know that by now.
m_ex_primadonna_04_34,I'm a wet blanket?
m_ex_primadonna_04_35,I've done plenty of things
m_ex_primadonna_04_36,to reach out and connect with my fans!
m_ex_primadonna_04_37,"Everyone, relax."
m_ex_primadonna_04_38,"Anyway,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_39,"I'm not interested in doing a group interview,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_40,so you guys can do it.
m_ex_primadonna_04_41,Same here.
m_ex_primadonna_04_42,"Volume,"
m_ex_primadonna_04_43,"if you're really that interested in it, you can do it with Producer."
m_ex_primadonna_04_44,Why me?
m_ex_primadonna_04_45,Umm...
m_ex_primadonna_04_46,So you're really not going to do the interview?
m_ex_primadonna_04_47,Nope.
m_ex_primadonna_04_48,Never.
m_ex_primadonna_04_49,Hmm...
m_ex_primadonna_05_1,"Hey,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_2,does anyone have a moment?
m_ex_primadonna_05_3,What's up?
m_ex_primadonna_05_4,I'm a little bit worried about
m_ex_primadonna_05_5,Aria and Noise.
m_ex_primadonna_05_6,You thinking about other people?
m_ex_primadonna_05_7,That's a first.
m_ex_primadonna_05_8,You're not going to bring up
m_ex_primadonna_05_9,"that group interview thing again,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_10,are you?
m_ex_primadonna_05_11,We already decided before that we weren't going to do it.
m_ex_primadonna_05_12,Is this the beginning of round two?
m_ex_primadonna_05_13,I say we let that matter drop.
m_ex_primadonna_05_14,Don't worry.
m_ex_primadonna_05_15,"It's okay, Manager."
m_ex_primadonna_05_16,I can feel some gray hairs coming on already.
m_ex_primadonna_05_17,"Come on,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_18,don't be like that.
m_ex_primadonna_05_19,"All right, listen up."
m_ex_primadonna_05_20,All of us in the Prima Donna squad
m_ex_primadonna_05_21,are famous celebrities
m_ex_primadonna_05_22,"who sell out every performance, right?"
m_ex_primadonna_05_23,You know what I'm saying!
m_ex_primadonna_05_24,Right.
m_ex_primadonna_05_25,Yeah.
m_ex_primadonna_05_26,Yup.
m_ex_primadonna_05_27,"The more famous we become, the more interview requests we'll get."
m_ex_primadonna_05_28,"Sure, we might be able to turn down a few of them,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_29,but we won't be able to avoid all of them.
m_ex_primadonna_05_30,Right?
m_ex_primadonna_05_31,Hmm...
m_ex_primadonna_05_32,Probably.
m_ex_primadonna_05_33,Our fans are the only reason
m_ex_primadonna_05_34,that we can do what we do.
m_ex_primadonna_05_35,I think answering some of the questions they want to know
m_ex_primadonna_05_36,is a way of reciprocating the love our fans give us.
m_ex_primadonna_05_37,That's the first sensible thing you've said in ages.
m_ex_primadonna_05_38,"Come on,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_39,don't ruin the moment.
m_ex_primadonna_05_40,"So what is it that you wanted to say, exactly?"
m_ex_primadonna_05_41,I'm just saying that
m_ex_primadonna_05_42,we should try sharing some information about us in the future.
m_ex_primadonna_05_43,Information?
m_ex_primadonna_05_44,What kind?
m_ex_primadonna_05_45,Like doing interviews!
m_ex_primadonna_05_46,"I think it's important, too."
m_ex_primadonna_05_47,"Hold on,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_48,didn't you have that one interview that was a nightmare?
m_ex_primadonna_05_49,Oh sure.
m_ex_primadonna_05_50,It was a total smear job that focused solely on my scandals.
m_ex_primadonna_05_51,You're nothing but scandals.
m_ex_primadonna_05_52,"Hey, watch it."
m_ex_primadonna_05_53,"Anyway, that person kept poking and prodding"
m_ex_primadonna_05_54,about my relationship with Manager.
m_ex_primadonna_05_55,What did you say?
m_ex_primadonna_05_56,You can tell them the truth.
m_ex_primadonna_05_57,I left it to their imagination.
m_ex_primadonna_05_58,That'll only create more room for misunderstanding.
m_ex_primadonna_05_59,What's there to misunderstand?
m_ex_primadonna_05_60,Of course I was honest.
m_ex_primadonna_05_61,I told him our relationship was... complicated.
m_ex_primadonna_05_62,That's hardly what I'd call honest.
m_ex_primadonna_05_63,Isn't it though? Would you call our relationship simple?
m_ex_primadonna_05_64,...
m_ex_primadonna_05_65,"Ah,"
m_ex_primadonna_05_66,I think I know who you're talking about.
m_ex_primadonna_05_67,He was very persistent with me too.
m_ex_primadonna_05_68,What an oaf.
m_ex_primadonna_05_69,"Watch out for him, Aria."
m_ex_primadonna_05_70,Okay.
m_ex_primadonna_05_71,It's good that we're sharing this information amongst each other.
m_ex_primadonna_05_72,How about we do this regularly from now on?
m_ex_primadonna_05_73,I don't know about that.
m_ex_primadonna_05_74,"Yeah, that might be a bit difficult for me too."
m_ex_primadonna_05_75,I don't want anything to cut into my practice time.
m_ex_primadonna_05_76,"Sorry, but I'm busy too."
m_ex_primadonna_05_77,"As far as sharing information goes, we'll have to make it a one-time thing."
m_ex_primadonna_05_78,I think a group interview is only bound to end in disaster.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_1,Message testing.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_2,??
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_3,Testing. Testing.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_4,D?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_5,1234567890
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_6,!@#%^&*()
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_7,"Letters, numbers, and special characters. All checked."
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_8,Test complete.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_9,Was it you who anonymously sent me this phone?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_10,Yes.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_11,I prepared it for this mission.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_12,I'll contact you through this number
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_13,while we're pretending to be newlyweds. Keep it safe.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_14,Got it.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_15,1.txt
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_16,What's this?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_17,I sorted out our characters' backstories.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_18,The password is my birthday.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_19,Downloading 1.txt.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_20,Download complete.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_21,I open the file to see a long block of text.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_22,Do I have to memorize it all?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_23,Of course.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_24,I'm sure it's a piece of cake for you.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_25,I try my best to memorize the backstory.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_26,I think I'm almost done.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_27,One more thing...
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_28,Shall we exchange texts like newlyweds?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_29,Just in case someone decides to snoop through our phones.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_30,Text like newlyweds...
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_31,Oh! I nearly forgot.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_32,"Could you do me a favor and erase all our previous messages,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_33,including this one?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_34,I'll tell you how to do it later.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_35,Okay.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_36,"So, let's start texting like newlyweds?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_38,Honey!
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_39,When will you be back today?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_40,We're already starting...?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_41,What?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_42,"What are you talking about, Honey?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_43,"Be sure to keep yourself on your toes, all right? :)"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_44,It's kinda strange hearing you call me Honey...
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_45,"Well,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_46,"that's because we just got married,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_47,so you're still not used to it.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_48,Uh...
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_49,But I still want to call you Honey.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_50,"Anyway,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_51,"I love the photo you took for me yesterday,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_52,so I used it as my profile picture.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_53,How does it look?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_54,It suits you.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_55,Thanks ❤
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_56,When will you be back anyway?
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_57,I miss you so bad.
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_58,"Got it, I'm heading out right now."
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_59,Come back soon!
m_ex_d_killerwife_01_60,... It may take quite a while to get the hang of talking like newlyweds.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_1,"What are you doing right now, Honey?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_2,Gaming.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_3,Gaming?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_4,What game?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_5,The last phase of the Raid has begun.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_6,"So, I'll get back to her later."
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_7,Honey!
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_8,Honey?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_9,Honeyyyyy?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_10,Honey!
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_11,{AccountData.NickName}!
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_12,My phone keeps beeping with notifications.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_13,Waitdf
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_14,^^
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_15,Im playing raid rn
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_16,"While typing with one hand, I fail to dodge the boss' skill."
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_17,"And just like that, my whole team has been wiped out."
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_18,Ah...
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_19,??
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_20,While I was texting you back
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_21,Wiped out?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_22,Yeah...
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_23,Honey.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_24,"Don't brush me off, okay?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_25,Are games more important than me?
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_26,"No, right?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_27,My hands start to get really sweaty.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_28,Answer my question.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_29,"Well, absolutely nothing's more important than you."
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_30,"Hehe, I knew it!"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_31,"OK,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_32,let's talk about it after you finish this round.
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_33,"It won't take long, right?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_34,"No, I'll be real quick."
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_35,But my mind starts to wander...
m_ex_d_killerwife_02_36,"In the end, I fail to clear the stage."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_1,"Honey,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_2,remember the social gatherings I mentioned?
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_3,"Yeah, what about them?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_4,There's one today.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_5,I just got back from it.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_6,How was it? Good?
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_7,No T_T
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_8,"I met a lot of new faces, and it was exhausting."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_9,You should've come with me.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_10,"Naw, you must be pooped."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_11,I tried to find an excuse to leave
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_12,the moment I arrived.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_13,"But, people suddenly started swarming around me."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_14,Seriously?
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_15,"Yeah,"
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_16,they asked me where you were.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_17,And kept asking about us.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_18,If we have any issues.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_19,If I got cheated on.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_20,I didn't even say a thing.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_21,But they started to speculate
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_22,and make up stories
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_23,that are totally ridiculous
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_24,as if they've met you before.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_25,Total crap.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_26,Just ignore them. Meddlers love to talk.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_27,I've had enough! I miss you so bad.
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_28,How am I supposed to ignore it
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_29,when I hear someone trash-talking you
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_30,right in front of my face? :/
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_31,D does not reply for a while...
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_32,"Sorry, I overreacted. This isn't like me."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_33,"I'm sorry, Honey."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_34,"No, thank you for being angry."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_35,"Anyway, I miss you so much."
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_36,"Be sure to come home right after work, okay?"
m_ex_d_killerwife_03_37,Will do.
m_ex_bay_01_1,"Nice to meet you,"
m_ex_bay_01_2,Coach.
m_ex_bay_01_3,"I'm Bay,"
m_ex_bay_01_4,the leader of the cheerleader team Rewind Squad.
m_ex_bay_01_5,"Hello, Bay."
m_ex_bay_01_6,"If it's okay,"
m_ex_bay_01_7,I have something
m_ex_bay_01_8,I want to ask you.
m_ex_bay_01_9,What is it?
m_ex_bay_01_10,Hmm...
m_ex_bay_01_11,You might think
m_ex_bay_01_12,"it's weird,"
m_ex_bay_01_13,so it's kind of hard to bring up...
m_ex_bay_01_14,"It's okay, tell me."
m_ex_bay_01_15,"Well,"
m_ex_bay_01_16,"when we're messaging over Blah,"
m_ex_bay_01_17,could you
m_ex_bay_01_18,try not to use
m_ex_bay_01_19,any face emojis?
m_ex_bay_01_20,Face emojis?
m_ex_bay_01_21,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_22,Like this :-) ?
m_ex_bay_01_23,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_24,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_25,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_26,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_27,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_28,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_29,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_30,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_31,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_32,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_33,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_34,??
m_ex_bay_01_35,Oh.
m_ex_bay_01_36,"Sorry,"
m_ex_bay_01_37,Coach.
m_ex_bay_01_38,"To tell you the truth,"
m_ex_bay_01_39,I have a fear of being looked at.
m_ex_bay_01_40,How so?
m_ex_bay_01_41,"Whenever I become the center of attention,"
m_ex_bay_01_42,I get super anxious
m_ex_bay_01_43,and short of breath.
m_ex_bay_01_44,Any specific kind of attention?
m_ex_bay_01_45,"Yeah,"
m_ex_bay_01_46,"from people, specifically."
m_ex_bay_01_47,And it affects you even over text messages?
m_ex_bay_01_48,That's right.
m_ex_bay_01_49,"I thought Bla would be okay,"
m_ex_bay_01_50,"but whenever I see the eyes on the emojis,"
m_ex_bay_01_51,I start to sweat
m_ex_bay_01_52,and get dizzy
m_ex_bay_01_53,all of a sudden.
m_ex_bay_01_54,So...
m_ex_bay_01_55,Are you okay now?
m_ex_bay_01_56,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_01_57,I'm feeling better now.
m_ex_bay_01_58,"Apparently if you keep exposing yourself to attention,"
m_ex_bay_01_59,you're supposed to be able to
m_ex_bay_01_60,overcome your fears to an extent.
m_ex_bay_01_61,"Okay, then how about using Bla to your advantage?"
m_ex_bay_01_62,What do you mean?
m_ex_bay_01_63,By purposefully using facial emojis.
m_ex_bay_01_64,Hmm...
m_ex_bay_01_65,Maybe someday there'll come a time when it won't bother you.
m_ex_bay_01_66,!!
m_ex_bay_01_67,I certainly hope that happens.
m_ex_bay_01_68,Let's give it a shot.
m_ex_bay_01_69,Yeah...
m_ex_bay_01_70,"All right,"
m_ex_bay_01_71,let's do it!
m_ex_bay_01_72,Sounds good. Looking forward to knowing you.
m_ex_bay_01_73,Me too.
m_ex_bay_01_74,Hehe.
m_ex_bay_02_1,Coach...
m_ex_bay_02_2,never mind.
m_ex_bay_02_3,??
m_ex_bay_02_4,Coach...
m_ex_bay_02_5,Um...
m_ex_bay_02_6,"No, never mind."
m_ex_bay_02_7,What's wrong?
m_ex_bay_02_8,I was wondering
m_ex_bay_02_9,if you knew
m_ex_bay_02_10,a secluded place
m_ex_bay_02_11,where we could
m_ex_bay_02_12,be alone.
m_ex_bay_02_13,What did you have in mind?
m_ex_bay_02_14,It's okay
m_ex_bay_02_15,if it's small.
m_ex_bay_02_16,What's important is that it's somewhere discreet
m_ex_bay_02_17,where no one would come.
m_ex_bay_02_18,What are you planning on doing to me?
m_ex_bay_02_19,Somewhere discreet?
m_ex_bay_02_20,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_02_21,Just the two of us?
m_ex_bay_02_22,Wait...
m_ex_bay_02_23,Coach!
m_ex_bay_02_24,What are you thinking?
m_ex_bay_02_25,What are you planning on doing to me?
m_ex_bay_02_26,What do you mean?
m_ex_bay_02_27,Isn't it obvious?
m_ex_bay_02_28,Is it?
m_ex_bay_02_29,Yes!
m_ex_bay_02_30,Cheerleading practice.
m_ex_bay_02_31,"Because of my fear of attention,"
m_ex_bay_02_32,"I usually practice alone,"
m_ex_bay_02_33,but this time there's a difficult move
m_ex_bay_02_34,that I was hoping to get your help with.
m_ex_bay_02_35,Darn. I got all excited for nothing.
m_ex_bay_02_36,Huh?
m_ex_bay_02_37,What are you talking about?
m_ex_bay_02_38,Hold on...
m_ex_bay_02_39,Coach...
m_ex_bay_02_40,Were you thinking of
m_ex_bay_02_41,some kind of funny business?
m_ex_bay_02_42,Me? Never.
m_ex_bay_02_43,So suspicious...
m_ex_bay_02_44,I swear!
m_ex_bay_02_45,"Okay, maybe a little."
m_ex_bay_02_46,Hmm...
m_ex_bay_02_47,"All right, if you say you weren't,"
m_ex_bay_02_48,I'll trust you.
m_ex_bay_02_49,You mean...
m_ex_bay_02_50,You were thinking...
m_ex_bay_02_51,about you and me?
m_ex_bay_02_52,"I'm just kidding around, hehe."
m_ex_bay_02_53,Whew.
m_ex_bay_02_54,"Anyway,"
m_ex_bay_02_55,do you know a good place?
m_ex_bay_02_56,How about my room?
m_ex_bay_02_57,Hmm...
m_ex_bay_02_58,Don't a lot of people come and go there?
m_ex_bay_02_59,"If we practice there,"
m_ex_bay_02_60,I'm worried that my phobia will only become worse.
m_ex_bay_02_61,I'll lock the door.
m_ex_bay_02_62,Huh?
m_ex_bay_02_63,Lock the door?
m_ex_bay_02_64,Isn't that
m_ex_bay_02_65,a bit...
m_ex_bay_02_66,strange?
m_ex_bay_02_67,Why? What are you thinking of?
m_ex_bay_02_68,Wha... What would I be thinking of?
m_ex_bay_02_69,"I don't know, you tell me."
m_ex_bay_02_70,No.
m_ex_bay_02_71,Nothing.
m_ex_bay_02_72,You're putting these strange thoughts into my head.
m_ex_bay_02_73,"No, I'm not. You're the one thinking about them."
m_ex_bay_02_74,No way!
m_ex_bay_02_75,Ugh.
m_ex_bay_02_76,Forget I asked.
m_ex_bay_02_77,I'll just practice alone.
m_ex_bay_02_78,I was only joking. Come on over and practice.
m_ex_bay_02_79,No.
m_ex_bay_02_80,Bay?
m_ex_bay_02_81,She no longer replies to any of my messages.
m_ex_bay_03_1,"Coach,"
m_ex_bay_03_2,I...
m_ex_bay_03_3,I'm ready.
m_ex_bay_03_4,I'm not ready yet.
m_ex_bay_03_5,What do you mean?
m_ex_bay_03_6,Huh?
m_ex_bay_03_7,...
m_ex_bay_03_8,"Coach,"
m_ex_bay_03_9,I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.
m_ex_bay_03_10,Sorry. What should I be ready for?
m_ex_bay_03_11,You said before that
m_ex_bay_03_12,we should practice using face emojis
m_ex_bay_03_13,to overcome my phobia.
m_ex_bay_03_14,"Oh, you mean that?"
m_ex_bay_03_15,Yes.
m_ex_bay_03_16,"So,"
m_ex_bay_03_17,"from now on,"
m_ex_bay_03_18,you can use those emojis
m_ex_bay_03_19,that I said I hated before.
m_ex_bay_03_20,Okay.
m_ex_bay_03_21,Whew...
m_ex_bay_03_22,Here we go.
m_ex_bay_03_23,Okay.
m_ex_bay_03_24,Start.
m_ex_bay_03_25,"Hi, Bay :-)"
m_ex_bay_03_26,Ugh.
m_ex_bay_03_27,Ah.
m_ex_bay_03_28,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_03_29,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_03_30,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_03_31,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_03_32,"Come on, you can do it."
m_ex_bay_03_33,Whew...
m_ex_bay_03_34,Okay.
m_ex_bay_03_35,Send it again.
m_ex_bay_03_36,Be strong :-)
m_ex_bay_03_37,Ugh.
m_ex_bay_03_38,Yeah.
m_ex_bay_03_39,Whew.
m_ex_bay_03_40,Again.
m_ex_bay_03_41,Send it again.
m_ex_bay_03_42,You can do it :-)
m_ex_bay_03_43,Ughhh.
m_ex_bay_03_44,One more time.
m_ex_bay_03_45,You're doing good :-)
m_ex_bay_03_46,Whew.
m_ex_bay_03_47,Ah.
m_ex_bay_03_48,"Coach,"
m_ex_bay_03_49,I think
m_ex_bay_03_50,it's gotten a little better.
m_ex_bay_03_51,Atta girl.
m_ex_bay_03_52,That's not it.
m_ex_bay_03_53,I couldn't have done it without you.
m_ex_bay_03_54,Really?
m_ex_bay_03_55,Of course.
m_ex_bay_03_56,"At first, all I could see were those eyes,"
m_ex_bay_03_57,"but as time went on,"
m_ex_bay_03_58,I was able to focus more on them being messages from you.
m_ex_bay_03_59,Hmm...
m_ex_bay_03_60,"Those eyes that once seemed so scary before aren't anymore,"
m_ex_bay_03_61,because I started to see them as your supportive gaze.
m_ex_bay_03_62,"When I did that,"
m_ex_bay_03_63,it slowly became easier to breathe.
m_ex_bay_03_64,Isn't that amazing?
m_ex_bay_03_65,I'm glad that it helped :-)
m_ex_bay_03_66,Ahhh.
m_ex_bay_03_67,Ughhh.
m_ex_bay_03_68,Coach.
m_ex_bay_03_69,"I don't think I'm 100% used to them just yet,"
m_ex_bay_03_70,so let's practice more next time.
m_ex_bay_03_71,I think Bay needs a bit more practice until she gets better.
m_ex_killthelord_01_1,Mister.
m_ex_killthelord_01_2,Who's this?
m_ex_killthelord_01_3,"It's me, Rosanna."
m_ex_killthelord_01_4,"Why does it say ""Rose"" instead?"
m_ex_killthelord_01_5,"Oh,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_6,that's a fake name
m_ex_killthelord_01_7,that I
m_ex_killthelord_01_8,use on here.
m_ex_killthelord_01_9,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_01_10,Weren't you using Steve too?
m_ex_killthelord_01_11,And what was that axe girl's fake name again?
m_ex_killthelord_01_12,Diamond
m_ex_killthelord_01_13,or something along that line?
m_ex_killthelord_01_14,Diana.
m_ex_killthelord_01_15,"Ah, yes! That's the one."
m_ex_killthelord_01_16,"Anyway,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_17,she's not pertinent to our conversation.
m_ex_killthelord_01_18,Mister.
m_ex_killthelord_01_19,"I know I said before that it was fine if you didn't tell me,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_20,"but it's killing me, and I've got to know."
m_ex_killthelord_01_21,What's going on?
m_ex_killthelord_01_22,Why do you have to disguise yourself
m_ex_killthelord_01_23,and act like a married couple with that axe girl?
m_ex_killthelord_01_24,We're on a secret mission.
m_ex_killthelord_01_25,We're role-playing as a couple.
m_ex_killthelord_01_26,?_?
m_ex_killthelord_01_27,"Clearly, you're not about to spill the truth to me, are you?"
m_ex_killthelord_01_28,Or perhaps...
m_ex_killthelord_01_29,Is it a situation where you can't tell me?
m_ex_killthelord_01_30,"Whatever it is, I'm not having any fun,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_31,so I'll drop it.
m_ex_killthelord_01_32,"I won't pry any further,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_33,"but if you ever feel like sharing,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_34,you know where to find me.
m_ex_killthelord_01_35,Got it?
m_ex_killthelord_01_36,Yeah.
m_ex_killthelord_01_37,"Also,"
m_ex_killthelord_01_38,I can tell that girl as dull as dishwater at first glance.
m_ex_killthelord_01_39,"If you ever find yourself bored at night, swing by my place."
m_ex_killthelord_01_40,I promise you'll find me much more entertaining.
m_ex_killthelord_01_41,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_01_42,"Looking forward to your next message, Mister."
m_ex_killthelord_02_1,Rosanna has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_killthelord_02_2,Rosanna has invited D to join the group.
m_ex_killthelord_02_3,"Welcome, everybody!"
m_ex_killthelord_02_4,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_02_5,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_killthelord_02_6,Ah.
m_ex_killthelord_02_7,"Since we've all decided to work together,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_8,I figured we should have a place to share information.
m_ex_killthelord_02_9,Good idea.
m_ex_killthelord_02_10,"If any of us come across anything,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_11,we can share it here with everyone else.
m_ex_killthelord_02_12,"Not only that,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_13,"but this also makes for quite an interesting pairing, wouldn't you say?"
m_ex_killthelord_02_14,"Me,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_15,and axe girl.
m_ex_killthelord_02_16,What's so interesting about that?
m_ex_killthelord_02_17,"Normally,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_18,"you and I don't have any reason for our paths to cross, yet here we are."
m_ex_killthelord_02_19,"This is the first time we've met properly,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_20,so I'd say that makes this an interesting occasion.
m_ex_killthelord_02_21,"Actually, come to think of it,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_22,I'm not entirely sure if your current appearance is real or not.
m_ex_killthelord_02_23,I've heard that you're quite adept at the art of disguise.
m_ex_killthelord_02_24,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_02_25,Is altering your face even possible?
m_ex_killthelord_02_26,It is.
m_ex_killthelord_02_27,I can do it whenever I need to.
m_ex_killthelord_02_28,How about right now?
m_ex_killthelord_02_29,"There are eyes on us,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_30,so I won't say anymore.
m_ex_killthelord_02_31,"My goodness,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_32,you have so many secrets.
m_ex_killthelord_02_33,You're just like the mysterious gathering we're trying to find out about.
m_ex_killthelord_02_34,Are there lots of secrets there too?
m_ex_killthelord_02_35,Oh yes.
m_ex_killthelord_02_36,It's not just merely difficult to approach those Sovereigns.
m_ex_killthelord_02_37,The only way you can partake in that gathering is by invitation.
m_ex_killthelord_02_38,It's as cloak-and-dagger
m_ex_killthelord_02_39,as it gets.
m_ex_killthelord_02_40,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_02_41,"In other words,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_42,you can say that
m_ex_killthelord_02_43,there's something fishy about it.
m_ex_killthelord_02_44,"Anyway,"
m_ex_killthelord_02_45,I'm excited to see what we turn up tomorrow.
m_ex_killthelord_02_46,Don't be late.
m_ex_killthelord_02_47,Right back at you.
m_ex_killthelord_02_48,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_03_1,"Mister,"
m_ex_killthelord_03_2,"I was going to see you one more time before I left,"
m_ex_killthelord_03_3,but you weren't in your seat?
m_ex_killthelord_03_4,"Axe girl isn't here either,"
m_ex_killthelord_03_5,so I'm assuming you two must have gone off somewhere.
m_ex_killthelord_03_6,Be careful.
m_ex_killthelord_03_7,"Kamila seems to have caught on,"
m_ex_killthelord_03_8,as she took off running somewhere
m_ex_killthelord_03_9,the moment our conversation ended.
m_ex_killthelord_03_10,Hmm...
m_ex_killthelord_03_11,It seems you're busy
m_ex_killthelord_03_12,since you're not reading my messages.
m_ex_killthelord_03_13,"If you ever find yourself in a bind,"
m_ex_killthelord_03_14,don't hesitate to reach out.
m_ex_killthelord_03_15,I'll drop everything and come running your way in a heartbeat.
m_ex_killthelord_04_1,"Wait, what?"
m_ex_killthelord_04_2,How's this group chat still here?
m_ex_killthelord_04_3,"How's it hanging,"
m_ex_killthelord_04_4,Mister?
m_ex_killthelord_04_5,Nothing noteworthy occurred.
m_ex_killthelord_04_6,I didn't ask you.
m_ex_killthelord_04_7,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_04_8,"Anyway, I'm glad to hear nothing major happened."
m_ex_killthelord_04_9,You mentioned you attended that gathering
m_ex_killthelord_04_10,because you were investigating something
m_ex_killthelord_04_11,that was related to your squad.
m_ex_killthelord_04_12,I thought we agreed on no questions?
m_ex_killthelord_04_13,Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?
m_ex_killthelord_04_14,For a good reason.
m_ex_killthelord_04_15,And what would that be?
m_ex_killthelord_04_16,"I'm still figuring a few things out,"
m_ex_killthelord_04_17,so I can't tell you right now.
m_ex_killthelord_04_18,"However,"
m_ex_killthelord_04_19,I may have reason to visit you soon.
m_ex_killthelord_04_20,What?
m_ex_killthelord_04_21,Messages can be quite incriminating evidence.
m_ex_killthelord_04_22,That's all I'll say for now.
m_ex_killthelord_04_23,What are you going on about? You're just talking to yourself at this point.
m_ex_killthelord_04_24,Why don't you fill me in?
m_ex_killthelord_04_25,D left the group chat.
m_ex_killthelord_04_26,"Good grief,"
m_ex_killthelord_04_27,this woman is the most irritating person I've ever met.
m_ex_killthelord_04_28,^_^
m_ex_killthelord_04_29,Rosanna left the group chat.
m_ex_killthelord_04_30,"By the time I checked my messages, Rosanna and D have both already left the group chat."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_1,Bay has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_2,Bay has invited Clay to join the group.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_3,Bay has invited Poli to join the group.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_4,"That's everyone, right?"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_5,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_onemoretime_01_6,"Wow, every chat I've had with Bay has been private."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_7,"It's kinda weird being part of a group chat, hehe."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_8,Wow!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_9,"Hi, everyone!"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_10,This is a temporary group chat for Rewind.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_11,I thought it would be nice
m_ex_onemoretime_01_12,"to have our own space to talk and share things,"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_13,so I created this group chat.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_14,Sounds like a great idea!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_15,"Poli,"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_16,I'd like to get started on
m_ex_onemoretime_01_17,"designing our outfits,"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_18,so do you have any thoughts
m_ex_onemoretime_01_19,or opinions?
m_ex_onemoretime_01_20,Stuff like color
m_ex_onemoretime_01_21,or the overall design.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_22,Hmm...
m_ex_onemoretime_01_23,I'm honestly okay with just about anything.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_24,I'm sure you'll be able to come up with something that suits me!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_25,I say you go with something cute.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_26,I say you go with something canine.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_27,Something cute?
m_ex_onemoretime_01_28,Can you be more specific?
m_ex_onemoretime_01_29,"I think Poli looks cute in anything she wears, hehe!"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_30,What the...?!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_31,Grrrrr!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_32,Hehehe.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_33,"All right,"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_34,"I'll try and prepare something that'll suit you, Poli."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_35,Everyone should try and get some rest tonight.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_36,"Things are gonna get a whole lot tougher starting tomorrow, thanks to practice."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_37,Keep a close eye on your physical conditions.
m_ex_onemoretime_01_38,"Now, let's get out there and have a good time."
m_ex_onemoretime_01_39,"All right, this is gonna be fun!"
m_ex_onemoretime_01_40,Woohoo!
m_ex_onemoretime_01_41,Let's do our best!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_1,"Great job at practice today, everyone."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_2,We're off to a great start.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_3,You all kicked butt out there!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_4,"By the way, sorry that I was late T_T"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_5,It's okay.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_6,It happens.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_7,"Yeah, it's all good."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_8,"How are you holding up, Poli?"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_9,Was everything today okay?
m_ex_onemoretime_02_10,Ah.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_11,"I was a little worried since it was my first time cheerleading,"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_12,but it was a ton of fun!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_13,"Plus, it's a great workout."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_14,I had a good time too.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_15,"I saw you out there breaking a sweat with the rest of us, Commander."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_16,Yeah.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_17,"I must admit that I was surprised, Coach. You did better than I thought you would."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_18,"Have you been getting private lessons, by any chance?"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_19,My original dream was actually to become a cheerleader.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_20,Is that so?
m_ex_onemoretime_02_21,How interesting.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_22,"Aw, c'mon, Bay."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_23,Put a little more life into your responses!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_24,T_T
m_ex_onemoretime_02_25,"Anyway,"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_26,I totally think being a cheerleader is like the coolest job ever!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_27,Motivating other people
m_ex_onemoretime_02_28,and giving them strength
m_ex_onemoretime_02_29,is super commendable!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_30,"Not only that, but when I'm out there,"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_31,"I feel like I'm cheering myself on as well, which gives me a real boost."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_32,Thank you for saying that.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_33,"Yeah, super motivating, Poli! I'm gonna cheer even harder next time 'cause of you, hehe."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_34,"Once again, good job today, everyone."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_35,"Get some rest,"
m_ex_onemoretime_02_36,and I'll see you tomorrow.
m_ex_onemoretime_02_37,Will do!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_38,"Be sure to get some rest yourself, Bay."
m_ex_onemoretime_02_39,See you all tomorrow!
m_ex_onemoretime_02_40,"Later, guys."
m_ex_onemoretime_03_1,Coach.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_2,Poli.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_3,We're sorry for dragging everyone down lately.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_4,"Yeah, we're totally sorry! :("
m_ex_onemoretime_03_5,Oh!
m_ex_onemoretime_03_6,Don't worry about it!
m_ex_onemoretime_03_7,By the way...
m_ex_onemoretime_03_8,Hmm...
m_ex_onemoretime_03_9,Have you two made up?
m_ex_onemoretime_03_10,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_onemoretime_03_11,"Yes,"
m_ex_onemoretime_03_12,we have.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_13,Did we make you worry? Sorry 'bout that.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_14,"Nah,"
m_ex_onemoretime_03_15,I wasn't all that worried.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_16,I knew you two would reconcile eventually.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_17,"Even though everything's resolved, I can't stop crying..."
m_ex_onemoretime_03_18,:'(
m_ex_onemoretime_03_19,What?
m_ex_onemoretime_03_20,Still?
m_ex_onemoretime_03_21,Yeah :'(
m_ex_onemoretime_03_22,So you ended up crying after all.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_23,"Earlier, her eyes were so red that they looked like macarons."
m_ex_onemoretime_03_24,:'(
m_ex_onemoretime_03_25,Your eyes are gonna be all swollen tomorrow.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_26,Be sure to ice them before you head to bed.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_27,Okay :'(
m_ex_onemoretime_03_28,"Anyway, thank you all for understanding."
m_ex_onemoretime_03_29,Let's keep at it tomorrow.
m_ex_onemoretime_03_30,You got it!
m_ex_onemoretime_03_31,"The competition is right around the corner, so let's keep our energy high."
m_ex_onemoretime_03_32,For sure!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_1,Did everyone get home safe?
m_ex_onemoretime_04_2,"Yeah, I just got back."
m_ex_onemoretime_04_3,"I'm kinda bummed, Poli :("
m_ex_onemoretime_04_4,"Starting tomorrow, I won't be seeing you as much :'("
m_ex_onemoretime_04_5,I'm really sad too!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_6,"Don't worry, tho. I'll visit you guys as often as I can!"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_7,I'll also come to watch your performances!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_8,That'd be great!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_9,"If you're coming to see us cheer,"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_10,be sure to let us know beforehand.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_11,"That way, we can make sure you get tickets for the best seats."
m_ex_onemoretime_04_12,"Wow,"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_13,thanks!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_14,Make sure to leave a seat open for me as well.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_15,Of course.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_16,"We wouldn't dream of leaving you out, Coach."
m_ex_onemoretime_04_17,Sweet!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_18,Hehehehe.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_19,"Anyway,"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_20,I'm really proud of you guys for working as hard as you did these past two weeks.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_21,"Thank you so much, hehehehehe!"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_22,I had a great time!
m_ex_onemoretime_04_23,"Also,"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_24,make sure to let me know if you win first place at the next competition.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_25,"We will, hehe!"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_26,"Sure thing,"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_27,we'll let you know.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_28,Hehe.
m_ex_onemoretime_04_29,"Good luck, Rewind!"
m_ex_onemoretime_04_30,"Yeah, good luck!"
m_ex_trony_01_1,Umm...
m_ex_trony_01_2,There are no further messages.
m_ex_trony_01_3,??
m_ex_trony_01_4,How's your day going? This is Trony from Electric Shock. Is this {AccountData.NickName}
m_ex_trony_01_5,Σ(°ロ°)
m_ex_trony_01_6,"Whoops, sorry about that."
m_ex_trony_01_7,I pressed enter too soon before I had a chance to run spell check :/
m_ex_trony_01_8,"Once again, there are no other follow-up messages."
m_ex_trony_01_9,... Hello?
m_ex_trony_01_10,How's your day going? This is Trony from Electric Shock. Is this {AccountData.NickName}?
m_ex_trony_01_11,Yes.
m_ex_trony_01_12,"No, it's not."
m_ex_trony_01_13,:D
m_ex_trony_01_14,Thank goodness.
m_ex_trony_01_15,I thought I'd sent the message to the wrong person
m_ex_trony_01_16,and they thought I was some kind of weirdo.
m_ex_trony_01_17,I've been worrying for a week straight.
m_ex_trony_01_18,An entire week?
m_ex_trony_01_19,Yeah.
m_ex_trony_01_20,(º д º ;;)
m_ex_trony_01_21,I'm so sorry for bothering you!
m_ex_trony_01_22,Let me make it up to you! I'll send you a custom Electric Shock...
m_ex_trony_01_23,Trony.
m_ex_trony_01_24,Yes?
m_ex_trony_01_25,That was a joke.
m_ex_trony_01_26,...
m_ex_trony_01_27,A joke?
m_ex_trony_01_28,A long time passed before I receive a message from Trony.
m_ex_trony_01_29,:(
m_ex_trony_01_30,Sorry for teasing you.
m_ex_trony_01_31,This is exhausting.
m_ex_trony_01_32,So what's going on?
m_ex_trony_01_33,Um...
m_ex_trony_01_34,Just a moment.
m_ex_trony_01_35,??
m_ex_trony_01_36,I should have saved what I'm going to send you in my notes.
m_ex_trony_01_37,"Meanwhile, I am waiting for Trony's reply."
m_ex_trony_01_38,"I know I may not be perfect, but I'll do my best going forward."
m_ex_trony_01_39,Yeah.
m_ex_trony_01_40,That's what I wanted to say.
m_ex_trony_01_41,Was it really necessary to write that down beforehand?
m_ex_trony_01_42,"Since we're going to be working together,"
m_ex_trony_01_43,I wanted to extend a formal greeting.
m_ex_trony_01_44,"Greetings are crucial for building good relationships,"
m_ex_trony_01_45,so I wrote a whole bunch of them and chose the best one.
m_ex_trony_01_46,I must have written at least a thousand of them.
m_ex_trony_01_47,That many?!
m_ex_trony_01_48,...
m_ex_trony_01_49,"I'm not being weird in wanting to do this,"
m_ex_trony_01_50,am I?
m_ex_trony_01_51,"No, not at all. I'm looking forward to working with you!"
m_ex_trony_01_52,!!
m_ex_trony_01_53,:D
m_ex_trony_01_54,"For some reason, interacting with Trony puts a smile on my face."
m_ex_trony_02_1,T_T
m_ex_trony_02_2,Commander!
m_ex_trony_02_3,What's up?
m_ex_trony_02_4,Um...
m_ex_trony_02_5,I went to a photosynthesis gathering with Elegg yesterday.
m_ex_trony_02_6,A what now?
m_ex_trony_02_7,It's a gathering that Elegg organized after attending the Ark Gaming Expo.
m_ex_trony_02_8,The main idea is to go outside as a group once a week and bask in the sun.
m_ex_trony_02_9,"There are four members: me, Elegg, Exia, and Maiden."
m_ex_trony_02_10,I could have figured that out without you saying.
m_ex_trony_02_11,Yeah...
m_ex_trony_02_12,"We all went outside yesterday,"
m_ex_trony_02_13,but they want to go again today...
m_ex_trony_02_14,T_T
m_ex_trony_02_15,Can you help me?
m_ex_trony_02_16,Help you how?
m_ex_trony_02_17,"You could tell them that I have an important appointment with you,"
m_ex_trony_02_18,and I can use that as an excuse!
m_ex_trony_02_19,"Oh, wait."
m_ex_trony_02_20,"No, that won't work."
m_ex_trony_02_21,??
m_ex_trony_02_22,I don't want to lie to Elegg.
m_ex_trony_02_23,Er...
m_ex_trony_02_24,But I don't want to head out either...
m_ex_trony_02_25,What do you all usually do when you're out?
m_ex_trony_02_26,"Usually, we'd be at the Arcade"
m_ex_trony_02_27,or watch an anime movie.
m_ex_trony_02_28,"Yeah,"
m_ex_trony_02_29,things like that.
m_ex_trony_02_30,I thought you said you all go out to sunbathe.
m_ex_trony_02_31,That's ri...
m_ex_trony_02_32,There is no response for a long time.
m_ex_trony_02_33,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_trony_02_34,Mr. Commander.
m_ex_trony_02_35,Mr. Commanderrrrrrrr!
m_ex_trony_02_36,Yes?
m_ex_trony_02_37,This is Elegg.
m_ex_trony_02_38,Trony and I are going to the Arcade.
m_ex_trony_02_39,Do you wanna come?
m_ex_trony_02_40,"If you do, we'll wait for you."
m_ex_trony_02_41,Elegg?
m_ex_trony_02_42,"I wait for a while, but there is no further reply."
m_ex_trony_02_43,I should head to the Arcade that Elegg mentioned.
m_ex_trony_03_1,Command.
m_ex_trony_03_2,Cmmmander.
m_ex_trony_03_3,Com mander.
m_ex_trony_03_4,??
m_ex_trony_03_5,"Hehe, it worked!"
m_ex_trony_03_6,I successfully summoned the Commander!
m_ex_trony_03_7,"You're not drunk, are you?"
m_ex_trony_03_8,Drunk?
m_ex_trony_03_9,There are no further messages.
m_ex_trony_03_10,Trony?
m_ex_trony_03_11,Yeah?
m_ex_trony_03_12,Are you okay?
m_ex_trony_03_13,I'm greeat!
m_ex_trony_03_14,Peachy!
m_ex_trony_03_15,Um...
m_ex_trony_03_16,I'm buper hapy
m_ex_trony_03_17,I'm drinking the qrink Egg gave me.
m_ex_trony_03_18,Egg?
m_ex_trony_03_19,What?
m_ex_trony_03_20,??
m_ex_trony_03_21,??
m_ex_trony_03_22,Who is Egg?
m_ex_trony_03_23,Beats me.
m_ex_trony_03_24,Leemme look
m_ex_trony_03_25,at Missiliis database.
m_ex_trony_03_26,"Ah,"
m_ex_trony_03_27,there's a photo.
m_ex_trony_03_28,Elegg.
m_ex_trony_03_29,So you were talking about Elegg...
m_ex_trony_03_30,Huh?
m_ex_trony_03_31,Commander.
m_ex_trony_03_32,I'm so dizzy.
m_ex_trony_03_33,Hmm...
m_ex_trony_03_34,I think I need to sleep.
m_ex_trony_03_35,"All right then,"
m_ex_trony_03_36,I'm out.
m_ex_trony_03_37,Trony?
m_ex_trony_03_38,I wait for further messages but to no avail.
m_ex_trony_03_39,Contact me when you wake up.
m_ex_trony_03_40,"Later on, I speak to Elegg, who tells me that the energy drink Ether concocted was to blame."
m_ex_trony_03_41,It turns out
m_ex_trony_03_42,Trony remained burrowed under her blanket for a while.
m_ex_darkhero_01_1,Exia has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_01_2,Exia has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_01_3,Exia has invited Elegg to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_01_4,Exia has invited Maiden to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_01_5,That should be everyone.
m_ex_darkhero_01_6,"I'll be making raid announcements in here, so keep your eyes peeled."
m_ex_darkhero_01_7,"""Let's Photosynthesize""? What's with the group name?"
m_ex_darkhero_01_8,"Last time when Exia and Trony created a group chat,"
m_ex_darkhero_01_9,our attempts at photosynthesis didn't go so well.
m_ex_darkhero_01_10,So I thought using this name for the group chat would give us
m_ex_darkhero_01_11,some extra motivation to give it another try.
m_ex_darkhero_01_12,Huh?
m_ex_darkhero_01_13,Is that why?
m_ex_darkhero_01_14,Then count me out.
m_ex_darkhero_01_15,Me too.
m_ex_darkhero_01_16,"Yeah, I'm not into it either."
m_ex_darkhero_01_17,!!
m_ex_darkhero_01_18,"Oh come on, guys! Don't you think you're overreacting just a tad?"
m_ex_darkhero_01_19,"Elegg, is there a window near you?"
m_ex_darkhero_01_20,"Yeah, why?"
m_ex_darkhero_01_21,Is there sunlight coming in?
m_ex_darkhero_01_22,... Yeah.
m_ex_darkhero_01_23,There you go. That's enough for your precious photosynthesis.
m_ex_darkhero_01_24,"Yeah, what she said!"
m_ex_darkhero_01_25,"I knew there's a reason you're the leader, Exia!"
m_ex_darkhero_01_26,"Mr. Commander,"
m_ex_darkhero_01_27,what do you have to say about all this?
m_ex_darkhero_01_28,"... I wish you the best, Elegg."
m_ex_darkhero_01_29,What?!
m_ex_darkhero_02_1,"All right,"
m_ex_darkhero_02_2,"as the leader,"
m_ex_darkhero_02_3,I'm
m_ex_darkhero_02_4,officially
m_ex_darkhero_02_5,calling
m_ex_darkhero_02_6,for
m_ex_darkhero_02_7,a
m_ex_darkhero_02_8,meeting.
m_ex_darkhero_02_9,"Everyone,"
m_ex_darkhero_02_10,gather 'round!
m_ex_darkhero_02_11,Here!
m_ex_darkhero_02_12,Here!
m_ex_darkhero_02_13,Here!
m_ex_darkhero_02_14,Where's Trony?
m_ex_darkhero_02_15,It says the message has been read.
m_ex_darkhero_02_16,Here.
m_ex_darkhero_02_17,There you are.
m_ex_darkhero_02_18,"So, what was it you wanted to tell us, Exia?"
m_ex_darkhero_02_19,"If You Don't Know, Memorize This.txt"
m_ex_darkhero_02_20,This document includes summaries of the strategies
m_ex_darkhero_02_21,for Phases 1 to 3.
m_ex_darkhero_02_22,I want you all to commit it to memory before the next raid.
m_ex_darkhero_02_23,"Okay, I'll try to memorize as much as possible."
m_ex_darkhero_02_24,"I have full faith in you, Maiden."
m_ex_darkhero_02_25,"Yeah, we know we can always count on you."
m_ex_darkhero_02_26,"Thanks, guys!"
m_ex_darkhero_02_27,Hey!
m_ex_darkhero_02_28,How about me?
m_ex_darkhero_02_29,How did I do?
m_ex_darkhero_02_30,You did fine. Just stop trying to install BOOM all the time.
m_ex_darkhero_02_31,"Hehe... Okay, I'll try."
m_ex_darkhero_02_32,Erm...
m_ex_darkhero_02_33,"For a while, there are no further messages from anyone."
m_ex_darkhero_02_34,Trony left the group.
m_ex_darkhero_02_35,??
m_ex_darkhero_02_36,Elegg has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_02_37,Trony? What happened?
m_ex_darkhero_02_38,"Nobody was sending any messages,"
m_ex_darkhero_02_39,so I thought I was in the wrong group chat.
m_ex_darkhero_02_40,T_T
m_ex_darkhero_02_41,... Seriously?
m_ex_darkhero_02_42,"Anyway, were you going to say something before?"
m_ex_darkhero_02_43,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_darkhero_02_44,I'll try my best :D
m_ex_darkhero_02_45,Spoken like a doe-eyed newbie.
m_ex_darkhero_02_46,It's enough to make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
m_ex_darkhero_02_47,"So, when is the next raid?"
m_ex_darkhero_02_48,How is everyone's schedule looking next week?
m_ex_darkhero_02_49,I don't have anything going on.
m_ex_darkhero_02_50,Me neither.
m_ex_darkhero_02_51,I'm free as well.
m_ex_darkhero_02_52,"Shall we say this time next week, then?"
m_ex_darkhero_02_53,Sounds like a plan.
m_ex_darkhero_02_54,"Right, I nearly forgot. Maiden, why did Boss call you?"
m_ex_darkhero_02_55,"Sorry, but I've got to go."
m_ex_darkhero_02_56,Guillotine just arrived.
m_ex_darkhero_02_57,Please pray for me that nothing goes wrong.
m_ex_darkhero_02_58,"Hehe, it's probably nothing."
m_ex_darkhero_02_59,See you all next week.
m_ex_darkhero_03_1,Commander.
m_ex_darkhero_03_2,Commander.
m_ex_darkhero_03_3,Commander!
m_ex_darkhero_03_4,Yes?
m_ex_darkhero_03_5,Do you want to catch a movie tomorrow?
m_ex_darkhero_03_6,I've got two tickets to the Black Ark Ranger movie premiere.
m_ex_darkhero_03_7,Sure.
m_ex_darkhero_03_8,Great!
m_ex_darkhero_03_9,But I've got a question...
m_ex_darkhero_03_10,What is it?
m_ex_darkhero_03_11,"Why are you using Trony's account, Elegg?"
m_ex_darkhero_03_12,Huh? How did you...?
m_ex_darkhero_03_13,There are no messages for a while.
m_ex_darkhero_03_14,"Sorry,"
m_ex_darkhero_03_15,Elegg snatched away my phone.
m_ex_darkhero_03_16,Trony wanted me to help her ask
m_ex_darkhero_03_17,if you wanna catch a movie.
m_ex_darkhero_03_18,I see.
m_ex_darkhero_03_19,Trony sure doesn't waste time getting what she wants.
m_ex_darkhero_03_20,??
m_ex_darkhero_03_21,"You do realize this is a group chat, don't you?"
m_ex_darkhero_03_22,Trony left the group.
m_ex_darkhero_03_23,Did she leave again?
m_ex_darkhero_03_24,Exia has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_darkhero_03_25,T_T
m_ex_darkhero_03_26,"So you're free tomorrow, Mr. Commander?"
m_ex_darkhero_03_27,Sure. Where do you want to meet?
m_ex_darkhero_03_28,!!
m_ex_darkhero_03_29,Uh...
m_ex_darkhero_03_30,Is it the square okay?
m_ex_darkhero_03_31,Okay.
m_ex_darkhero_03_32,:D
m_ex_darkhero_03_33,Such honesty!
m_ex_darkhero_03_34,I like it!
m_ex_darkhero_04_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_darkhero_04_2,"in case you were worried about me,"
m_ex_darkhero_04_3,I'm just letting you know that
m_ex_darkhero_04_4,"I did get chewed out by Ingrid,"
m_ex_darkhero_04_5,but it wasn't all that bad
m_ex_darkhero_04_6,since Guillotine got an earful along with me.
m_ex_darkhero_04_7,Ingrid was upset with her that she didn't intervene.
m_ex_darkhero_04_8,"I don't know when I will see you again,"
m_ex_darkhero_04_9,"but if I ever do come back,"
m_ex_darkhero_04_10,we'll be sure to clear the last phase of that raid.
m_ex_darkhero_04_11,Goodbye.
m_ex_darkhero_04_12,BlackRose left the group.
m_ex_electricshock_01_1,"Oh boy,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_2,something major has happened.
m_ex_electricshock_01_3,??
m_ex_electricshock_01_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_electricshock_01_5,It has to do with Syuen.
m_ex_electricshock_01_6,O.O
m_ex_electricshock_01_7,"Elegg, it's been a pleasure knowing you."
m_ex_electricshock_01_8,I'll go ahead first.
m_ex_electricshock_01_9,What are you talking about?
m_ex_electricshock_01_10,I haven't even said anything yet.
m_ex_electricshock_01_11,"Trony, calm down. Let's listen to what Elegg has to say first."
m_ex_electricshock_01_12,Okay.
m_ex_electricshock_01_13,"Elegg,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_14,sorry for interrupting.
m_ex_electricshock_01_15,"Hehe, it's okay."
m_ex_electricshock_01_16,"As I was saying, Syuen..."
m_ex_electricshock_01_17,O.O
m_ex_electricshock_01_18,"Elegg, it's been a pleasure knowing you."
m_ex_electricshock_01_19,It looks like this is where it all ends for me.
m_ex_electricshock_01_20,...
m_ex_electricshock_01_21,Sorry.
m_ex_electricshock_01_22,"It's a reflex, I swear!"
m_ex_electricshock_01_23,Seems like you two have had some traumatic experiences with Syuen in the past.
m_ex_electricshock_01_24,We certainly have.
m_ex_electricshock_01_25,She's always asking me to do all sorts of weird things.
m_ex_electricshock_01_26,Like...?
m_ex_electricshock_01_27,Like sticking a screen protector on her computer monitors.
m_ex_electricshock_01_28,Filling out paperwork for her.
m_ex_electricshock_01_29,Turning off the lights when she goes to sleep.
m_ex_electricshock_01_30,Is this what you do regularly?
m_ex_electricshock_01_31,T_T
m_ex_electricshock_01_32,"Anyway, Elegg,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_33,what were you going to say about Syuen?
m_ex_electricshock_01_34,"Oh, right."
m_ex_electricshock_01_35,"She's heading to our dorm right now, so I figured we should probably clean up beforehand."
m_ex_electricshock_01_36,Uh oh.
m_ex_electricshock_01_37,Syuen is calling me from outside my door right now.
m_ex_electricshock_01_38,"... Sorry, Trony,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_39,but I might be a little late.
m_ex_electricshock_01_40,Elegg?
m_ex_electricshock_01_41,There is no further response from Elegg.
m_ex_electricshock_01_42,"Commander,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_43,"if you don't hear from me tomorrow,"
m_ex_electricshock_01_44,don't forget to contact the A.C.P.U.
m_ex_electricshock_01_45,"After that, there are no more messages from Trony either."
m_ex_electricshock_01_46,R.I.P.
m_ex_electricshock_01_47,I silently mourn for both of them.
m_ex_electricshock_02_1,"Okay, the meeting is now in session."
m_ex_electricshock_02_2,We're going to decide what to do this weekend?
m_ex_electricshock_02_3,Yep!
m_ex_electricshock_02_4,I propose we game.
m_ex_electricshock_02_5,Something other than that.
m_ex_electricshock_02_6,"We play video games together every day,"
m_ex_electricshock_02_7,so there's no need to suggest it.
m_ex_electricshock_02_8,Still... it's a lotta fun.
m_ex_electricshock_02_9,True that.
m_ex_electricshock_02_10,How about we go to the Arcade and play Iron Punch?
m_ex_electricshock_02_11,You just said we couldn't suggest gaming.
m_ex_electricshock_02_12,Haha.
m_ex_electricshock_02_13,What's important is that we leave the dorm.
m_ex_electricshock_02_14,"Let's go to the Arcade first,"
m_ex_electricshock_02_15,"play all the games there,"
m_ex_electricshock_02_16,and then...
m_ex_electricshock_02_17,Hmm...
m_ex_electricshock_02_18,"Okay,"
m_ex_electricshock_02_19,maybe we can get something to eat?
m_ex_electricshock_02_20,Hm...
m_ex_electricshock_02_21,"Trony, is there anything specifically that you wanted to do?"
m_ex_electricshock_02_22,Trony?
m_ex_electricshock_02_23,Are you there?
m_ex_electricshock_02_24,"Honestly,"
m_ex_electricshock_02_25,I'm getting tired just listening to all of these messages.
m_ex_electricshock_02_26,Let's go out some other time.
m_ex_electricshock_02_27,But we haven't finished making plans!
m_ex_electricshock_02_28,The meeting for the long-awaited 100th commemorative outing
m_ex_electricshock_02_29,"comes to an end like every meeting does, with Trony leaving the group chat."

m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_7,"Ah, yes. I see that you've changed your profile pic."

m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_24,"Aww, really?"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_25,Boohoo... T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_26,You seem awfully happy about this bunny outfit.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_27,"Ah,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_28,you bet I am!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_29,"I've always wanted to be like you, Rabbity! :3"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_30,Do you think it suits me?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_31,It suits you perfectly.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_32,Wowee!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_33,A compliment from Rabbity? I couldn't ask for anything more!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_34,Isn't it uncomfortable to wear that outfit?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_35,To be honest...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_36,it isn't the comfiest thing in the world :/
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_37,"But since you like it so much, I'll wear it as often as I can!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_38,I'll also make sure to wear it next time we meet! :3
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_39,"I'll hold you to that promise, haha."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_01_40,It's a deal! :D
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_1,"Rabbity,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_2,I'm curious about something.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_4,Have you ever considered trying on a bunny outfit?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_5,"Not really, but now that you mention it, should I?"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_6,Defo!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_7,"Boss' clothes may be similar,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_8,but I believe
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_9,they'll suit you better!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_10,Hehe :3
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_11,Clothes that Mustang wear... That's a bit...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_12,"Aww, c'mon!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_13,Pretty pleaaaaaaase?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_14,You'd look great!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_15,"... All right, fine. I'll try it on."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_16,Yahoo!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_17,This is the happiest day of my life!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_18,We can all put on bunny outfits and throw a big party!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_19,"Sure, if we have time."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_20,Hehe.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_21,Let's invite the white and black bunnies too!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_22,And Twinkling Bunny as well!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_23,And Slippery Bunny...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_24,And Golden Bunny!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_25,"Oh, oh! We should also invite Doctor Bunny..."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_26,"Hold on, Alice, that may be too many guests..."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_27,"Hehe, I'll take care of your outfit first!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_28,You have one for me?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_29,Of course!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_30,"Last time, I saw"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_31,spare bunny outfits in Boss' closet!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_32,Is... that so?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_33,I better get to it!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_34,Right now?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_35,Of course!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_36,Wait...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_37,I'm on my way there now!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_38,I'll be there in a jiffy!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_39,"Hold on, listen to me..."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_40,(/^ㅁ^)/=3=3=3
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_41,... Alice?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_42,There is no response.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_02_43,I better make myself scarce before Alice gets here.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_1,Rabbity... T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_2,Are you asleep?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_3,Rabbity... T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_5,I had a scary dream :/
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_6,What was it about?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_7,You and the Queen
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_8,were being taken away by the Queen of Hearts.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_9,Are you okay now?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_10,Yeah...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_11,"I was really scared,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_12,but I feel a bit better now.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_13,"You don't think the dream was a bad omen, do you?"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_14,Hm... it doesn't exactly bode well.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_15,T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_16,I'm really scared that it's gonna come true T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_17,"You can't die, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_18,"Don't worry, nothing bad is going to happen to me."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_19,Really?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_20,Of course! The Queen of Hearts is no match for me.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_21,*Sob* But I'm still kinda scared...
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_22,"It was just a dream, so don't worry yourself too much."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_23,Can I message you
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_24,whenever I have a bad dream?
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_25,Of course.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_26,Hehehe.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_27,Just hearing you say that
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_28,makes me feel relieved already!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_29,"You're the best, Rabbity!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_30,If
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_31,"you ever have a bad dream,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_32,you can message me too!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_33,"Will do, thanks."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_34,Oh!
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_35,"I didn't wake you up or anything,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_36,"right,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_37,Rabbity? T_T
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_38,"No, you didn't. I was having a hard time falling asleep anyway."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_39,"Oh good, that's a relief!"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_40,"Well, I'm sure you want to try and get some sleep,"
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_41,so I'll leave you be.
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_42,"Okay, see you next time."
m_ex_alice_wonderlandbunny_03_43,Bye! ^__^
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_1,Master.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_2,Master!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_3,What is it?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_4,Hehe.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_5,What do you think of my new profile pic?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_6,It's pretty.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_7,It's nothing to write home about...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_8,Really?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_9,Hehehehehe!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_10,Thanks!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_11,T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_12,Really? Is it that bad?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_13,Just kidding. You look great.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_14,"Oh, thank goodness!"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_15,"So you've gone from being a maid to a bunny girl, is that it?"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_16,That's right! Hehehe!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_17,"Which do you prefer, Master?"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_18,"Personally, I prefer your original maid uniform."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_19,"Personally, I like the bunny outfit a bit more."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_20,"Hehe, I figured you'd say that."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_21,I also think the maid uniform suits me best.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_22,"Hehe, if you like it that much,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_23,I'll be sure to wear it more often in the future.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_24,"Anything you wear looks good on you, Soda."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_25,"Hehe, I'm glad to hear you say that!"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_26,"Anyways,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_27,I ought to get back to cleaning.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_28,You're still cleaning even after becoming a bunny girl?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_29,Of course!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_30,"I may be dressed up like a bunny girl,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_31,but that doesn't change the fact that
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_32,I'll always be a maid at heart!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_33,Spoken like a true professional maid.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_34,You betcha!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_35,Hehe!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_36,"In that case, could you clean the Commander's Room now?"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_37,Sure thing!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_38,I'm on it!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_39,There is no response for a while.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_40,Master!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_41,I'm all done!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_42,Hehe.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_43,Huh? No one came into my room.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_44,Eh?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_45,Whaaatttt??
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_46,Whose room did you clean?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_47,I... I'm not sure. T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_48,"Well, it should be okay. If anything, you did someone else a favor."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_49,"True that. Anyway, I'll head over to the Commander's Room now."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_50,"Once again, there is no response from Soda for a while."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_01_51,I think she may have wandered into someone else's room again...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_1,"Master,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_2,I just came up with a great idea!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_3,Would you like to hear it?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_4,What is it?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_5,I'm thinking of holding a
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_6,new Maid For You event.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_7,What kind of event?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_8,A bunny girl-themed event!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_9,What do you think?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_10,Bunny girl maids? That sounds amazing!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_11,I'm not sure whether that's a great idea...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_12,"I know,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_13,right?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_14,This outfit would look absolutely adorable
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_15,on Ade and Cocoa! Hehehe!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_16,Oh...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_17,You think so? :(
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_18,I thought it would be pretty cute...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_19,"Just kidding, hehe."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_20,??
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_21,Really...?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_22,Yeah. I think the others would look great in bunny outfits.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_23,Hehe...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_24,That's what I thought too!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_25,I'm sure it'd be a big hit with the customers.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_26,"I think so too,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_27,but...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_28,Ade may not like this idea...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_29,Why not?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_30,"For her,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_31,wearing the proper uniform
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_32,is imperative to being a maid.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_33,"I also think it's important, but..."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_34,What if we try to convince her?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_35,!!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_36,You'd do that for me?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_37,"You're the best, Master!"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_38,I'm dying to see Maid For You dress up in bunny outfits.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_39,"Hehe, the fact you're so excited about this really fills me with confidence!"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_40,Let's discuss this further in my room.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_41,Okay!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_42,I'm on my way there now!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_02_43,Thank you for always helping me :)
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_1,"Hey Cocoa, I'm really sorry for today T_T"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_2,"With so many customers today, you must've been under so much pressure..."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_3,And I kept slipping and breaking dishes...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_4,and even spilled food all over the floor...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_5,I'm super duper sorry! T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_6,... Cocoa?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_7,Are you asleep?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_8,What about Cocoa?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_9,?!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_10,Huh...?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_11,Master?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_12,I think you messaged the wrong person.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_13,?!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_14,Wha?
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_15,Oh my gosh!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_16,T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_17,Sorry about that!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_18,I meant to send all that to Cocoa.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_19,I didn't even realize I sent it to you...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_20,"It's all good, everyone makes mistakes sometimes."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_21,"Still, I'm sorry..."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_22,"You're really letting those slip-ups get to you today, huh?"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_23,Yeah... T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_24,"You don't think Cocoa will be too mad, do you?"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_25,I doubt it.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_26,"Today was like super hectic,"
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_27,and I feel like I totally got in everyone's way... T_T
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_28,"You tried your best, and that's what's important."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_29,I guess...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_30,but...
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_31,I still feel bad about it :(
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_32,Keep your head up and work hard so that you can gain her trust.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_33,!!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_34,You're right!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_35,I've got to work as hard as I possibly can
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_36,so that everyone knows they can depend on me.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_37,That's the spirit! I'll help you as well.
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_38,All right!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_39,I will work harder!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_40,Let's give it our all!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_41,We can do this!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_42,Woohoo! Let's goooooo!
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_43,"You've got a long day ahead of you tomorrow, so get some rest."
m_ex_soda_twinklingbunny_03_44,"Gotcha! You get some rest too, Master!"
m_ex_clay_01_1,Hi Coach!
m_ex_clay_01_2,This is Clay
m_ex_clay_01_3,from Rewind! Hehehe!
m_ex_clay_01_4,"Hello, Clay."
m_ex_clay_01_5,"Hehe! I heard I'll be working together with you,"
m_ex_clay_01_6,so I wanted to pop in and say hi!
m_ex_clay_01_7,"As far as cheerleading goes, I'm still working on some of the more difficult moves,"
m_ex_clay_01_8,but I'm confident in my ability
m_ex_clay_01_9,to engage with the audience.
m_ex_clay_01_10,"I'll put my best foot forward with everything we do,"
m_ex_clay_01_11,promise!
m_ex_clay_01_12,Glad to hear that!
m_ex_clay_01_13,Hehe.
m_ex_clay_01_14,"I'm in the practice room now,"
m_ex_clay_01_15,getting ready for our next competition!
m_ex_clay_01_16,I can't believe that
m_ex_clay_01_17,"I'm actually practicing with Bay, my role model!"
m_ex_clay_01_18,"Thinking back, I was sooo lucky during my audition!"
m_ex_clay_01_19,Hehehe.
m_ex_clay_01_20,It wasn't luck. You worked hard to get where you are.
m_ex_clay_01_21,"Oh no, not at all! T_T"
m_ex_clay_01_22,"I still have a long way to go, so I need to work even harder!"
m_ex_clay_01_23,"That way, Bay and I can ensure that Rewind stays up and running."
m_ex_clay_01_24,You're quite impressive.
m_ex_clay_01_25,"Thanks, hehe."
m_ex_clay_01_26,"For that, today's training is all about honing in on my rhythm!"
m_ex_clay_01_27,"Oh,"
m_ex_clay_01_28,Bay just got back.
m_ex_clay_01_29,I better get back to practice!
m_ex_clay_01_30,Good luck.
m_ex_clay_01_31,"Same to you, Coach!"
m_ex_clay_02_1,Coach... T_T
m_ex_clay_02_2,What's wrong?
m_ex_clay_02_3,I've got something on my mind...
m_ex_clay_02_4,Any chance you could lend me your ear?
m_ex_clay_02_5,"Yes, of course."
m_ex_clay_02_6,Thanks.
m_ex_clay_02_7,"You know how hopeless I am with rhythm,"
m_ex_clay_02_8,right?
m_ex_clay_02_9,"Yes, I know about that."
m_ex_clay_02_10,"Sure, but you have plenty of other positive qualities."
m_ex_clay_02_11,OMG! Does everyone already know... T_T
m_ex_clay_02_12,"Thank you for saying that, Coach. T_T"
m_ex_clay_02_13,I've been doing a bunch of the training with Bay
m_ex_clay_02_14,"to work on my rhythms, but..."
m_ex_clay_02_15,I haven't seen any improvement... T_T
m_ex_clay_02_16,I see.
m_ex_clay_02_17,So...
m_ex_clay_02_18,Is there any special way you think
m_ex_clay_02_19,I can enhance my sense of rhythm?
m_ex_clay_02_20,I feel like I've tried all the usual methods by now. T_T
m_ex_clay_02_21,Hmm... How about playing a rhythm game?
m_ex_clay_02_22,Huh?
m_ex_clay_02_23,A rhythm game?
m_ex_clay_02_24,Yeah.
m_ex_clay_02_25,I've never tried it before :/
m_ex_clay_02_26,How do you play the game?
m_ex_clay_02_27,Just press the keys to the rhythm of the music.
m_ex_clay_02_28,Hmm... I'm not so sure about this...
m_ex_clay_02_29,Try it. Press a few keys to the beat of the music where you're at.
m_ex_clay_02_30,!!
m_ex_clay_02_31,A
m_ex_clay_02_32,B
m_ex_clay_02_33,A
m_ex_clay_02_34,...
m_ex_clay_02_35,D!!
m_ex_clay_02_36,Seems like you're doing pretty well.
m_ex_clay_02_37,You think so?
m_ex_clay_02_38,"Next, go for A B Z X C D."
m_ex_clay_02_39,Okay!
m_ex_clay_02_40,A
m_ex_clay_02_41,B
m_ex_clay_02_42,D
m_ex_clay_02_43,...
m_ex_clay_02_44,"Clay's responses are becoming increasingly delayed, with more and more time passing between each one."
m_ex_clay_02_45,C
m_ex_clay_02_46,...
m_ex_clay_02_47,D?
m_ex_clay_02_48,Ugh...
m_ex_clay_02_49,"This is too hard, Coach! T_T"
m_ex_clay_02_50,It looks like we'll need to try some other methods.
m_ex_clay_03_1,Coach!
m_ex_clay_03_2,Yes?
m_ex_clay_03_3,Follow me!
m_ex_clay_03_4,... Okay?
m_ex_clay_03_5,Put your hands up in the air
m_ex_clay_03_6,and clap three times!
m_ex_clay_03_7,*Clap clap clap*
m_ex_clay_03_8,"Next up, do the wave!"
m_ex_clay_03_9,From the left. Swoooosh!
m_ex_clay_03_10,Swoooosh.
m_ex_clay_03_11,Now from the right! Swoooosh!
m_ex_clay_03_12,Swoooosh.
m_ex_clay_03_13,"Now, face the front and scream as loud as you can!"
m_ex_clay_03_14,Ready? Go!
m_ex_clay_03_15,Wooohooooooooo!
m_ex_clay_03_16,Hehehehe.
m_ex_clay_03_17,I knew you could do it!
m_ex_clay_03_18,"You did great, Coach!"
m_ex_clay_03_19,You've even got me pumped up now!
m_ex_clay_03_20,That's because you're so great at engaging with the audience ^0^
m_ex_clay_03_21,"Thaaaaanks, hehe."
m_ex_clay_03_22,That emoticon is so cute!
m_ex_clay_03_23,It makes you look like you're really shouting.
m_ex_clay_03_24,Did you really
m_ex_clay_03_25,shout out loud just now? Hehehe.
m_ex_clay_03_26,You bet I did!
m_ex_clay_03_27,Wow!
m_ex_clay_03_28,Then let's do it again!
m_ex_clay_03_29,Reeeewwwwwiiiiind!
m_ex_clay_03_30,Reeeewwwwwiiiiind!
m_ex_clay_03_31,I love you!
m_ex_clay_03_32,I love you!
m_ex_clay_03_33,I can't hear you!
m_ex_clay_03_34,One more time!
m_ex_clay_03_35,Wooohooooooooo!
m_ex_clay_03_36,There is some movement outside the door.
m_ex_clay_03_37,"In the distance, Rapi leaves with an expression as if she has seen something she shouldn't have..."
m_ex_clay_03_38,"Woohoo, hehe! It's so exciting to do this together!"
m_ex_clay_03_39,"Don't you think so, Coach?"
m_ex_clay_03_40,Coach?
m_ex_clay_03_41,"Sorry, give me just a second."
m_ex_clay_03_42,???
m_ex_clay_03_43,Coach?
m_ex_clay_03_44,Where did you go?
m_ex_clay_03_45,Coach?
m_ex_claymore_01_1,Clay has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_claymore_01_2,Clay has invited Milk to join the group.
m_ex_claymore_01_3,Hehe.
m_ex_claymore_01_4,That should be everyone.
m_ex_claymore_01_5,What's going on?
m_ex_claymore_01_6,Pal's in here too?
m_ex_claymore_01_7,What's up with the name of this group chat?
m_ex_claymore_01_8,"""Let's Beat Marin""?"
m_ex_claymore_01_9,"Hehe, that's right!"
m_ex_claymore_01_10,"Since we've gathered here to best Marin,"
m_ex_claymore_01_11,I thought that name would be appropriate.
m_ex_claymore_01_12,"I like it,"
m_ex_claymore_01_13,but is it really necessary to make an entirely separate group chat?
m_ex_claymore_01_14,"We're meeting tomorrow, right?"
m_ex_claymore_01_15,"Yep, that's right!"
m_ex_claymore_01_16,Coach and I will be going to
m_ex_claymore_01_17,the cafe you work at tomorrow.
m_ex_claymore_01_18,But the reason I created this group chat
m_ex_claymore_01_19,is that we've got a few things to check before then.
m_ex_claymore_01_20,Like what?
m_ex_claymore_01_21,Coach and I have laid out some things for you.
m_ex_claymore_01_22,"As you're going through them,"
m_ex_claymore_01_23,we'll be recording your progress in this chat room.
m_ex_claymore_01_24,"That way, it'll be easier to keep tabs on each other."
m_ex_claymore_01_25,What exactly am I supposed to do?
m_ex_claymore_01_26,"Oh, right."
m_ex_claymore_01_27,"Sorry, but that's something we really have to explain in person."
m_ex_claymore_01_28,We'll be sure to explain everything in detail tomorrow.
m_ex_claymore_01_29,Now you've got me curious.
m_ex_claymore_01_30,You're not going to even give me a hint?
m_ex_claymore_01_31,"Hehe. A hint, you say?"
m_ex_claymore_01_32,Hmm...
m_ex_claymore_01_33,Some secret strategies to beat Marin! Hehe.
m_ex_claymore_01_34,There's your hint.
m_ex_claymore_01_35,Huh?
m_ex_claymore_01_36,I don't have a clue what that means.
m_ex_claymore_01_37,"Anyway, you said you'd tell me tomorrow,"
m_ex_claymore_01_38,so I'll just wait till then.
m_ex_claymore_01_39,See you tomorrow!
m_ex_claymore_01_40,See you.
m_ex_claymore_02_1,Milk!
m_ex_claymore_02_2,Just checking in to see
m_ex_claymore_02_3,if you watched the video 10 times like you're supposed to.
m_ex_claymore_02_4,"I've watched it eight times so far,"
m_ex_claymore_02_5,but it's so boring.
m_ex_claymore_02_6,I'm pretty sure I could recite it with my eyes closed.
m_ex_claymore_02_7,Do I really need to watch it two more times?
m_ex_claymore_02_8,"Of course, you do!"
m_ex_claymore_02_9,And that's exactly what we're aiming for;
m_ex_claymore_02_10,being able to recite it with your eyes closed!
m_ex_claymore_02_11,"You're doing great, keep it up!"
m_ex_claymore_02_12,Only two more times to go!
m_ex_claymore_02_13,Hang in there!
m_ex_claymore_02_14,"Oh, and starting tomorrow,"
m_ex_claymore_02_15,I want you to closely follow the schedule that we've made for you.
m_ex_claymore_02_16,So be sure to check the schedule that I sent.
m_ex_claymore_02_17,"That applies to you too, Coach!"
m_ex_claymore_02_18,Huh? Me too?
m_ex_claymore_02_19,That's right! We're all in this together.
m_ex_claymore_02_20,"I'll be right there along with you both,"
m_ex_claymore_02_21,so neither of you has to worry.
m_ex_claymore_02_22,I've just checked the schedule.
m_ex_claymore_02_23,Is that even humanly possible?
m_ex_claymore_02_24,It's nothing but practice
m_ex_claymore_02_25,from morning till the evening.
m_ex_claymore_02_26,"It might seem overwhelming at first,"
m_ex_claymore_02_27,"but if you keep at it, you get used to it."
m_ex_claymore_02_28,"In fact,"
m_ex_claymore_02_29,"I went with the most lax schedule of the three options, hehe."
m_ex_claymore_02_30,What?
m_ex_claymore_02_31,You've got to be kidding me.
m_ex_claymore_02_32,"At any rate,"
m_ex_claymore_02_33,I'll give it a try.
m_ex_claymore_02_34,"Things are about to get real,"
m_ex_claymore_02_35,so you and Pal
m_ex_claymore_02_36,better be mentally prepared.
m_ex_claymore_02_37,"Starting from tomorrow, it's gonna be hell!"
m_ex_claymore_02_38,Why do I have to join...?
m_ex_claymore_02_39,"Hehe, that's the spirit!"
m_ex_claymore_02_40,I'll be sure to mentally prepare myself as well!
m_ex_claymore_02_41,No one's even listening to me...
m_ex_claymore_03_1,"Well,"
m_ex_claymore_03_2,turns out the name you chose for this group was rather prescient.
m_ex_claymore_03_3,We defeated Marin!
m_ex_claymore_03_4,"Quite easily, as a matter of fact."
m_ex_claymore_03_5,"I knew you could do it, Milk!"
m_ex_claymore_03_6,I believed in you all the way!
m_ex_claymore_03_7,"Great job, everyone."
m_ex_claymore_03_8,"Pal, Clay."
m_ex_claymore_03_9,I wanted to thank you both for taking the time
m_ex_claymore_03_10,to walk me through everything.
m_ex_claymore_03_11,"Actually, that reminds me."
m_ex_claymore_03_12,"Are you gonna come watch, Pal?"
m_ex_claymore_03_13,Watch what?
m_ex_claymore_03_14,The competition that Rewind's gonna be a part of.
m_ex_claymore_03_15,I got invited too.
m_ex_claymore_03_16,Why don't we go together?
m_ex_claymore_03_17,Sure.
m_ex_claymore_03_18,Oh my goodness! You guys have no idea
m_ex_claymore_03_19,how happy it makes me to hear that both of you are coming!
m_ex_claymore_03_20,Thank you for taking time away from your busy schedules.
m_ex_claymore_03_21,"We're going in with awfully high expectations,"
m_ex_claymore_03_22,"so we're expecting one heck of a show,"
m_ex_claymore_03_23,"aren't we, Pal?"
m_ex_claymore_03_24,"Oh yes, we're very much looking forward to it."
m_ex_claymore_03_25,Hehe.
m_ex_claymore_03_26,"You know that I'll do my best,"
m_ex_claymore_03_27,"but when you put it that way,"
m_ex_claymore_03_28,it does feel like a lot of pressure...
m_ex_claymore_03_29,However!
m_ex_claymore_03_30,"You felt this way before, and you were able to overcome it, weren't you, Milk?"
m_ex_claymore_03_31,I'll just think of you and Coach
m_ex_claymore_03_32,and give it my all.
m_ex_claymore_03_33,Sounds good!
m_ex_claymore_03_34,See you there.
m_ex_claymore_03_35,Good luck.
m_ex_claymore_03_36,"You've got this, Clay."
m_ex_claymore_03_37,"Thanks, guys!"
m_ex_rewind_01_1,Coach! Coach!
m_ex_rewind_01_2,What is it?
m_ex_rewind_01_3,We have a question.
m_ex_rewind_01_4,"When you see a glass that's filled half-way with water,"
m_ex_rewind_01_5,what would you call it?
m_ex_rewind_01_6,A glass that's half full.
m_ex_rewind_01_7,A glass that's half empty.
m_ex_rewind_01_8,A glass with water in it.
m_ex_rewind_01_9,Whoa!
m_ex_rewind_01_10,I knew that's how you'd think!
m_ex_rewind_01_11,Hehe.
m_ex_rewind_01_12,My thoughts exactly!
m_ex_rewind_01_13,Hmm...
m_ex_rewind_01_14,"That's a fair answer,"
m_ex_rewind_01_15,but don't you think it makes you feel a bit...
m_ex_rewind_01_16,disappointed?
m_ex_rewind_01_17,?
m_ex_rewind_01_18,?
m_ex_rewind_01_19,?
m_ex_rewind_01_20,What a unique answer!
m_ex_rewind_01_21,I never thought of that.
m_ex_rewind_01_22,"I suppose if you think about it rationally,"
m_ex_rewind_01_23,that's a perfectly valid response.
m_ex_rewind_01_24,Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
m_ex_rewind_01_25,Bay and I were looking at a cup
m_ex_rewind_01_26,"filled with water,"
m_ex_rewind_01_27,and it got us thinking about how everyone might perceive it differently.
m_ex_rewind_01_28,"Turns out,"
m_ex_rewind_01_29,Bay and I have entirely different opinions on it.
m_ex_rewind_01_30,Isn't that fascinating?
m_ex_rewind_01_31,I think the glass is half full.
m_ex_rewind_01_32,But I think
m_ex_rewind_01_33,it's half empty.
m_ex_rewind_01_34,"We were curious what you would think,"
m_ex_rewind_01_35,but now we know.
m_ex_rewind_01_36,Then what do you think when you see a glass that's completely full?
m_ex_rewind_01_37,"I think... that's a whole lotta water, hehe."
m_ex_rewind_01_38,"A full glass looks really nice, don't you think?"
m_ex_rewind_01_39,"Personally,"
m_ex_rewind_01_40,it makes me feel a bit uneasy.
m_ex_rewind_01_41,It looks like it could spill at any moment.
m_ex_rewind_01_42,I see.
m_ex_rewind_01_43,"What about you, Coach?"
m_ex_rewind_01_44,I'd just think about how much I want to drink it.
m_ex_rewind_01_45,Huh?
m_ex_rewind_01_46,Hmm...
m_ex_rewind_01_47,Why do you say so?
m_ex_rewind_01_48,I'm parched at the moment.
m_ex_rewind_01_49,!
m_ex_rewind_01_50,!!
m_ex_rewind_01_51,I guess we kept you for too long T_T
m_ex_rewind_01_52,Hurry and get some water to drink!
m_ex_rewind_01_53,We've got to get back to practice anyway.
m_ex_rewind_01_54,See you later.
m_ex_rewind_02_1,"Coach,"
m_ex_rewind_02_2,what do you think is the most important part of cheerleading?
m_ex_rewind_02_3,Engaging with the audience.
m_ex_rewind_02_4,Putting on a great performance.
m_ex_rewind_02_5,"Oh, so that's what you were thinking?"
m_ex_rewind_02_6,Hehe.
m_ex_rewind_02_7,That makes me feel great since that's what I'm in charge of!
m_ex_rewind_02_8,I can see why you'd feel that way.
m_ex_rewind_02_9,Bay's amazing performances
m_ex_rewind_02_10,are the crux of Rewind.
m_ex_rewind_02_11,"When Bay gets on the stage, she shines like no one else."
m_ex_rewind_02_12,"I had no idea you felt that way, Coach!"
m_ex_rewind_02_13,"Oh, right."
m_ex_rewind_02_14,I was just mindlessly scrolling through the internet
m_ex_rewind_02_15,when I saw people arguing about which mattered more: audience engagement or the actual performance.
m_ex_rewind_02_16,It was like super intense! T_T
m_ex_rewind_02_17,"If you dared to go against the grain, they'd tear you apart in a heartbeat!"
m_ex_rewind_02_18,What do you guys think?
m_ex_rewind_02_19,That's easy.
m_ex_rewind_02_20,That's easy.
m_ex_rewind_02_21,It's both.
m_ex_rewind_02_22,It's both.
m_ex_rewind_02_23,Whoa!
m_ex_rewind_02_24,"Whoa, our minds are totally in sync!"
m_ex_rewind_02_25,"Feels awesome, hehe!"
m_ex_rewind_02_26,It's only natural since we're a team.
m_ex_rewind_02_27,"If either of us disagreed with the other,"
m_ex_rewind_02_28,it would have been really difficult for us to work as a team.
m_ex_rewind_02_29,"You're so cool when you're breaking things down, Bay."
m_ex_rewind_02_30,"Anyway,"
m_ex_rewind_02_31,Rewind is gonna become a team
m_ex_rewind_02_32,"that doesn't lack in any area,"
m_ex_rewind_02_33,"be it audience engagement,"
m_ex_rewind_02_34,or the actual performances themselves.
m_ex_rewind_02_35,That's right!
m_ex_rewind_02_36,Any audiences who come to see our shows
m_ex_rewind_02_37,won't be disappointed.
m_ex_rewind_02_38,We've been practicing super hard every day!
m_ex_rewind_02_39,I'm looking forward to seeing you perform.
m_ex_rewind_02_40,Thanks! Hehe!
m_ex_rewind_02_41,We can't wait for you to see it!
m_ex_rewind_02_42,"We recently started practicing a new routine,"
m_ex_rewind_02_43,so we'll give you a sneak peek soon.
m_ex_rewind_02_44,We'd love to hear your honest feedback.
m_ex_rewind_02_45,"Sure, contact me anytime."
m_ex_rewind_02_46,"I knew we could count on you, Coach!"
m_ex_rewind_02_47,Thanks!
m_ex_rewind_02_48,"Yeah, thanks, Coach."
m_ex_rewind_02_49,We'll contact you soon.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_1,"Are you busy,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_2,Mister?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_3,"No, why?"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_4,Well...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_5,I wanted to get your thoughts on something.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_6,What is it?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_7,Huh?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_8,Isn't it obvious?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_9,Are you talking about your swimsuit?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_10,That's right!
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_11,How was it seeing it in person? :3
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_12,"I mean, we've already seen everything there is to see of each other,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_13,"but a swimsuit is a whole different story, don't you think?"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_14,I liked it.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_15,It was a bit too revealing for me.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_16,^_^
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_17,That's the kind of answer I'm looking for.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_18,"You're quite lucky, you know."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_19,Getting a front row seat to
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_20,the boss of Hedonia in a swimsuit.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_21,Really?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_22,"Playing innocent now, are we?"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_23,^_^
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_24,You're adorable.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_25,The real question is: are you okay with it?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_26,Hmm?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_27,What do you mean?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_28,Wearing a swimsuit might undermine your authority.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_29,Hmm...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_30,Mister.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_31,"If my authority could be so easily undermined by a mere piece of clothing,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_32,I wouldn't have attained this position in the first place.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_33,I see.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_34,I could have my subordinates quivering in fear
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_35,even in my birthday suit.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_36,Would you like me to show you?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_37,"No, I think I get the idea."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_38,Good ^_^
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_39,"I appreciate your concern,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_40,but I assure you that I have full control over my subordinates.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_41,You needn't worry about me.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_01_42,"Okay, I won't."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_1,"Mister,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_2,don't tell me you forgot?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_3,?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_4,The promise we made at the bar.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_5,What promise?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_6,Sigh... I knew this would happen.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_7,"Last time we ran into each other at the bar,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_8,a certain someone promised we'd go swimming.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_9,The only thing I recall is drinking a whole bunch.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_10,Hm...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_11,"It was kinda cute, actually."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_12,"To be fair, I expected you not to remember"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_13,since you were three sheets to the wind.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_14,Is today the day we're supposed to hang out?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_15,That's right.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_16,I already booked the swimming pool.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_17,"Apparently, I'm the only one who remembered."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_18,"Sorry, I'll head over there right now."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_19,Can I come a bit later?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_20,That's more like it!
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_21,"I want us to make the most of our time together,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_22,so I have my men stand guard around the perimeter.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_23,You don't have to worry about anyone disturbing us.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_24,Is that really necessary?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_25,It's for anyone who might dare to bother us.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_26,"If someone barges in on our private time, I might not be able to hold back."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_27,Hmm?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_28,Fine. Do whatever you want.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_29,"If you're late, I won't wait for you."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_30,Is there anything that I should bring?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_31,Just bring that body of yours.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_32,Come again?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_33,Just bring yourself.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_34,I've already prepared everything that we'll need.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_35,I wouldn't want my man inconvenienced in any way.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_36,"... We're just going swimming, right?"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_37,"What's this, Mister?"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_38,I won't bite.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_39,"If you feel tired, you can take a nap in the room I booked for us."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_40,Unless...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_41,you have something else in mind.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_42,No. I'll be right there.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_43,"All right,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_44,come fully prepared.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_02_45,"We're going to have a blast, so get ready to enjoy yourself."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_1,Mister.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_2,"Tell me,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_3,is that cream you gave me last time sunscreen?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_4,It is. Why?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_5,Hmm...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_6,Are you sure?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_7,"The more I put on, the darker my skin seems to get."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_8,Hold on.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_9,"Glancing at the top of my desk,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_10,I see the bottle of sunscreen.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_11,I must have accidentally sent the tanning cream Anis bought on a whim...
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_12,I think what you've got there is tanning cream.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_13,I knew it.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_14,But it's not a big deal.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_15,"Sorry, I'll send you the sunscreen later."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_16,"Rather than that,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_17,why don't you make it up to me?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_18,How?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_19,"I've already applied the cream,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_20,but there are still some areas I can't quite reach.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_21,Surely someone like yourself could lend a hand?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_22,"Sure, I'll help out."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_23,Can't you ask one of your subordinates?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_24,That's what I wanted to hear.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_25,"I'm always thrilled to have an excuse to meet you,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_26,and a private meeting at that!
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_27,Where should we meet?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_28,Hmm?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_29,"If you're not into it,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_30,I won't force you.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_31,But I can't promise what will happen to the hand
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_32,of any subordinate who dares lay a hand on me.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_33,"... Okay, I'll do it."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_34,"All right, there are too many prying eyes out here,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_35,so I'll book a hotel room.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_36,I wouldn't want you to be in a tough spot ^_^
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_37,Aren't I thoughtful?
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_38,"You're the best. Thanks, Rosanna."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_39,Let's kick things off with a shot of whiskey and set the mood right.
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_40,"Btw, it's Room 706."
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_41,"I'll be waiting,"
m_ex_rosanna_chicocean_03_42,so don't be late.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_1,What's going on here?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_2,Why is this group chat so dead?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_3,Don't tell me you made a separate chat
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_4,just for those who had fun up on the surface?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_5,Haha!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_6,"I didn't think you'd catch on that quick,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_7,but I guess I underestimated you.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_8,What?! So I was right?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_9,Moran actually being perceptive?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_10,It seems the world has turned topsy-turvy.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_11,What the... What do you mean by that?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_12,"Oh, right!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_13,Cadet!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_14,Cadet!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_15,Did you really create another group chat without me?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_16,Answer me!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_17,"No, everyone's just pulling your leg."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_18,Sorry. I'll invite you next time.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_19,What?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_20,So it's true?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_21,"And... you're in on it, Cadet?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_22,You betrayed my trust!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_23,"Just kidding, hehe."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_24,Really???
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_25,"Hahaha, I knew it!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_26,I knew you'd be loyal to me!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_27,"Whether Mister's jesting or not,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_28,the fact that we all went up to the sea with him remains unchanged.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_29,"You do realize that, right?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_30,"All of us, with the notable exception of one nincompoop."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_31,Oh come on!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_32,Seriously?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_33,"You were so unwilling at that time,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_34,and now you're ganging up on me?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_35,"Moran,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_36,how about calming down a little?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_37,I can feel your frantic energy even from the messages.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_38,"Yeah, don't make a fuss."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_39,"If you're itching that badly to join us,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_40,I'll have a kiddie pool set up right in front of the Peony Association today.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_41,You can splash around there to your heart's content.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_42,Oh! Does that mean you'll add me to that group chat?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_43,I'll think about it.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_44,"All right, I'll be waiting!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_45,"Moran, wait."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_46,...
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_47,There is no response from Moran.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_48,She must have really felt left out.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_49,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_50,why don't you go keep her company?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_51,"Whoa, that's quite unlike you, Sakura."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_52,I can still vividly recall
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_53,"your relentless attempts to keep Mister all to yourself, you know."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_54,She took the reins for all three organizations
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_55,while we were away.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_56,So she must have had a hell of a time.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_57,Consider this me repaying her for overseeing Seimeikai.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_58,Oh?
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_59,"In that case, I don't owe her a thing anymore :3"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_60,"Anyhow, I should get someone to set up that pool."
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_61,"Mister,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_62,"Mister, I've got a favor to ask!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_63,Go and cheer up that goofball for me.
m_ex_underworldqueen_05_64,Sure.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_1,Mister!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_2,Remember those photos we took together?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_3,"I'm going to send them in this group chat, okay?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_4,I'll DM mine to you.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_5,Seriously?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_6,"I get that they're personal,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_7,but I wanna see them too!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_8,I can't do that.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_9,These photos contain precious memories between {AccountData.NickName}-kun and me.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_10,Photos? What photos?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_11,What are you guys talking about?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_12,Hmm...
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_13,"Surely you don't think you're the only one with personal photos, do you?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_14,I happen to have quite a few myself.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_15,"Actually, intimate would be a better word to describe them."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_16,"Isn't that right, Mister?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_17,...
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_18,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_19,Is that true?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_20,"No, I've only taken photos with you."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_21,I was fair and took pictures with everyone.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_22,"I knew I could count on you to tell the ""truth""."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_23,You're such a bad liar.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_24,"I've always admired your honesty, Mister."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_25,"As for you, Sakura,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_26,you shouldn't try to keep Mister all to yourself.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_27,You're too petty-minded for that kind of ploy.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_28,"Hey, what in the heck is going on?!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_29,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun is someone who will achieve great things in the future,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_30,so I'll let this slide.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_31,Is this some kind of weird role play you two are doing?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_32,"You're really getting into this whole ""prim and proper wife"" role."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_33,"It's becoming rather irksome, I must admit."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_34,Think what you wish.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_35,"My actions won't change, no matter what."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_36,"Everyone, calm down."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_37,Don't get too big for your britches just because I let you borrow my man.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_38,You're the one
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_39,who said we shouldn't keep him for ourselves.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_40,What?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_41,Hey!!!!!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_42,What
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_43,in the world
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_44,are you all
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_45,talking about?!?!?!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_46,I'm so lost!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_47,We were talking about some photos we took together.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_48,Photos? Is that all?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_49,I've taken plenty with Cadet.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_50,Are you seriously fighting over this?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_51,"Jeez, sometimes you two can be so immature."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_52,"Don't you think so, Cadet? Hahahaha!"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_53,"Can it,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_54,moron.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_55,I concur with that sentiment.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_56,"You don't have a clue as to what's going on here,"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_57,so we don't need any feedback from the peanut gallery.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_58,"Besides, you're the immature one."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_59,What are you on about?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_60,We don't have any gallery that exhibits peanuts!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_61,Sigh...
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_62,Hearing such idiotic talk just made me lose all interest.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_63,Let's continue this conversation another time.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_64,I've got to get going.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_65,"Me too. See you around, Mister."
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_66,Huh?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_67,Where are you guys going?
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_68,Hey!!!
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_69,"Cadet, did you leave too?"
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_70,... I think it'd be best not to acknowledge Moran right now.
m_ex_underworldqueen_06_71,Hey!!!!!!!
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_1,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_2,How are you faring in this stifling heat?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_3,I see that you've changed your profile picture.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_4,"Ah, you noticed!"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_5,It's a photo I took at the beach a while ago.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_6,Do you like it?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_7,"Yeah, it turned out really well."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_8,Hehe.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_9,"I'm glad I changed it, then."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_10,"Anyway,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_11,have you been adapting well to the change in seasons?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_12,"It's a little warm, but I'm good otherwise."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_13,That's a relief.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_14,I was worried that
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_15,"the heat might wear you out,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_16,but it seems I don't have anything to worry about.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_17,"How about you, Sakura?"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_18,I'm also enjoying the change of seasons.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_19,From the fragrant black tea
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_20,"to the iced barley tea,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_21,from the pink cherry blossoms
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_22,"to the blue hydrangeas,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_23,the only thing that hasn't changed
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_24,is my affection for you.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_25,You've changed a little yourself.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_26,Sorry?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_27,What do you mean?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_28,You've become more proactive lately.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_29,Hehe.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_30,Is that so?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_31,I do find myself somewhat exhilarated.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_32,I was going to go for a walk and enjoy the summer breeze.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_33,I was hoping you'd join me.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_34,Of course.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_35,That's great.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_36,"If that is so,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_37,let's not waste time and dive straight into summer.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_38,I've prepared some shaved ice at the pavilion outside the mansion.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_39,I'll be right there!
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_01_40,"Haha, hurry before it melts."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_2,are you asleep?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_3,"No, not yet."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_4,That's a relief.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_5,I was worried I might wake you up.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_6,"I couldn't sleep, so I was flipping through my photo album"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_7,and thought of you.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_8,What are you up to?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_9,Thinking about you.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_10,Hehe.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_11,"I know you're only teasing me,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_12,but it still nice to hear that.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_13,"Anyway, I was looking at the photos of the sand castle you and I built"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_14,when you popped into my mind.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_15,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_16,Do you know what cherry blossoms and sand castles have in common?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_17,Hmm... I'm not sure.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_18,Both are ephemeral in nature.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_19,"Just as cherry blossoms fall with time,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_20,so will sand castles eventually crumble.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_21,But...
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_22,But...?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_23,That won't happen to the sand castle
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_24,you and I built.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_25,It will last forever in this photo
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_26,and in my heart.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_27,Hehe.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_28,"Do you think if we watch the cherry blossoms together,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_29,they'll remain in bloom forever as well?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_30,Of course.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_31,You didn't even hesitate.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_32,You are truly admirable.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_33,"Oh my goodness,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_34,look at the time!
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_35,I always lose track of time whenever I talk to you.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_36,Me too.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_37,I am truly delighted that we share the same sentiment.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_38,"All right, talk to you next time."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_02_39,Rest well.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_1,"{AccountData.NickName}-kun,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_2,do you prefer
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_3,the traditional clothes I usually wear
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_4,or the swimsuit I wore at the beach?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_5,"Traditional clothes, I'd say."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_6,Swimsuits are the way to go for summer.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_7,I see.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_8,Traditional clothes are indeed more elegant
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_9,and more fitting for the head of an organization.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_10,I see.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_11,It was nice getting to wear a swimsuit.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_12,They feel particularly special since they're designed for the summer season.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_13,"Anyway, I asked because I was curious about your preference."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_14,Thanks for answering my question.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_15,"Now that I think about it, it's rather regrettable to have to settle for just one."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_16,You are more greedy than I had anticipated.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_17,"Then again, it's only natural to yearn for what is beyond reach."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_18,"Just as the flowers in bloom differ with the seasons,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_19,it might also be nice for you to wait and see the different sides of me.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_20,"Oh,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_21,your answer reminded me of something.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_22,What is it?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_23,Something that Anis told me
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_24,when we were all at the beach.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_25,"She said that if you wear a swimsuit under your usual clothes,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_26,it really gives you a leg up on the competition.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_27,Do you know what she meant by that?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_28,Um... it's a little difficult to explain.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_29,Would you be so kind as to provide an explanation?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_30,"You don't need to know, honestly."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_31,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_32,I'm the head of a large organization.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_33,"For that, maintaining an edge is essential."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_34,"If I can gain an advantage simply by changing my attire,"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_35,I will gladly do so.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_36,Actually... Anis meant it in the sense you'd be more appealing to men.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_37,Excuse me?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_38,"Particularly when you have some ""private meetings"" with them."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_39,Sakura doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_40,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_41,I'm really sorry.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_42,"I must confess, I hadn't anticipated it to have such a meaning."
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_43,It's okay. I understand.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_44,{AccountData.NickName}-kun.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_45,"Do you feel that way, too, when you see me in that attire?"
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_46,That's... a bit of an awkward question to answer.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_47,Okay.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_48,I'll keep that in mind.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_49,Hmm?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_50,Good bye for now.
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_51,Sakura?
m_ex_sakura_bloominsummer_03_52,Sakura does not reply.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_1,Ein has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_2,??
m_ex_juveniledays_01_3,"Teacher,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_4,it's me!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_5,Ein.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_6,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_7,It's a secret group chat
m_ex_juveniledays_01_8,to keep our correspondence away from prying eyes.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_9,"Anyway,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_10,I've been curious about something.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_11,If there are some absurd rumors going around about someone close to you
m_ex_juveniledays_01_12,"and everyone else is actually buying into it,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_13,what would you do?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_14,What kind of rumors?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_15,Hmm...
m_ex_juveniledays_01_16,"For example,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_17,"how Zwei's been cheating all this time,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_18,or that Rei is actually 200 years old.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_19,"You know, stuff like that. LOL."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_20,That's just ridiculous.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_21,"I know, right?"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_22,How can people
m_ex_juveniledays_01_23,believe such absurd rumors?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_24,It doesn't make any sense at all!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_25,Most rumors tend to be like that.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_26,"So what would you do,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_27,Teacher?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_28,"I'd believe in my friend, of course."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_29,Exactly!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_30,That's what I thought.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_31,"But when I asked Zwei for proof that she didn't cheat,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_32,she refused
m_ex_juveniledays_01_33,and just said that
m_ex_juveniledays_01_34,I should trust her.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_35,So I did.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_36,"She seems kinda peeved at the whole thing,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_37,"but that's not my fault, is it?"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_38,That sounds about right.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_39,Maybe she's just feeling a bit awkward.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_40,I see.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_41,"So it has to do with her attitude, then?"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_42,Hmm... what should I do about that temper of hers...
m_ex_juveniledays_01_43,What do you mean?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_44,"By asking her for proof, Zwei feels that you're doubting her."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_45,!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_46,"She probably doesn't appreciate having to defend herself, least of all to you."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_47,!!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_48,"Oh, okay!"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_49,"I get it... I think, hehe."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_50,"Anyway, I know I've been asking you a lot of random questions."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_51,So thanks for answering.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_52,"If I'm ever bored or have a question, I'll send you a message here."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_53,Wouldn't it be better to simply send me a private message?
m_ex_juveniledays_01_54,No way! Private messages are too public.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_55,"If you create a secret group chat, you won't receive any notifications,"
m_ex_juveniledays_01_56,so you don't have to worry about anyone else seeing it.
m_ex_juveniledays_01_57,I don't want anyone to know about this. It's kind of embarrassing!
m_ex_juveniledays_01_58,"Lol, got it."
m_ex_juveniledays_01_59,Hehe :D
m_ex_juveniledays_01_60,"See you later, Teacher."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_1,Teacher.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_2,Teacher!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_juveniledays_02_4,I just got back to the dormitory
m_ex_juveniledays_02_5,and suddenly felt that
m_ex_juveniledays_02_6,this is
m_ex_juveniledays_02_7,like a dream!!!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_8,What are you talking about?
m_ex_juveniledays_02_9,Rupee.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_10,The fact that
m_ex_juveniledays_02_11,I have a personal relationship with her
m_ex_juveniledays_02_12,is insane!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_13,She even asked me to come over sometime!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_14,"OMG, is this for real?!"
m_ex_juveniledays_02_15,"Hehe, I can see you're quite happy."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_16,You bet!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_17,You have no idea how obsessed I used to be with Rupee.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_18,"I didn't say anything before because I didn't want to make a fuss,"
m_ex_juveniledays_02_19,but I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Lupin myself!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_20,"At first, I looked her up because I liked her designs,"
m_ex_juveniledays_02_21,"but the more I saw of her, the more charming I found her to be."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_22,"Before I knew it, I was obsessed."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_23,Rupee does have a certain charm that draws people in.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_24,"Absolutely, Teacher."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_25,You've got a good eye.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_26,"Honestly, if it were anyone else, they'd be way out of your league,"
m_ex_juveniledays_02_27,but Rupee is a perfect match for you.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_28,That's the best compliment I can offer.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_29,"So, consider it an honor."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_30,"Hahahaha, thanks."
m_ex_juveniledays_02_31,"All right,"
m_ex_juveniledays_02_32,you really should get some rest.
m_ex_juveniledays_02_33,That applies to me as well!
m_ex_juveniledays_02_34,Bye!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_1,"Teacher,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_2,whatcha doing?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_3,Are you busy???
m_ex_juveniledays_03_4,"Yes, I'm working. Why?"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_5,Ah...
m_ex_juveniledays_03_6,I'm boooooooored.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_7,:(
m_ex_juveniledays_03_8,You still couldn't give her the ribbon?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_9,Nope.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_10,"And since I said I'd wait,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_11,"I can't exactly keep bugging her about it, either."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_12,"I've got no idea what's going on,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_13,but I can't exactly ask her.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_14,"So yeah, I've been going to the karaoke alone lately."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_15,"At first, I sang alone for an hour straight."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_16,"It was fun since there was no one bugging me,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_17,"but after a couple times,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_18,it started to get real boring real fast.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_19,"There's nobody to shake a tambourine to my killer tune,"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_20,and no one to bust a move with!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_21,How about you and I go to the karaoke together sometime?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_22,OMG!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_23,Really?!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_24,That'd be fantastic!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_25,"Even if you just sat next to me and listened, it'd still be cool."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_26,"But seriously, we gotta sing together!"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_27,"I'm curious about your singing skills, hehe."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_28,You're in for a surprise.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_29,Don't expect too much.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_30,"Whoa, okay!"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_31,I just got an adrenaline rush like you wouldn't believe!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_32,"Aw c'mon, don't throw in the towel already."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_33,You don't have to be a crooner to have fun at the karaoke.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_34,Having fun is what really matters.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_35,"Am I right, or am I right?"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_36,"So, when should we go?"
m_ex_juveniledays_03_37,How about after work?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_38,When do you finish work?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_39,In 30 minutes?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_40,An hour?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_41,2 hours?
m_ex_juveniledays_03_42,Hurrrrryyyyyyyyyy!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_43,"If you keep that up, I'm not going."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_44,!!
m_ex_juveniledays_03_45,"Okay, I'll be quiet."
m_ex_juveniledays_03_46,Let me know when you're done.
m_ex_juveniledays_03_47,Will do.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_1,Teacher!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_2,What's up?
m_ex_juveniledays_04_3,Hehehe.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_4,"I don't think I'll be using this group chat anymore,"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_5,so it's kinda bumming me out.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_6,That's why I decided to reach out.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_7,"I guess we don't really need this secret group chat anymore, huh?"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_8,Yep!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_9,"I'm not lonely anymore without friends,"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_10,so I won't be
m_ex_juveniledays_04_11,coming to you to vent as much.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_12,So you're abandoning me now that you have friends?
m_ex_juveniledays_04_13,Teacher!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_14,How can you say that?!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_15,That's just plain sad!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_16,I told you before.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_17,"To me, a friend is someone I like"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_18,and love to hang out with them at all my favorite spots.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_19,"I like you, Teacher."
m_ex_juveniledays_04_20,And I've got plenty of places that I want to go with you.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_21,So believe me when I say that you're my friend.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_22,"Do I get a ribbon as well, then?"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_23,Hehehe.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_24,"Of course, I can get you one!"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_25,You interested?
m_ex_juveniledays_04_26,"After all you've done for me,"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_27,giving you a ribbon is nothing.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_28,"When I graduate and become a full-time designer at Rushae,"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_29,I'll make sure to tailor a suit for you.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_30,I can't wait.
m_ex_juveniledays_04_31,"Just wait, when that time comes,"
m_ex_juveniledays_04_32,any clothes emblazoned with my name
m_ex_juveniledays_04_33,will fetch a fortune! :3
m_ex_juveniledays_04_34,"Anyway, make sure you swing by the school often."
m_ex_juveniledays_04_35,"I'll be waiting for you, along with the others."
m_ex_juveniledays_04_36,"All right, I will."
m_ex_juveniledays_04_37,Bye bye!
m_ex_juveniledays_04_38,Ein left the group chat.
m_ex_ein_01_1,"Hiya, Teacher!"
m_ex_ein_01_2,Hiya?
m_ex_ein_01_3,"Hehe,"
m_ex_ein_01_4,I'm Ein.
m_ex_ein_01_5,"I'm from the School Circle Squad,"
m_ex_ein_01_6,Class P.
m_ex_ein_01_7,"Actually,"
m_ex_ein_01_8,I bet you already knew all that.
m_ex_ein_01_9,I think this is the first time
m_ex_ein_01_10,I've ever sent you a message.
m_ex_ein_01_11,It all feels so unfamiliar.
m_ex_ein_01_12,It sure is.
m_ex_ein_01_13,You really feel all that?
m_ex_ein_01_14,Mhmm!
m_ex_ein_01_15,I sure do!
m_ex_ein_01_16,I'm really not used to
m_ex_ein_01_17,texting you like this.
m_ex_ein_01_18,Maybe I'll get used to it as we go along.
m_ex_ein_01_19,"Anyway,"
m_ex_ein_01_20,when are you coming back to our school again?
m_ex_ein_01_21,"Not sure, why?"
m_ex_ein_01_22,Why else?
m_ex_ein_01_23,Because I want to spend time with you!
m_ex_ein_01_24,You do?
m_ex_ein_01_25,Of course!
m_ex_ein_01_26,I always have a blast hanging out with you.
m_ex_ein_01_27,"And even if they don't say it explicitly,"
m_ex_ein_01_28,"Rei,  Zwei,"
m_ex_ein_01_29,and even Miss Marciana
m_ex_ein_01_30,all look forward to
m_ex_ein_01_31,you coming back.
m_ex_ein_01_32,They get a lot out of spending time with you as well.
m_ex_ein_01_33,"So,"
m_ex_ein_01_34,you really ought to set a date for your next visit.
m_ex_ein_01_35,How about today?
m_ex_ein_01_36,I'm free after school is out.
m_ex_ein_01_37,Today?
m_ex_ein_01_38,Yeah!
m_ex_ein_01_39,I should be free by the time you finish school.
m_ex_ein_01_40,Yessssss! So you're coming today?
m_ex_ein_01_41,No takebacks!
m_ex_ein_01_42,I'll be waiting for you!
m_ex_ein_01_43,I'm gonna go tell the others!
m_ex_ein_02_1,Teacher.
m_ex_ein_02_2,Teacher!
m_ex_ein_02_3,Teaaaaccchhheeerrrrr!
m_ex_ein_02_4,Yes?
m_ex_ein_02_5,"It's break time and I'm bored,"
m_ex_ein_02_6,so I wanted to text you.
m_ex_ein_02_7,"I figured you'd be busy and wouldn't respond,"
m_ex_ein_02_8,but I'm in luck!
m_ex_ein_02_9,You're bored? Why don't you hang out with the rest?
m_ex_ein_02_10,Well...
m_ex_ein_02_11,"Rei is taking a nap,"
m_ex_ein_02_12,and Zwei is studying.
m_ex_ein_02_13,"I can understand wanting to rest, like Rei,"
m_ex_ein_02_14,but Zwei is incredible.
m_ex_ein_02_15,Using her free time to go over her study material...
m_ex_ein_02_16,She's the paragon of a model student.
m_ex_ein_02_17,I could never be like that!
m_ex_ein_02_18,Teacher.
m_ex_ein_02_19,Were you like that when you were a student?
m_ex_ein_02_20,Not sure. I don't remember.
m_ex_ein_02_21,*Gasp*
m_ex_ein_02_22,You already don't remember
m_ex_ein_02_23,the times when you were a student?
m_ex_ein_02_24,Maybe studying wasn't really your thing back then.
m_ex_ein_02_25,"That would explain why you don't remember much, hehe."
m_ex_ein_02_26,You got me.
m_ex_ein_02_27,That's not it.
m_ex_ein_02_28,Hahaha!
m_ex_ein_02_29,I knew it!
m_ex_ein_02_30,I felt a similar vibe coming from you.
m_ex_ein_02_31,Huh?
m_ex_ein_02_32,So were you a model student too?
m_ex_ein_02_33,How disappointing...
m_ex_ein_02_34,"Anyway,"
m_ex_ein_02_35,I still have two more classes left.
m_ex_ein_02_36,I'm dying of boredom over here.
m_ex_ein_02_37,"Hang in there, you're nearly done."
m_ex_ein_02_38,"Okay, fiiiiiine."
m_ex_ein_02_39,I'll stop whining.
m_ex_ein_02_40,The bell just rang too.
m_ex_ein_02_41,Argh! I don't wanna go to class!
m_ex_ein_02_42,"al.o,fna,sndfalof"
m_ex_ein_02_43,I'll text you again after class.
m_ex_ein_03_1,"Teacher,"
m_ex_ein_03_2,"I know this is a bit random,"
m_ex_ein_03_3,but do you know anywhere fun to hang out?
m_ex_ein_03_4,The karaoke bar.
m_ex_ein_03_5,At a café.
m_ex_ein_03_6,I go there nearly every day.
m_ex_ein_03_7,What can you do there?
m_ex_ein_03_8,Is there anywhere else?
m_ex_ein_03_9,Why are you asking all of a sudden?
m_ex_ein_03_10,My friends want to do something else
m_ex_ein_03_11,"other than karaoke,"
m_ex_ein_03_12,but I can't think of anything.
m_ex_ein_03_13,"I figured since you're a social guy,"
m_ex_ein_03_14,I could ask you for suggestions.
m_ex_ein_03_15,How about a game cafe?
m_ex_ein_03_16,Huh?
m_ex_ein_03_17,A game cafe?
m_ex_ein_03_18,What do you do there?
m_ex_ein_03_19,Play tabletop games.
m_ex_ein_03_20,What kind?
m_ex_ein_03_21,Jenga.
m_ex_ein_03_22,Backgammon.
m_ex_ein_03_23,I'm going to look it up.
m_ex_ein_03_24,Hmm...
m_ex_ein_03_25,Looks like a dexterity game.
m_ex_ein_03_26,Rei would be good at it.
m_ex_ein_03_27,"Wait a moment, I'm going to look it up."
m_ex_ein_03_28,Hmm...
m_ex_ein_03_29,This game looks like a battle of wits.
m_ex_ein_03_30,Zwei would have an advantage for sure.
m_ex_ein_03_31,This sounds fun!
m_ex_ein_03_32,There are a whole bunch of games to choose from.
m_ex_ein_03_33,I wanna go there and check it out!
m_ex_ein_03_34,"You'll come too, won't you, Teacher?"
m_ex_ein_03_35,"You're not busy today, are you?"
m_ex_ein_03_36,"Nope, I can tag along."
m_ex_ein_03_37,That's great!
m_ex_ein_03_38,But I don't want to play the game you just mentioned.
m_ex_ein_03_39,"I'd lose straight away, ha."
m_ex_ein_03_40,I'll look up some more games to play.
m_ex_ein_03_41,"Class is about to end soon,"
m_ex_ein_03_42,"so I'll see you later, Teacher!"
m_ex_zwei_01_1,"Hello,"
m_ex_zwei_01_2,Teacher.
m_ex_zwei_01_3,It's Zwei.
m_ex_zwei_01_4,"I'm a student at M.M.R. Vocational School,"
m_ex_zwei_01_5,and a member of the School Circle Squad.
m_ex_zwei_01_6,"Hello, Zwei."
m_ex_zwei_01_7,"This is the first time I'm sending you a personal message,"
m_ex_zwei_01_8,so I just wanted to say hi.
m_ex_zwei_01_9,"Anyway, I ought to get going."
m_ex_zwei_01_10,"Sure, keep in touch."
m_ex_zwei_01_11,"By the way,"
m_ex_zwei_01_12,is it okay if I contact you
m_ex_zwei_01_13,even if I don't have any special going on?
m_ex_zwei_01_14,Of course.
m_ex_zwei_01_15,And can I ask you questions
m_ex_zwei_01_16,that I don't know the answer to?
m_ex_zwei_01_17,"Sure, feel free to."
m_ex_zwei_01_18,Zwei doesn't respond for a moment.
m_ex_zwei_01_19,"Okay then, I do have a question."
m_ex_zwei_01_20,If the coefficient of the highest term of the cubic function f(x) is 1
m_ex_zwei_01_21,and it satisfies the following condition
m_ex_zwei_01_22,"regarding the function f(x), f(k-1)"
m_ex_zwei_01_23,Wait a minute.
m_ex_zwei_01_24,Yes?
m_ex_zwei_01_25,Is this math you're throwing at me?
m_ex_zwei_01_26,Oh...
m_ex_zwei_01_27,Is that a bit too sudden?
m_ex_zwei_01_28,"Okay, then I'll ask you about another subject."
m_ex_zwei_01_29,It's a question about the Ark's history:
m_ex_zwei_01_30,"The achievements of the current Missilis CEO, Syuen,"
m_ex_zwei_01_31,can be summarised into three major points.
m_ex_zwei_01_32,The first is...
m_ex_zwei_01_33,Hold on.
m_ex_zwei_01_34,Yes?
m_ex_zwei_01_35,History's not exactly my strong suit either...
m_ex_zwei_01_36,Hmm...
m_ex_zwei_01_37,What subject should I ask you about then?
m_ex_zwei_01_38,How about combat?
m_ex_zwei_01_39,Okay.
m_ex_zwei_01_40,When encountering a Rapture in the city...
m_ex_zwei_01_41,Ah!
m_ex_zwei_01_42,?
m_ex_zwei_01_43,Miss Marciana just arrived.
m_ex_zwei_01_44,I'll go ask her.
m_ex_zwei_01_45,"Thanks, Teacher."
m_ex_zwei_01_46,You're welcome to ask me too...
m_ex_zwei_01_47,Zwei doesn't respond.
m_ex_zwei_02_1,Teacher!
m_ex_zwei_02_2,Teacher!!
m_ex_zwei_02_3,... Zwei?
m_ex_zwei_02_4,"Yes, who else?!"
m_ex_zwei_02_5,"Teacher,"
m_ex_zwei_02_6,"I know this is sudden,"
m_ex_zwei_02_7,but there's something I have to say to you.
m_ex_zwei_02_8,I really like you!
m_ex_zwei_02_9,"This is Ein, isn't it?"
m_ex_zwei_02_10,Wha...?!
m_ex_zwei_02_11,How did you know?
m_ex_zwei_02_12,You have a very distinct way of speaking.
m_ex_zwei_02_13,Really?
m_ex_zwei_02_14,"You're quite the detective, Teacher! Haha."
m_ex_zwei_02_15,"Anyway, a super rare occurrence is happening right before my very eyes."
m_ex_zwei_02_16,"Like, super duper uncommon."
m_ex_zwei_02_17,What is it?
m_ex_zwei_02_18,Zwei is...
m_ex_zwei_02_19,dozing off!
m_ex_zwei_02_20,So I snagged her phone from her pocket
m_ex_zwei_02_21,"and now I'm messaging you on Bla, haha!"
m_ex_zwei_02_22,!#_)(!#%CNSAGF
m_ex_zwei_02_23,Teacher!
m_ex_zwei_02_24,When are you coming to school?
m_ex_zwei_02_25,Rei?
m_ex_zwei_02_26,Yep! Lololol
m_ex_zwei_02_27,"Ein was making a scene,"
m_ex_zwei_02_28,so I took the phone away
m_ex_zwei_02_29,just in case Zwei wakes up.
m_ex_zwei_02_30,"So, when are you visiting us again?"
m_ex_zwei_02_31,Zwei has even been telling us how much she misses ya#R±VM
m_ex_zwei_02_32,"My apologies, Teacher."
m_ex_zwei_02_33,"I dozed off for a moment,"
m_ex_zwei_02_34,and it seems Rei and Ein were up to no good.
m_ex_zwei_02_35,Sorry for causing any confusion.
m_ex_zwei_02_36,"Haha, it's okay."
m_ex_zwei_02_37,Ugh.
m_ex_zwei_02_38,You can ignore everything
m_ex_zwei_02_39,that they wrote.
m_ex_zwei_02_40,Okay.
m_ex_zwei_02_41,...
m_ex_zwei_02_42,Teacher?
m_ex_zwei_02_43,Yes?
m_ex_zwei_02_44,Please stop by the school when you have time.
m_ex_zwei_02_45,Rei and Ein really miss you.
m_ex_zwei_02_46,I kind of miss you too.
m_ex_zwei_02_47,"Sure, I'll come by whenever I can."
m_ex_zwei_02_48,Thanks.
m_ex_zwei_02_49,"Well, I've got to get back to studying."
m_ex_zwei_03_1,"Teacher,"
m_ex_zwei_03_2,I have a question.
m_ex_zwei_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_zwei_03_4,I would appreciate it if you could respond seriously.
m_ex_zwei_03_5,"As a student,"
m_ex_zwei_03_6,is it really necessary for us to
m_ex_zwei_03_7,review all the previous materials we've learned?
m_ex_zwei_03_8,Absolutely. Reviewing is essential.
m_ex_zwei_03_9,"Not only is it necessary to review, but you've also got to prepare well in advance for any exams."
m_ex_zwei_03_10,As I thought.
m_ex_zwei_03_11,"I knew you would say that, Teacher."
m_ex_zwei_03_12,"On that, you and I agree."
m_ex_zwei_03_13,Only after you've reviewed and prepared extensively
m_ex_zwei_03_14,can you truly say you fully understand any given lesson.
m_ex_zwei_03_15,Um...
m_ex_zwei_03_16,"Could I ask one more thing, if it's alright?"
m_ex_zwei_03_17,Sure.
m_ex_zwei_03_18,I want you to take this question seriously as well.
m_ex_zwei_03_19,If you were teaching a class
m_ex_zwei_03_20,"and noticed a student eating snacks,"
m_ex_zwei_03_21,what would you do?
m_ex_zwei_03_22,I would confiscate the snacks at once.
m_ex_zwei_03_23,"I'm okay with students drinking water, but nothing more."
m_ex_zwei_03_24,My thoughts exactly.
m_ex_zwei_03_25,Snacking during class
m_ex_zwei_03_26,shows a complete lack of respect for the teacher.
m_ex_zwei_03_27,I see.
m_ex_zwei_03_28,So you don't consider water to be a snack?
m_ex_zwei_03_29,That's correct.
m_ex_zwei_03_30,Thanks for answering.
m_ex_zwei_03_31,"As I expected, I won."
m_ex_zwei_03_32,You won?
m_ex_zwei_03_33,"Ein, Rei, and I were betting on what your answer would be,"
m_ex_zwei_03_34,and the winner gets to decide which dessert we'll be trying
m_ex_zwei_03_35,at the new pastry shop that opened up near the school.
m_ex_zwei_03_36,"Haha, I see."
m_ex_zwei_03_37,They're both saying that I cheated since I made such a fuss about you taking the question seriously.
m_ex_zwei_03_38,"But when people ask you a question, it's only right to treat it seriously, isn't that right?"
m_ex_zwei_03_39,That's true.
m_ex_zwei_03_40,I knew it.
m_ex_zwei_03_41,"Anyway, thank you for the answers, Teacher."
m_ex_zwei_03_42,The others and I are off to go eat some dessert.
m_ex_zwei_03_43,I'll let you know how it was.
m_ex_zwei_03_44,"Okay, enjoy your dessert."
m_ex_colorless_01_1,Ein has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_01_2,Ein has invited Rei to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_01_3,Ein has invited Zwei to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_01_4,Ein has invited Privaty to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_01_5,??
m_ex_colorless_01_6,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_colorless_01_7,"""Embark On a Journey""?"
m_ex_colorless_01_8,Hehe.
m_ex_colorless_01_9,"Since we're going on a trip tomorrow,"
m_ex_colorless_01_10,I'm just checking
m_ex_colorless_01_11,if we need anything before then.
m_ex_colorless_01_12,Did you really have to invite the Commander and me too?
m_ex_colorless_01_13,"Come now,"
m_ex_colorless_01_14,"Miss Privaty,"
m_ex_colorless_01_15,you should try and warm up to us a bit more.
m_ex_colorless_01_16,There are no messages for a while.
m_ex_colorless_01_17,Miss Privaty?
m_ex_colorless_01_18,Oh.
m_ex_colorless_01_19,Sorry.
m_ex_colorless_01_20,I dropped my phone.
m_ex_colorless_01_21,"Hehe, you're so clumsy."
m_ex_colorless_01_22,Excuse me?
m_ex_colorless_01_23,That's not why I dropped my phone! I...
m_ex_colorless_01_24,"Ugh, never mind!"
m_ex_colorless_01_25,"You're weird, Miss Privaty."
m_ex_colorless_01_26,Arrrrggghhh!
m_ex_colorless_01_27,"Anyway,"
m_ex_colorless_01_28,Teacher.
m_ex_colorless_01_29,Can you tell us
m_ex_colorless_01_30,where are we going tomorrow?
m_ex_colorless_01_31,???
m_ex_colorless_01_32,??!?!?!?!
m_ex_colorless_01_33,Ein.
m_ex_colorless_01_34,I was wondering why Teacher was invited as well.
m_ex_colorless_01_35,Was it to ask that?
m_ex_colorless_01_36,I'm dying to know!
m_ex_colorless_01_37,"Yeah, I'm really curious as well!"
m_ex_colorless_01_38,So where are we going?
m_ex_colorless_01_39,We don't know either.
m_ex_colorless_01_40,"Oh, come on now!"
m_ex_colorless_01_41,Don't keep us in the dark!
m_ex_colorless_01_42,Tell us!
m_ex_colorless_01_43,We honestly don't know.
m_ex_colorless_01_44,We haven't heard anything.
m_ex_colorless_01_45,Hmm...
m_ex_colorless_01_46,There must be a reason why they're hiding it from us.
m_ex_colorless_01_47,It must be a freaking awesome place
m_ex_colorless_01_48,if they're trying to keep it under wraps like this.
m_ex_colorless_01_49,"Oh boy,"
m_ex_colorless_01_50,I bet we're in for a real surprise!
m_ex_colorless_01_51,Is there somewhere in particular that you want to go?
m_ex_colorless_01_52,An amusement park!
m_ex_colorless_01_53,Amusement park!
m_ex_colorless_01_54,A historical site.
m_ex_colorless_01_55,Wow!
m_ex_colorless_01_56,"I have to give you props, Zwei."
m_ex_colorless_01_57,You're always so true to yourself XD
m_ex_colorless_01_58,??
m_ex_colorless_01_59,"Anyway, I'll be snapping tons of pics on this trip"
m_ex_colorless_01_60,"and posting them here,"
m_ex_colorless_01_61,"so keep your eyes peeled for them, all right?"
m_ex_colorless_01_62,How exciting!
m_ex_colorless_01_63,Be careful out there.
m_ex_colorless_01_64,Have fun.
m_ex_colorless_01_65,We will!
m_ex_colorless_01_66,See you when we get back.
m_ex_colorless_01_67,See you soon.
m_ex_colorless_02_1,??? has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_02_2,??? has invited Rapi to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_02_3,?
m_ex_colorless_02_4,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_colorless_02_5,FieldTripPlan.txt
m_ex_colorless_02_6,FieldTripSchedule.jpg
m_ex_colorless_02_7,Who are you?
m_ex_colorless_02_8,"Rapi, go ahead and download the files for now."
m_ex_colorless_02_9,"Are you sure, Commander?"
m_ex_colorless_02_10,Yes.
m_ex_colorless_02_11,Got it.
m_ex_colorless_02_12,What's this?
m_ex_colorless_02_13,What are students doing up on the surface?
m_ex_colorless_02_14,Privaty and I are on our way to them right now.
m_ex_colorless_02_15,...
m_ex_colorless_02_16,Understood.
m_ex_colorless_02_17,I'll assemble all available personnel and join you.
m_ex_colorless_02_18,Thanks.
m_ex_colorless_02_19,"Whoever you are, can you give me the exact coordinates?"
m_ex_colorless_02_20,mmrvocationalschool.com/watch-gps/download?from=details
m_ex_colorless_02_21,I tap the link.
m_ex_colorless_02_22,Downloading files.
m_ex_colorless_02_23,33%... 67%... 100%.
m_ex_colorless_02_24,Download complete.
m_ex_colorless_02_25,I've got the real-time coordinates.
m_ex_colorless_02_26,Thanks for your cooperation.
m_ex_colorless_02_27,"I'll see you soon,"
m_ex_colorless_02_28,Commander.
m_ex_colorless_03_1,Marciana has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_03_2,Marciana has invited Privaty to join the group.
m_ex_colorless_03_3,"Thank you once again,"
m_ex_colorless_03_4,for everything.
m_ex_colorless_03_5,Marciana!
m_ex_colorless_03_6,Are you okay?
m_ex_colorless_03_7,I'm fine.
m_ex_colorless_03_8,They've given me permission
m_ex_colorless_03_9,"to move around freely now,"
m_ex_colorless_03_10,but I'm more concerned about the students than myself.
m_ex_colorless_03_11,This kind of thing must never happen again.
m_ex_colorless_03_12,Exactly!
m_ex_colorless_03_13,That's why
m_ex_colorless_03_14,I made this group chat.
m_ex_colorless_03_15,What do you mean?
m_ex_colorless_03_16,So that the teachers in charge of Class P
m_ex_colorless_03_17,can share information
m_ex_colorless_03_18,in order to protect the students.
m_ex_colorless_03_19,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_colorless_03_20,"As teachers,"
m_ex_colorless_03_21,"we're responsible for what's happening at the school,"
m_ex_colorless_03_22,not the students.
m_ex_colorless_03_23,"Isn't that right, Commander?"
m_ex_colorless_03_24,That's right. You remembered what I told you.
m_ex_colorless_03_25,Of course.
m_ex_colorless_03_26,How could I forget?
m_ex_colorless_03_27,"Anyway,"
m_ex_colorless_03_28,"I look forward to working with you in the future, Marciana."
m_ex_colorless_03_29,The pleasure is all mine.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_1,Teacher.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_2,Please be honest.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_3,About what?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_4,"When you were in school,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_5,what kind of student were you?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_6,Why do you ask all of a sudden?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_7,"Me and the others were talking about you,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_8,"and I got curious, hehe."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_9,"I figured that you were a bit of a troublemaker,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_10,in light of how good-looking you are.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_11,I can envision you wearing your uniform slightly askew
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_12,and hanging out with all the pretty girls.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_13,No way.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_14,Teacher is a renowned military officer with a prestigious reputation.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_15,That means he was almost certainly at the top of his class.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_16,"Of course, there are some students who excel in their studies even while having a good time."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_17,"However, considering Teacher's personality,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_18,I don't think that's the case.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_19,Maybe he was just an ordinary student
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_20,who liked to eat and sleep?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_21,Is that your definition of ordinary?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_22,Of course!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_23,"Doing things in moderation, but not overdoing it:"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_24,"attending class,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_25,eating and enjoying some leisure time.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_26,"Perfectly ordinary, like me! Haha."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_27,"I'd say eating and leisure time are more important for you, Rei."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_28,H ye!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_29,Hehehehe.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_30,Even your typos are cute.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_31,"So,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_32,"what kind of student were you, Teacher?"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_33,I don't remember much about my student days.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_34,Huh?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_35,Really?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_36,Oh...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_37,I see.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_38,Is it a sore subject?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_39,"No, it's not that."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_40,"Oh,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_41,well that's good.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_42,Teacher.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_43,How about this then?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_44,What kind of student do you think you were?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_45,"Yeah, you can tell us that!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_46,"If you don't remember, take an educated guess."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_47,When I was a student...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_48,"Maybe I was a little bit of a troublemaker, hehe."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_49,I was well-behaved and focused on my studies.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_50,There was absolutely nothing noteworthy about me.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_51,I knew it!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_52,You don't seem like the type who would blend into the crowd.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_53,You're well aware of the effect you have on ladies.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_54,I see.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_55,That's a bit unexpected.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_56,"Given your current position,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_57,I would have thought you'd have been diligent in your studies.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_58,"Wow, you're so lucky."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_59,That means you were a natural at studying and could afford to have fun at the same time.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_60,No way!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_61,You're pulling our legs.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_62,"Haha, keep in mind that I'm only guessing here."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_63,"Anyway, I won the bet,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_64,"so you owe me a parfait, Zwei, Rei."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_65,How can you consider that a win?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_66,We have no idea if that's what Teacher was really like.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_67,Of course that's what he was like!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_68,He just admitted it to us.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_69,Weird.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_70,I thought for sure he would have been an ordinary student.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_71,I knew it.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_72,You and I are the same when it comes to that.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_73,"Ugh, no fun at all."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_74,Why would you imagine your past self as someone so boring?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_75,What's the point of living if all you do is study?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_76,Right!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_77,"You've got to at least sleep a bit in class,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_78,and eat some good snacks to make memories.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_79,"That's why he went on to become a Commander,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_80,and our teacher.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_81,"Oh yeah, I guess you're right, hehe."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_82,"Haha, keep in mind that I'm only guessing here."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_83,"Anyway, I won the bet,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_84,so you both owe me a parfait.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_85,How can you consider that a win?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_86,We have no idea if that's what Teacher was really like.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_87,Of course that's what he was like.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_88,He just admitted it to us.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_89,Weird.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_90,I thought for sure he would have been an ordinary student.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_91,Hahaha!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_92,I knew it!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_93,The most ordinary students are the happiest.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_94,Sleep whenever you're tired.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_95,Eat whenever you're hungry.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_96,Study whenever it crosses your mind.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_97,That's hardly what I'd call ordinary.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_98,"At most, maybe he was somewhat ordinary in his study habits."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_99,No no no.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_100,That's just plain ol' boring.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_101,"If he was a normal student, he would have had a few girlfriends here and there."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_102,Hmm...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_103,Hmm...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_104,"I guess it depends on how you define ""ordinary""..."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_105,"Haha, keep in mind that I'm only guessing here."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_106,"Anyway, I won the bet,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_107,so I'm gonna order a whole bunch of parfaits.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_108,How can you consider that a win?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_109,We have no idea if that's what Teacher was really like.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_110,Of course it was.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_111,Teacher just said as much.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_112,Aw man... my money...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_113,Hmm...
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_114,Oh well.
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_115,Um... hello?
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_116,"Oh, jeez!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_117,"I almost forgot that you were here, Teacher."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_118,Sorry about that. Thanks for all the help!
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_119,"Ein, Rei, let's go talk in our own group chat."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_120,"Hehe, sure."
m_ex_schoolcircle_01_121,"For some reason, I feel a bit sad at being left out..."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_1,"Teacher,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_2,I just got some new homework assigned to me.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_3,Could you help me?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_4,"Me too, me too!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_5,And me!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_6,All three of you?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_7,Yes.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_8,"We have to interview someone who we respect,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_9,but as it turns out...
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_10,We all respect the same person.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_11,And who may that be?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_12,Hahaha!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_13,"You don't have to pretend like you don't know, Teacher."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_14,I'd say it's pretty obvious at this point.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_15,"I'm pretty sure at this point, anyone could tell that we're talking about you."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_16,"Being a senior, I respect myself most of all,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_17,"but we're not allowed to do our reports on ourselves,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_18,"so I had to choose you, Teacher."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_19,"I obviously respect you in many ways, Teacher,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_20,so I wanted to have you be the subject of this assignment.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_21,"Ein, you have someone else that you respect more than me, don't you?"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_22,"Oh, you know me, Teacher."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_23,"I don't just respect Rupee, I adore her."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_24,But what can I say?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_25,Contacting her about this
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_26,would be totally embarrassing!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_27,And it's not with me?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_28,That just means I'm more comfortable around you!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_29,"... Anyway, what are the questions?"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_30,I'll start.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_31,Why did you choose this profession?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_32,To reclaim the surface.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_33,Because it's cool.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_34,I see.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_35,"More or less the answer I expected,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_36,but it's still quite touching hearing it from you personally.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_37,"You're so cool, Teacher!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_38,Hmm...
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_39,I see.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_40,I can't say that's quite the answer I was expecting.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_41,LOL.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_42,"All right, next up is my question:"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_43,How do you relieve stress?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_44,I eat snacks.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_45,I read books.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_46,"Yeah,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_47,munching on snacks is the best
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_48,whenever you're feeling stressed.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_49,That's why I'm always grazing during class.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_50,That's not exactly the healthiest coping mechanism.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_51,But I need it!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_52,... Fine.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_53,Hahaha.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_54,"Oh,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_55,really?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_56,Bit of a boring answer...
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_57,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_58,"Gosh, you're no fun."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_59,Are you sure you're not an AI of some kind?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_60,"For me, I found this answer quite satisfactory."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_61,Now then!
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_62,"Last but not least, my question."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_63,Do you have a girlfriend right now?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_64,?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_65,That wasn't on the questionnaire we received.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_66,I know.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_67,"That questionnaire was dull as dirt,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_68,so I changed it.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_69,I'm curious myself.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_70,"Do you have a girlfriend, Teacher?"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_71,Of course I do.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_72,No.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_73,I figured as much.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_74,Who is it? Is it someone I know?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_75,Can you show us a picture of her sometime?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_76,I'm really curious.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_77,"Haha, I'll think about it."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_78,You don't?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_79,That's unexpected.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_80,Any chance I've got a shot at the title after I graduate?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_81,Ein.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_82,What?
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_83,"Are you planning on vying for the position as well, Zwei?"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_84,No.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_85,That's not it...
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_86,Don't you dare bust my chops about this.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_87,*Sigh*...
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_88,"Anyway,"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_89,"thank you for helping us today, Teacher."
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_90,You were very helpful.
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_91,"Yeah, we're bound to get good grades on this assignment!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_92,"Thanks, Teacher!"
m_ex_schoolcircle_02_93,Sure thing.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_1,Phantom has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_2,Phantom has invited Quency to join the group.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_3,Phantom has invited Miranda to join the group.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_4,Hm.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_5,That should be everyone.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_6,What's this now?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_7,You made a chat group?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_8,Corecet.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_9,"I figurec it might be difficult to cocntact you sometimes,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_10,so I made a gropu chat just in case.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_11,I have a question!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_12,"How come the name is spelled
""Thiefves of Justice"" instead of
""Thieves""?"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_13,Isn't that obvious?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_14,"We can't let our true identities be
 known,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_15,"so she purposely garbled the name to
keep it hidden."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_16,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_17,Cool!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_18,No.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_19,I just didn't have time to run spellcheck.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_20,Oh...
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_21,That's cool too!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_22,LOL
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_23,"I see you're nothing if not honest, 
Phantom."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_24,"I don't think we're in any danger of 
being discovered, ha."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_25,"Yeah, totally!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_26,Miranda and I are going to Area B.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_27,Are you doing all rightt?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_28,"Oh sure, Instructor and I are fine."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_29,"We'll be arriving at the destination
soon."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_30,"Once we arrive, we'll send you a test 
message."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_31,Okay.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_01_32,Please be careful.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_1,Is evreryone okay?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_2,"It doesn't seem like anyone is in a 
greast ppossition to deal with 
messages,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_3,so I'll be brief.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_4,"Thanks to Quency, I narrowly escaaped with my life."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_5,"She is a mster escape artist,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_6,so I told her to run.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_7,"Uhnfortunately, Miranda was caught by Novel and Quiry."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_8,"Miranda is a police officer thogh, so I'm sure she'll be fine."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_9,"You all are the ones I'm worried about 
the nost."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_10,"Before Quency ran off,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_11,"she said she woud  go lookig for you,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_12,so you should be seeing her soon.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_13,"I wil lfind the ring, no matter what."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_14,"In the meantime, stay safe and keep yourself hidden."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_15,"Also,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_16,"I would like to express my gratytude 
once again"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_17,for you all trusting in me and following me here.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_18,"Well, I ought to get going."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_19,"Phantom, I'm here."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_20,I found him!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_21,"Instructor was still in the room where 
we first got separated, thank 
goodness."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_22,... Phantom?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_23,"Phantom, are you there?"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_24,Hmm...
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_25,Guess she isn't there.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_26,"That was an awful lot of writing for 
someone who scurried off in such a 
hurry."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_27,"Anyway, don't forget what I told you, 
Phantom!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_28,"Go straight, and then at the 
intersection with three openings, 
go right."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_29,Then right again.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_30,"Go up, take a left, and reach out your 
hand."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_31,Then you'll be at the corridor you need to be in.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_02_32,See you later!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_1,"Hey there, guys."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_2,"I felt bad about not being able to give 
a proper goodbye earlier."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_3,Did you all return the ring safely?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_4,We did.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_5,"It is a bit disadpointing, though."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_6,"It would have bgeen ice if you'd been 
there with us."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_7,That's okay!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_8,"The main thing is that you all 
succeeded!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_9,"The owner was over the moon when 
we returned the ring."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_10,"It was enough to make you feel all 
warm and fuzzy inside."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_11,"I guess there is something to say for 
living a life full of good deeds, ha."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_12,"Well, now that our mission is complete,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_13,I suppose I'll leave this group chat.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_14,Leaving so soon?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_15,That's too bad.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_16,Yeah!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_17,"The A.C.P.U. wants me back straight 
away so I can get started on my report."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_18,"Before I did that though, I wanted to 
give you all a proper farewell."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_19,Miranda left the group chat.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_20,"Wow,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_21,she really left.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_22,"This group chat doesn't have much 
meaning if all four of us aren't 
together,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_23,so I might as well leave too.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_24,"Thanks for the fun times, everyone!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_25,Bye!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_26,Take care of yourself.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_27,You too!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_28,Quency left the group chat.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_29,Moinseur.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_30,"You might as well leavfe, too."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_31,Do you want me to leave?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_32,That's not what I mean.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_33,"However, even if our actions are just,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_34,it would be prudent not to leave behind any evidence of our past deeds.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_35,"It'll be fine. I'd like to keep it as a 
memento."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_36,Very well.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_37,"If that is how you fell, I won't stop you."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_38,It was a pleasure wor king with you.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_03_39,Likewise.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_1,Phantom has invited Quency to join the group.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_2,Phantom has invited Miranda to join the group.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_3,Hmm?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_4,What's this?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_5,"Oh, hahaha. I just read the notice."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_6,"Hey,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_7,cool!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_8,It's the Thieves of Justice's group chat!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_9,"If you all saw the notice, you'll know that"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_10,the time has come.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_11,"Thieves of Justice,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_12,can we band together once again?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_13,Uh...
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_14,"I'm on board,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_15,"but when you're trying to say something cool,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_16,you should really try to get the spelling right.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_17,Oh.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_18,Just a moment.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_19,It's hardly cool when you can't make heads or tails of the title.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_20,I think it's totally cool!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_21,Anyone who seeks justice is cool in my eyes!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_22,"Yeah, that's right!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_23,"Thieves of Justice,"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_24,can we band together once again?
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_25,That's more like it!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_26,"Yeah, we're back in business!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_27,I'll ask Poli if I can join you.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_28,I don't think she'll allow it.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_29,You never know!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_30,"This is all in the name of justice, after all."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_31,"I just finished writing my 17th report, so I'll go ask her."
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_32,Good.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_33,We'll meett in the same location as before. Same time.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_34,Got it!
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_35,"Haha, okay!"
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_36,Here we go again.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_37,It looks like we'll be using this group chat for a while yet.
m_ex_phantomthiefvsdetective_04_38,"Then again, it's always fun to sit back and watch as things unfold. I might as well enjoy it."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_1,Rumani has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_2,Rumani has invited Folkwang to join the group.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_3,Rumani has invited Epinel to join the group.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_4,Is that everyone?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_5,??
m_ex_lifeagain_01_6,Coach is here too?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_7,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_8,I created this group chat
m_ex_lifeagain_01_9,"because I think we'll have loads to discuss in the near future,"
m_ex_lifeagain_01_10,what with Nadia's condition and her rehabilitation.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_11,"If any of you have anything to discuss,"
m_ex_lifeagain_01_12,feel free to say it in this group chat.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_13,Gotcha!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_14,Okay.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_15,I'm curious as to what kind of person Nadia is!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_16,Me too.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_17,"Coach, you've seen Nadia before, haven't you?"
m_ex_lifeagain_01_18,What's she like?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_19,I heard she's about my age.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_20,She's cute.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_21,She's a bit touchy.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_22,"Cute, you say?"
m_ex_lifeagain_01_23,"Well, if she's around Epinel's age, I can see why you'd feel that way about her."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_24,Touchy?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_25,I guess that's unavoidable at her age.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_26,"Then again, I guess that has its own unique charm too."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_27,"And let's not forget, Epinel is cute as well! Hehe."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_28,Huh?
m_ex_lifeagain_01_29,You're right about that. Epinel is cute.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_30,You bet she is!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_31,I really hope Nadia can overcome this trauma.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_32,Totally!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_33,That's the most important thing ever!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_34,Let's all do our best to help her get past this.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_35,All right!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_36,I'll do whatever I can to help!
m_ex_lifeagain_01_37,Me too.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_38,"Thank you, everyone."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_39,I'll pitch in as well.
m_ex_lifeagain_01_40,"Thank you, Gym Rat."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_41,"I'm sure Nadia's rehabilitation will go smoothly, thanks to all of you lending a hand."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_42,"It won't be easy, but do everything you can to take care of her."
m_ex_lifeagain_01_43,"That goes for you as well, Gym Rat."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_1,"Rumani,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_2,are you okay?
m_ex_lifeagain_02_3,Don't worry about the gym.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_4,Epinel and I are holding down the fort.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_5,"Yeah,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_6,don't worry about things over here.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_7,Thank you.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_8,Where are you right now?
m_ex_lifeagain_02_9,I just stepped outside for some fresh air.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_10,Would you like us to tag along?
m_ex_lifeagain_02_11,No.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_12,"I appreciate your concern,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_13,"but right now, I need some time alone"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_14,to sort out my thoughts.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_15,"Okay,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_16,"but if you're having a hard time and need someone,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_17,feel free to reach out anytime.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_18,We'll go straight to where you are.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_19,That's right. We'll head over right away!
m_ex_lifeagain_02_20,"We've got your back, Rumani!"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_21,We know how hard you've worked for this.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_22,"Yeah, we know all about it."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_23,"Argh, I'm so angry!"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_24,"If they're going to write an article, the least they could do is get their facts straight."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_25,What's the point of doing an interview when the article's already out?
m_ex_lifeagain_02_26,"By then, the public will have already made up their minds."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_27,It's just so frustrating >:(
m_ex_lifeagain_02_28,"It's happened more than a few times,"
m_ex_lifeagain_02_29,but it never gets any easier.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_30,"Oh well, what's done is done."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_31,Thank you all for your concern.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_32,I'll reach out later.
m_ex_lifeagain_02_33,"In the meantime, stay strong and keep working hard for me."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_34,"You too, Rumani."
m_ex_lifeagain_02_35,"Yeah, hang in there!"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_1,I can't thank you all enough.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_2,"Thanks to all of your combined efforts,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_3,Nadia was able to stand up again.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_4,"No,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_5,"it was you who did all the hard work, Rumani."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_6,"Yeah,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_7,"you really gave it your all, Rumani!"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_8,"The moment Nadia stood up and hugged you,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_9,I could barely hold back my tears.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_10,I don't see why you're so emotional. It wasn't that bad.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_11,"Don't lie,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_12,Coach.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_13,I saw you with a runny nose.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_14,Don't be ridiculous.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_15,:/
m_ex_lifeagain_03_16,"You should be honest, Coach."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_17,I was on the edge of tears the whole time.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_18,"Honestly, I'm actually crying right now."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_19,Really?
m_ex_lifeagain_03_20,"All right, let's cry together then :'("
m_ex_lifeagain_03_21,:'(
m_ex_lifeagain_03_22,:'(
m_ex_lifeagain_03_23,Would you two stop it?
m_ex_lifeagain_03_24,Okay.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_25,Okay.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_26,"Anyway, good job, Rumani."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_27,Thanks! :D
m_ex_lifeagain_03_28,"We're just getting started with Nadia's rehab,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_29,"and there's still a long way to go,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_30,but at least there's hope.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_31,Let's keep pushing
m_ex_lifeagain_03_32,until the day Nadia competes in a track and field competition!
m_ex_lifeagain_03_33,"I'll be there with you every step of the way, helping out however I can!"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_34,I'll help as much as I can as well.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_35,"I have to finish what I started, so I'm in."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_36,Nadia is so lucky to
m_ex_lifeagain_03_37,have such dependable people around her.
m_ex_lifeagain_03_38,"Thank you all, for everything you've done."
m_ex_lifeagain_03_39,"There are still many hurdles to overcome until she's ready for a competition,"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_40,"but together, I know we can do it!"
m_ex_lifeagain_03_41,We've got this!
m_ex_lifeagain_03_42,Let's go!
m_ex_lifeagain_03_43,:D
m_ex_lifeagain_04_1,Rumani has invited Nadia to join the group.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_2,I invited you.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_3,Nadia?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_4,"Wow, Nadia!"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_5,Hello.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_6,Hi.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_7,You guys had a group chat this whole time?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_8,"You haven't been bad-mouthin' me in here, have you?"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_9,What are you doing in this group chat?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_10,What? Am I not allowed to join?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_11,That's not what I meant.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_12,Nadia suddenly asked if we had a group chat
m_ex_lifeagain_04_13,and then requested to be added because she had something to say.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_14,"Oh, it's not much."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_15,I just wanted to let you all know that I got first place in the track and field competition today.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_16,No way! You got first place?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_17,"Guess you missed it, huh?"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_18,I was in the lead
m_ex_lifeagain_04_19,from start to finish.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_20,No one overtook me even once the entire time.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_21,Amazing.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_22,"I know, right?"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_23,"You're incredible, Nadia."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_24,I knew you had it in you.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_25,"You've got what it takes, and I'm confident you'll end up surpassing even me one day."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_26,Of course!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_27,That's my dream!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_28,"Haha, I'm sure you can do it!"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_29,I'll certainly try!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_30,"I promise I didn't join this chat just to brag though, haha."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_31,I wanted to say thank you!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_32,"If it weren't for all of you,"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_33,I wouldn't have been able to achieve my dream.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_34,"In a way,"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_35,you all helped me make a fresh start.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_36,So I wanted to say thanks again.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_37,"I'm not very good with words,"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_38,so I can't really think of much else to say other than that.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_39,So...
m_ex_lifeagain_04_40,"Anyway,"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_41,thank you so much!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_42,No one responds to Nadia's messages.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_43,What's going on?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_44,Why isn't anyone responding?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_45,Oh boy...
m_ex_lifeagain_04_46,"Sorry, Rumani just burst out crying..."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_47,??
m_ex_lifeagain_04_48,I'm not crying!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_49,Huh?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_50,Are you really crying?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_51,I'm not!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_52,Folkwang is mistaken.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_53,She has something in her eyes.
m_ex_lifeagain_04_54,Are you at the gym right now?
m_ex_lifeagain_04_55,I'm coming over!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_56,"No, don't come!"
m_ex_lifeagain_04_57,I'll be right there!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_58,I said don't come!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_59,I want to go too!
m_ex_lifeagain_04_60,"If you come here, Gym Rat, I'll make you do 1,000 burpees."
m_ex_lifeagain_04_61,"... Despite my curiosity, I decide it's best not to go."
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_1,Rouge has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_2,Rouge has invited Blanc to join the group.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_3,Rouge has invited Noir to join the group.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_4,"Great,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_5,that should be everyone.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_6,??
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_7,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_8,Luck Charging Room?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_9,I made this temporarily to use until the competition.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_10,"I probably won't be able to come to Coin Rush for a few days,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_11,so it might be hard to meet up with you guys.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_12,"Would it be possible for you two to remotely give my luck a boost,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_13,even if it's just occasionally?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_14,A remote charge?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_15,Is that even possible?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_16,"To be honest, I'm not entirely sure myself."
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_17,Why don't we test it out right now?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_18,Huh?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_19,How do we do it?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_20,Just hold tightly to your phone
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_21,and do what you usually do.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_22,"Okay,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_23,let's try it.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_24,All right!
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_25,Rechaaaarge!
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_26,Rechaaaaaarge!
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_27,"For a while, there is no response from Rouge."
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_28,So? Did it work?
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_29,I used the fortune sticks you suggested last time
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_30,"to test my luck,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_31,but...
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_32,I don't think it worked.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_33,"I keep getting ""Bad Luck"","
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_34,so I guess remote charging doesn't work.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_35,What a shame.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_36,That'd have been super convenient if it did.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_37,"Yeah, it's too bad."
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_38,"Just let us know whenever you need it,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_39,and we'll come over during our break.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_40,"Yeah, it's no trouble."
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_41,Thank you.
m_ex_jinxplayer_01_42,I'll let you know if I really need it.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_1,Thank you
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_2,for doing all this for me.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_3,"You too, Highroller."
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_4,It's all good. This has been fun.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_5,"Yeah, don't mention it."
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_6,We're happy to help!
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_7,But were we even helpful?
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_8,"I noticed you seemed to be struggling more and more as we kept playing,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_9,so I got really worried by the end.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_10,To be honest...
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_11,It wasn't easy
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_12,going up against you two.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_13,I figured as much.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_14,"But it was an enlightening experience,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_15,and I'm really glad that I managed to win at least once by the end.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_16,"Thanks to you all,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_17,I've learned a valuable lesson.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_18,"Luck is a powerful force,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_19,"but if you keep your head down and press forward,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_20,an opening will show itself eventually.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_21,"If it hadn't been for everyone's help,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_22,I might never have realized this.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_23,Hehehe.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_24,I'm glad we could help.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_25,That last round was so nerve-wracking.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_26,It felt like
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_27,you were trying to murder me with your eyes.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_28,"Yeah, if looks could kill!"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_29,"You looked really cool, Rouge."
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_30,Keep that momentum going and win again tomorrow!
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_31,You can do it!
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_32,We'll be cheering you on with all our heart!
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_33,"You have to win, okay?"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_34,"Come see us tomorrow, and we'll recharge your luck."
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_35,We'll give you everything we've got!
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_36,Thank you both.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_37,"To meet your support and expectations,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_38,I'll give it my all in the final.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_39,See you all tomorrow.
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_40,"Good night, Rouge!"
m_ex_jinxplayer_02_41,Sleep well.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_1,"Congrats once again, Rouge!"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_2,"I knew you would win, hehe."
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_3,You were amazing out there!
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_4,I was so worried
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_5,since you hadn't gotten a luck recharge from us.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_6,Turns out I was worried for nothing!
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_7,"Congrats, Rouge!"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_8,Practicing with you two yesterday
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_9,was a big help.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_10,Thank you so much.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_11,"You too, Highroller."
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_12,"If you want to thank me, go easy on me next time we play together."
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_13,Hmm...
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_14,"Unfortunately, that's something I can't do."
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_15,That'd take all the fun out of it.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_16,Losing all the time isn't exactly a blast either...
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_17,Hehe.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_18,"How about we help you out during the game, Pit Boss?"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_19,We can recharge your luck.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_20,"If you're okay with it, Rouge."
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_21,Hmm...
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_22,"Normally, I'd be against it,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_23,but
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_24,I'll make an exception just for today.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_25,Woohoo!
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_26,"Great! Since we have permission,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_27,we'll be right over!
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_28,"Where are you right now, Pit Boss?"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_29,I'm by the Game Zone.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_30,"Let's go, Noir!"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_31,All right!
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_32,"Once I'm done organizing everything over here,"
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_33,I'll join you all.
m_ex_jinxplayer_03_34,"All right, I'll be waiting for you guys."
m_ex_rouge_01_1,"Hello, Highroller."
m_ex_rouge_01_2,"This is Rouge,"
m_ex_rouge_01_3,777 Squad's leader.
m_ex_rouge_01_4,"I wanted to send you a message to say hello,"
m_ex_rouge_01_5,and that I'm looking forward to working with you.
m_ex_rouge_01_6,As am I.
m_ex_rouge_01_7,"There is something I'd like to ask you, however."
m_ex_rouge_01_8,Are you superstitious?
m_ex_rouge_01_9,"I, for example,"
m_ex_rouge_01_10,flip a coin every morning
m_ex_rouge_01_11,to determine my fortune for the day.
m_ex_rouge_01_12,"No, not really."
m_ex_rouge_01_13,I tend to avoid certain numbers.
m_ex_rouge_01_14,Oh.
m_ex_rouge_01_15,That's surprising.
m_ex_rouge_01_16,"Actually, now that I think about it, I suppose that makes sense for someone like you."
m_ex_rouge_01_17,"Oh, I do that as well!"
m_ex_rouge_01_18,"For me, though,"
m_ex_rouge_01_19,the number changes every month.
m_ex_rouge_01_20,"So at the beginning of each month,"
m_ex_rouge_01_21,I try to figure out
m_ex_rouge_01_22,which number I should avoid.
m_ex_rouge_01_23,"Once I figure that out, I'm set for the whole month."
m_ex_rouge_01_24,"So, how's your luck today?"
m_ex_rouge_01_25,"Oh,"
m_ex_rouge_01_26,do you mean the coin flip?
m_ex_rouge_01_27,Why don't you take a guess?
m_ex_rouge_01_28,Heads.
m_ex_rouge_01_29,Tails.
m_ex_rouge_01_30,"Wow,"
m_ex_rouge_01_31,correct!
m_ex_rouge_01_32,I didn't think
m_ex_rouge_01_33,you'd actually get it right.
m_ex_rouge_01_34,You must have good intuition.
m_ex_rouge_01_35,"Unfortunately, that's wrong."
m_ex_rouge_01_36,The coin landed heads side up today.
m_ex_rouge_01_37,"Thanks to that, I was able to start the day feeling refreshed."
m_ex_rouge_01_38,I wish every day could be like today.
m_ex_rouge_01_39,"Oh my,"
m_ex_rouge_01_40,would you look at the time?
m_ex_rouge_01_41,I didn't realize we'd been texting for so long.
m_ex_rouge_01_42,It was fun.
m_ex_rouge_01_43,I'll be in touch again soon.
m_ex_rouge_01_44,Wishing you a day filled with good fortune!
m_ex_rouge_02_1,"Highroller,"
m_ex_rouge_02_2,are you with Blanc and Noir
m_ex_rouge_02_3,by any chance right now?
m_ex_rouge_02_4,"No, why?"
m_ex_rouge_02_5,"Oh,"
m_ex_rouge_02_6,I see.
m_ex_rouge_02_7,Hmm...
m_ex_rouge_02_8,Where could those two have gone?
m_ex_rouge_02_9,"The next performance is about to begin,"
m_ex_rouge_02_10,"but I don't see them in the waiting room,"
m_ex_rouge_02_11,and I can't get a hold of them.
m_ex_rouge_02_12,They're nowhere to be found in Coin Rush.
m_ex_rouge_02_13,"Since they're always wandering off looking for you,"
m_ex_rouge_02_14,I was certain they'd be with you.
m_ex_rouge_02_15,"If they're not with you,"
m_ex_rouge_02_16,this may be a serious problem.
m_ex_rouge_02_17,Could they have gone out to have fun somewhere?
m_ex_rouge_02_18,How about looking for them one more time?
m_ex_rouge_02_19,"No,"
m_ex_rouge_02_20,they would never.
m_ex_rouge_02_21,"After all, they place their performances"
m_ex_rouge_02_22,above all else.
m_ex_rouge_02_23,They would never act so irresponsibly.
m_ex_rouge_02_24,Hmm...
m_ex_rouge_02_25,That may be a good idea.
m_ex_rouge_02_26,"I've been looking for them on my own,"
m_ex_rouge_02_27,"but now that there isn't much time left,"
m_ex_rouge_02_28,I should probably have the staff help me.
m_ex_rouge_02_29,"Oh,"
m_ex_rouge_02_30,just one moment.
m_ex_rouge_02_31,Sure?
m_ex_rouge_02_32,"For a while, there is no response from Rouge."
m_ex_rouge_02_33,Sorry for keeping you waiting.
m_ex_rouge_02_34,I found them.
m_ex_rouge_02_35,Where were they?
m_ex_rouge_02_36,They misread the time.
m_ex_rouge_02_37,"They thought the performance was an hour from now,"
m_ex_rouge_02_38,so they went out to
m_ex_rouge_02_39,get some supplies they needed for the performance.
m_ex_rouge_02_40,"Fortunately, they returned just before the starting time,"
m_ex_rouge_02_41,so I hurried them on stage a moment ago.
m_ex_rouge_02_42,"Whew,"
m_ex_rouge_02_43,that was close.
m_ex_rouge_02_44,I need to pay more attention to this kind of stuff.
m_ex_rouge_02_45,I apologize for causing you unnecessary worry.
m_ex_rouge_02_46,Not at all. Feel free to contact me anytime.
m_ex_rouge_02_47,"Thank you, Highroller."
m_ex_rouge_03_1,"Highroller,"
m_ex_rouge_03_2,do you prefer games
m_ex_rouge_03_3,"with psychological elements,"
m_ex_rouge_03_4,or games that rely purely on skill?
m_ex_rouge_03_5,I prefer having some psychological strategy in the mix.
m_ex_rouge_03_6,I prefer purely skill-based games.
m_ex_rouge_03_7,It looks like we're the same.
m_ex_rouge_03_8,I find them more interesting.
m_ex_rouge_03_9,I see.
m_ex_rouge_03_10,Looks like we're on completely opposite sides.
m_ex_rouge_03_11,I prefer games with some psychological strategy.
m_ex_rouge_03_12,"Why do you prefer them, Rouge?"
m_ex_rouge_03_13,I find it fascinating
m_ex_rouge_03_14,"to observe the subtle changes in someone's expression or behavior,"
m_ex_rouge_03_15,and to see how they react
m_ex_rouge_03_16,in different situations.
m_ex_rouge_03_17,I also enjoy
m_ex_rouge_03_18,seeing their surprise
m_ex_rouge_03_19,when they realize I've seen through their actions.
m_ex_rouge_03_20,"Of course,"
m_ex_rouge_03_21,hiding my expressions
m_ex_rouge_03_22,"while doing so is quite a challenge,"
m_ex_rouge_03_23,but the sense of accomplishment I get from winning
m_ex_rouge_03_24,makes it all worthwhile.
m_ex_rouge_03_25,Maintaining a consistent poker face
m_ex_rouge_03_26,is a small pleasure in and of itself.
m_ex_rouge_03_27,You really do have an innate talent for this.
m_ex_rouge_03_28,I guess so.
m_ex_rouge_03_29,"It's in my nature, I suppose."
m_ex_rouge_03_30,Whenever I compete in games
m_ex_rouge_03_31,"where I get to employ some psychological strategies,"
m_ex_rouge_03_32,I get even more fired up.
m_ex_rouge_03_33,"I think the customers may have taken notice of this,"
m_ex_rouge_03_34,and so they tend to
m_ex_rouge_03_35,avoid playing those types of games with me.
m_ex_rouge_03_36,"As a result, I haven't had the chance to indulge in them lately."
m_ex_rouge_03_37,"So, Highballer,"
m_ex_rouge_03_38,"if you have some time,"
m_ex_rouge_03_39,would you like to come visit Coin Rush
m_ex_rouge_03_40,and play a game with me?
m_ex_rouge_03_41,"Sure, I'll stop by later."
m_ex_rouge_03_42,!
m_ex_rouge_03_43,Thank you!
m_ex_rouge_03_44,I can't wait!
m_ex_rouge_03_45,Take care on your way here.

m_ex_phantom_03_14,and they sayd there's a new cartoon
m_ex_phantom_03_15,called Invincible Thief Warrir.
m_ex_phantom_03_16,"It's al labout the main hero defating vilains, and it's supposed to be raelly fun."
m_ex_phantom_03_17,Have you heared of it?
m_ex_phantom_03_18,"I think the children were talking about the show Chief Warrior, but Phantom misheard them."
m_ex_phantom_03_19,I'll play dumb.
m_ex_phantom_03_20,"No, this is the first time I've heard of it."
m_ex_phantom_03_21,I knewt it!
m_ex_phantom_03_22,This is why oilder people fall behind on tie times.
m_ex_phantom_03_23,"Hey, who are you calling old? :/"
m_ex_phantom_03_24,Those kids were so adonrable.
m_ex_phantom_03_25,I brought them a bucnh of snacks
m_ex_phantom_03_26,and even gave them the mask tha tI use.
m_ex_phantom_03_27,You shoulda have seen them. They were onver the moon! They felt like the real thief warrior.
m_ex_phantom_03_28,What was that about a mask?
m_ex_phantom_03_29,I said I gave them my masjk!
m_ex_phantom_03_30,What do you use that for?
m_ex_phantom_03_31,!
m_ex_phantom_03_32,Er...
m_ex_phantom_03_33,Uh...
m_ex_phantom_03_34,Um...
m_ex_phantom_03_35,Hehe.

m_ex_phantom_03_38,What secret?
m_ex_phantom_03_39,Phwe...
m_ex_phantom_03_40,As a matter of faact...
m_ex_phantom_03_41,When no one is arround...
m_ex_phantom_03_42,Yes?
m_ex_phantom_03_43,I don a mask and preted to be a thievf.
m_ex_phantom_03_44,Ugh... this is so ebmarrasing.
m_ex_phantom_03_45,Oh...
m_ex_phantom_03_46,Are you suprised?
m_ex_phantom_03_47,Very.
m_ex_phantom_03_48,I didn't mean tto keep thigns from you.
m_ex_phantom_03_49,"Honestly, I would have been less surprised if you'd told me you were an actual thief."
m_ex_phantom_03_50,???
m_ex_phantom_03_51,W hat?
m_ex_phantom_03_52,Is me pretenign to bge a thief
m_ex_phantom_03_53,relaly that shockgin?
m_ex_phantom_03_54,I'm not at hief!
m_ex_phantom_03_55,"Hehe, I'm just kidding."
m_ex_phantom_03_56,"Oh,"
m_ex_phantom_03_57,you had me goingg for a sce!
m_ex_phantom_03_58,...
m_ex_phantom_03_59,"Anywa, I hope we can wtch that show togerher at some point."
m_ex_phantom_03_60,"Sure, I'll contact you when I've got some spare time."
m_ex_phantom_03_61,Grreat.
m_ex_phantom_03_62,Cant wait!
m_ex_phantom_03_63,"Phantom is bound to be disappointed when she sees that show,"
m_ex_phantom_03_64,so I think I'll wait a while before contacting her again.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_1,"Instructor, are you free this evening?"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_2,You changed your profile picture.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_3,I knew you'd pick up on that straight away.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_4,What do you think?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_5,Does it look good?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_6,"Yeah, it's pretty."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_7,I think your previous one was nicer.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_8,Oh my goodness! Really?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_9,"You're making my heart flutter, hehe!"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_10,What? Really?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_11,"Just joking, hehe. This new one is really pretty too."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_12,You don't have to placate me with false compliments.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_13,Why were you asking me if I was free tonight?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_14,Can you help me dig another tunnel?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_15,"Usually, I can handle it on my own without any issues,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_16,but I'm having a tough time with this one.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_17,I need someone strong to help me.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_18,"I asked Guilty,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_19,but she said she's busy.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_20,"I've got a business deal scheduled for tomorrow,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_21,so I need to get this done tonight.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_22,What's in it for me?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_23,Hmm...
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_24,"I can't give you any Credit,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_25,but I could grant you three wishes.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_26,Three?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_27,Is that enough?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_28,You can wish for anything you'd like.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_29,"Anything? Okay, I'm in."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_30,??
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_31,What kind of things do you intend on wishing for?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_32,I'm not telling.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_33,"Come on, what is it?"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_34,Tell meeeeee!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_35,I'll tell you once we're done with the tunnel.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_36,"Aw c'mon, I wanna know!"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_37,Fine. I'll come over to the Commander's Room in the evening.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_01_38,See you then.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_1,"Instructor,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_2,I feel like my world is falling apart.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_3,sdafjlkahfwoyr0824
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_4,Boohoo :'(
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_5,Argh!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_6,I'm so annoyed!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_7,What's wrong?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_8,I think I got scammed.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_9,I had a deal scheduled for today.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_10,"Normally, I always meet face to face for these things,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_11,"but today, the person said they couldn't come because they were feeling sick."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_12,So I sent the item to them via courier.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_13,The only thing is they ghosted me the moment they received it!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_14,I've been unable to get in contact with them.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_15,"Every time I call, it says the number no longer exists."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_16,Did I just get played?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_17,Certainly sounds like it.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_18,"Ugh, this is driving me crazy."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_19,That item I gave them was super expensive and hard to find.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_20,"I get that it's partly my fault for being too trusting,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_21,but to take advantage of someone's goodwill like this... it's beyond the pale!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_22,I really was totally clueless.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_23,I was even worried when they told me they were sick!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_24,Why don't we go looking for the scammer?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_25,Huh? How?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_26,"It sounds like they're targeting expensive and rare items, right?"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_27,Yeah.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_28,So let's post similar items under a different account online.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_29,"Right! Once they see those listings, they're sure to try and make another scam."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_30,Why didn't I think of that?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_31,I was so shocked my brain totally blanked out for a second!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_32,"I still have a record of my conversation with them,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_33,so I'll be able to cross-check their address and writing style.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_34,"Once we're positive we've got a match, we'll get your item back from the scammer."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_35,How?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_36,"We're thieves, aren't we?"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_37,You're right!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_38,Getting back what's mine won't be a problem at all!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_39,There's no time to be sitting here wallowing in despair.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_40,We need to set up that bait
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_41,for that rotten scoundrel!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_42,"I was crying a whole bunch earlier, so my eyes are pretty swollen."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_43,"I'm feeling a lot better now though, thanks to you."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_44,"Thanks, Instructor!"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_02_45,I'll let you know when I've caught the scammer.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_1,Instructor!!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_2,I'm getting tired of the mask I've been using.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_3,Can you suggest some new ideas for me?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_4,I'm down for anything!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_5,But it'd be great if it's something that suits me
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_6,and it's cute!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_7,An axolotl mask.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_8,An armadillo mask.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_9,Huh?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_10,Really?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_11,Are you serious?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_12,They're so cute.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_13,??
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_14,"Well,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_15,"I guess so,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_16,but they're not exactly suitable for thieves.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_17,"Plus, that might be a bit of a challenge to make into a mask."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_18,Do you have any other ideas?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_19,"Something animal-related,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_20,and cute!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_21,Like a rabbit or a deer!
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_22,How about an elephant?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_23,How about a hippo?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_24,... Never mind.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_25,There's no point in talking to you about this.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_26,"Hehe, all right, I'll stop. Sorry."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_27,...
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_28,You're so cute when you're frustrated. I couldn't resist teasing you.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_29,Hmph! >.>
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_30,I think a fox mask would suit you nicely.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_31,A fox?
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_32,Hmm... That is pretty cute.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_33,Okay then.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_34,I'll try making a fox mask.
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_35,"I'm not sure when it'll be completed,"
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_36,"but when it's done, I'll show it to you."
m_ex_quency_escapequeen_03_37,"All right, good luck!"
m_ex_rumani_01_1,"Hello, Gym Rat!"
m_ex_rumani_01_2,"In case you don't recognize this number,"
m_ex_rumani_01_3,"it's Rumani, from Body X Body Gym."
m_ex_rumani_01_4,"Hey, Rumani. Nice to talk to you."
m_ex_rumani_01_5,Likewise!
m_ex_rumani_01_6,I'm really excited at the thought of
m_ex_rumani_01_7,being able to manage your progress
m_ex_rumani_01_8,more closely and frequently.
m_ex_rumani_01_9,Just thinking about it is making my muscles tingle! ^.^
m_ex_rumani_01_10,I think what you've done is enough for now...
m_ex_rumani_01_11,Oh no!
m_ex_rumani_01_12,"We were only in a trainer-member relationship before,"
m_ex_rumani_01_13,so all I could give were a few simple tips.
m_ex_rumani_01_14,"But now that we're officially a team,"
m_ex_rumani_01_15,I'll be able to give you proper personal training sessions.
m_ex_rumani_01_16,Is that really necessary?
m_ex_rumani_01_17,100%! It's my job to keep everyone in top shape!
m_ex_rumani_01_18,"Tell me,"
m_ex_rumani_01_19,have you been sitting a lot for work lately?
m_ex_rumani_01_20,"Yeah, a bit."
m_ex_rumani_01_21,"I couldn't help but notice your posture has worsened somewhat,"
m_ex_rumani_01_22,and your shoulders seem a bit rounded as well.
m_ex_rumani_01_23,I think starting with posture correction would be a good idea.
m_ex_rumani_01_24,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_rumani_01_25,I've also noticed that you don't stretch before your workouts.
m_ex_rumani_01_26,"Lifting weights and working up a sweat is all well and good, but"
m_ex_rumani_01_27,stretching before your workout is absolutely essential.
m_ex_rumani_01_28,Skipping this step could lead to muscle injuries
m_ex_rumani_01_29,or even posture issues.
m_ex_rumani_01_30,I'll show you a 20-minute stretching routine you can do before and after your workouts.
m_ex_rumani_01_31,"No, wait."
m_ex_rumani_01_32,"It seems like when you work out, you don't really have a set plan"
m_ex_rumani_01_33,and just go with what you feel like at the time.
m_ex_rumani_01_34,"From now on, I'll create a detailed plan for you."
m_ex_rumani_01_35,I'll analyze which of your muscle groups are weaker
m_ex_rumani_01_36,and where you have the most excess fat.
m_ex_rumani_01_37,"You'll love it,"
m_ex_rumani_01_38,I'm sure of it!
m_ex_rumani_01_39,The only thing is that I'll be pretty busy for a while...
m_ex_rumani_01_40,That's why I'll also be preparing a home workout routine for you.
m_ex_rumani_01_41,I'll even come over and help you with your training.
m_ex_rumani_01_42,Er... Don't you think we're going a bit overboard with all this?
m_ex_rumani_01_43,"It's important to establish these habits early on, so things will get easier later."
m_ex_rumani_01_44,"Don't worry,"
m_ex_rumani_01_45,I'll be there to help you along the way.
m_ex_rumani_01_46,"You don't have any plans for today, right?"
m_ex_rumani_01_47,I'll see you at the gym later.
m_ex_rumani_01_48,Hold on...
m_ex_rumani_01_49,Rumani doesn't respond.
m_ex_rumani_01_50,I can feel it in my bones that a hellish training regime is about to begin.
m_ex_rumani_02_1,Gym Rat.
m_ex_rumani_02_2,Gym Rat?
m_ex_rumani_02_3,Yes?
m_ex_rumani_02_4,Why didn't you come to the gym today?
m_ex_rumani_02_5,I was going to show you
m_ex_rumani_02_6,the new equipment that arrived today.
m_ex_rumani_02_7,Hello?
m_ex_rumani_02_8,Gym Rat?
m_ex_rumani_02_9,"Sorry, I don't feel too good today."
m_ex_rumani_02_10,"Oh,"
m_ex_rumani_02_11,I see.
m_ex_rumani_02_12,"If you're not feeling well, it's better to rest."
m_ex_rumani_02_13,"If you push yourself too hard,"
m_ex_rumani_02_14,you're liable to get injured.
m_ex_rumani_02_15,Did you see the doctor?
m_ex_rumani_02_16,"No, it's not that bad."
m_ex_rumani_02_17,Hmm...
m_ex_rumani_02_18,"I know you're the best judge of your own body,"
m_ex_rumani_02_19,"but still, I'm a little concerned."
m_ex_rumani_02_20,Can you tell me exactly what's wrong?
m_ex_rumani_02_21,My whole body has been aching for the past few days.
m_ex_rumani_02_22,Hm.
m_ex_rumani_02_23,"So, you've been feeling unwell for a few days now?"
m_ex_rumani_02_24,"Sounds like you've overexerted yourself with your recent workouts,"
m_ex_rumani_02_25,and you finally reached your limit.
m_ex_rumani_02_26,Sigh...
m_ex_rumani_02_27,It's my fault.
m_ex_rumani_02_28,I should have paid more attention to your condition.
m_ex_rumani_02_29,"No, it's my fault for hiding it."
m_ex_rumani_02_30,That's no excuse.
m_ex_rumani_02_31,"Even if you were trying to keep it hidden from me,"
m_ex_rumani_02_32,"as your trainer,"
m_ex_rumani_02_33,I should have known.
m_ex_rumani_02_34,I'm really sorry.
m_ex_rumani_02_35,"No, seriously, it's fine."
m_ex_rumani_02_36,How about I make it up to you?
m_ex_rumani_02_37,I can come over and give you a massage.
m_ex_rumani_02_38,Your muscles must be terribly sore.
m_ex_rumani_02_39,I know a technique that can alleviate that pain.
m_ex_rumani_02_40,"Well, if it's not too much trouble..."
m_ex_rumani_02_41,It's no trouble at all.
m_ex_rumani_02_42,I'll finish up this last set and come right over.
m_ex_rumani_02_43,Just wait a little bit.
m_ex_rumani_03_1,"Gym Rat,"
m_ex_rumani_03_2,are you busy?
m_ex_rumani_03_3,"No, what's up?"
m_ex_rumani_03_4,"I've been running this gym for a while now,"
m_ex_rumani_03_5,and I've noticed that most of our members are adults.
m_ex_rumani_03_6,The reasons for coming to the gym differ significantly across age groups.
m_ex_rumani_03_7,Young adults in their 20s are focused more on their physical appearance.
m_ex_rumani_03_8,"People in their 30s and 40s realize they're not as young anymore, so they focus on building their stamina."
m_ex_rumani_03_9,"Meanwhile, those in their 50s and 60s come to do light exercises to maintain their health."
m_ex_rumani_03_10,"Of course, there are other reasons, such as weight loss or rehabilitation."
m_ex_rumani_03_11,Makes sense.
m_ex_rumani_03_12,"However,"
m_ex_rumani_03_13,we have very few teenage members!
m_ex_rumani_03_14,Teenagers are probably too busy having fun to exercise.
m_ex_rumani_03_15,"Still, the earlier you start exercising, the better."
m_ex_rumani_03_16,"If they develop the habit early on, they'll naturally continue to exercise as they grow older."
m_ex_rumani_03_17,What do you think we can do to attract more teenage members?
m_ex_rumani_03_18,Let's create an Body X Body mascot and use it for marketing.
m_ex_rumani_03_19,Make exercising feel more like a video game.
m_ex_rumani_03_20,Oh!
m_ex_rumani_03_21,That's a great idea!
m_ex_rumani_03_22,We can create a muscular character
m_ex_rumani_03_23,to show kids the allure of physical fitness and make exercise feel more approachable.
m_ex_rumani_03_24,"Oh,"
m_ex_rumani_03_25,that's a great idea!
m_ex_rumani_03_26,"I could even take on the role of the villain,"
m_ex_rumani_03_27,"and every time they finish a set, they would deal significant damage to me."
m_ex_rumani_03_28,They'll only be able to defeat me by completing their full workout.
m_ex_rumani_03_29,"That way, it'll feel like a game and make exercising more fun for them!"
m_ex_rumani_03_30,Do you think that would get their attention?
m_ex_rumani_03_31,"Hmm, it could be tricky to pull off."
m_ex_rumani_03_32,You think so?
m_ex_rumani_03_33,This may be harder than I thought...
m_ex_rumani_03_34,I need to look into what teenagers are into nowadays
m_ex_rumani_03_35,and find a way to tie it into exercise somehow.
m_ex_rumani_03_36,"Anyway, thank you for the suggestion, Gym Rat."
m_ex_rumani_03_37,"Next time you visit, you'll get an extra hour of personal training on the house!"
m_ex_rumani_03_38,"Haha, thanks."
m_ex_rumani_03_39,Make sure to pump it up today!
m_ex_cinderella_01_1,Prince.
m_ex_cinderella_01_2,We can finally be together.
m_ex_cinderella_01_3,Cinderella?
m_ex_cinderella_01_4,"Yes, it's me."
m_ex_cinderella_01_5,"With you by my side, I shall fight for humanity"
m_ex_cinderella_01_6,and be the one to bring forth our beautiful victory.
m_ex_cinderella_01_7,I know that I can rely on you.
m_ex_cinderella_01_8,Beautiful as always.
m_ex_cinderella_01_9,"Reliable is a fine thing,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_10,"but I would prefer you use the word ""beautiful"" instead."
m_ex_cinderella_01_11,A lovely choice of words.
m_ex_cinderella_01_12,Everyone shines the brightest when their beauty is at its peak.
m_ex_cinderella_01_13,"Tell me, Prince,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_14,what are you fighting for?
m_ex_cinderella_01_15,I fight for everyone who's fighting to reclaim the surface.
m_ex_cinderella_01_16,"A beautiful cause, just like you, Prince."
m_ex_cinderella_01_17,A beautiful story will be written from it.
m_ex_cinderella_01_18,There was a time when I miswrote my own story.
m_ex_cinderella_01_19,"As a result, I must rewrite it,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_20,so that it is respectable and beautiful.
m_ex_cinderella_01_21,"As long as I am by Prince and Grave's side,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_22,"I am certain that I will be able to write a new ending, the right ending."
m_ex_cinderella_01_23,"I will do my best to help you,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_24,so I ask you to help me as well.
m_ex_cinderella_01_25,So that my story won't falter.
m_ex_cinderella_01_26,You can trust me.
m_ex_cinderella_01_27,Are you sure I can do it?
m_ex_cinderella_01_28,Wonderful.
m_ex_cinderella_01_29,That's the most beautiful answer.
m_ex_cinderella_01_30,Of course!
m_ex_cinderella_01_31,"I must say, such a lack of confidence is truly unappealing."
m_ex_cinderella_01_32,"When beautiful things come together, your story will never falter."
m_ex_cinderella_01_33,Believe in yourself.
m_ex_cinderella_01_34,Will do.
m_ex_cinderella_01_35,"I shall keep in touch,"
m_ex_cinderella_01_36,my beautiful Prince.
m_ex_cinderella_02_1,Prince.
m_ex_cinderella_02_2,I have a question.
m_ex_cinderella_02_3,"For a few days now, I've been receiving notifications on my phone which are decidedly not beautiful."
m_ex_cinderella_02_4,Do you know how I can fix this?
m_ex_cinderella_02_5,What kind of notifications?
m_ex_cinderella_02_6,Hold on.
m_ex_cinderella_02_7,I'll copy and paste the message for you:
m_ex_cinderella_02_8,Your storage space is running out. Please free up some space to avoid potential issues with saving data and files.
m_ex_cinderella_02_9,That's what it says.
m_ex_cinderella_02_10,What have you been doing to use up so much storage?
m_ex_cinderella_02_11,What do you mean?
m_ex_cinderella_02_12,What could I possibly do to have done that?
m_ex_cinderella_02_13,That's true. I don't see you as the type to play mobile games.
m_ex_cinderella_02_14,That's correct.
m_ex_cinderella_02_15,The most I've done is take a few pictures of myself.
m_ex_cinderella_02_16,Pictures?
m_ex_cinderella_02_17,I asked Grave to take them for me.
m_ex_cinderella_02_18,"Of course,"
m_ex_cinderella_02_19,"I look wonderful no matter how the photo is taken,"
m_ex_cinderella_02_20,but there are some angles that are more flattering.
m_ex_cinderella_02_21,So we've been practicing how to take beautiful pictures together.
m_ex_cinderella_02_22,Exactly how many photos have you taken?
m_ex_cinderella_02_23,I'm not sure.
m_ex_cinderella_02_24,Maybe about 500 photos a day?
m_ex_cinderella_02_25,500?!
m_ex_cinderella_02_26,Yes.
m_ex_cinderella_02_27,"The ones that Grave took, at least."
m_ex_cinderella_02_28,You mean there are others?
m_ex_cinderella_02_29,"Whenever I take a selfie, they capture my beauty exceptionally well."
m_ex_cinderella_02_30,"If I add those, I'd say I have about 1,000 photos in total?"
m_ex_cinderella_02_31,"Being able to capture beautiful moments in beautiful ways is a beautiful thing,"
m_ex_cinderella_02_32,so I've been working hard on capturing those moments.
m_ex_cinderella_02_33,"However, static pictures weren't enough,"
m_ex_cinderella_02_34,so I started recording videos as well.
m_ex_cinderella_02_35,Why are you recording videos?
m_ex_cinderella_02_36,To leave behind beautiful moments.
m_ex_cinderella_02_37,Grave also likes it when I send them to her.
m_ex_cinderella_02_38,I'd suggest erasing some of those photos and videos.
m_ex_cinderella_02_39,Why?
m_ex_cinderella_02_40,"They are filled with my beauty, so shouldn't I treasure them forever?"
m_ex_cinderella_02_41,I think they're the reason why your phone is out of space.
m_ex_cinderella_02_42,Oh.
m_ex_cinderella_02_43,Do you think so?
m_ex_cinderella_02_44,Hmm...
m_ex_cinderella_02_45,Is there any way to increase the storage?
m_ex_cinderella_02_46,"There is, but it would take some time."
m_ex_cinderella_02_47,I see.
m_ex_cinderella_02_48,Then I guess there's nothing I can do.
m_ex_cinderella_02_49,Grave will be devastated if I delete my beautiful photos and videos.
m_ex_cinderella_02_50,I suppose I'll just have to tell her to see me more often in person.
m_ex_cinderella_02_51,"Thanks, Prince."
m_ex_cinderella_02_52,Right...
m_ex_cinderella_03_1,Today is a beautiful day.
m_ex_cinderella_03_2,I had a dream of a time when humanity reclaimed the surface.
m_ex_cinderella_03_3,Grave woke me with a voice as sweet as honey.
m_ex_cinderella_03_4,"When I opened my eyes, the sky was clear,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_5,and all I could hear was the gentle whispers of the wind.
m_ex_cinderella_03_6,Sounds like a fairy tale.
m_ex_cinderella_03_7,"Yes, that's right."
m_ex_cinderella_03_8,"And now that I'm speaking with you, Prince,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_9,it has truly become a perfectly beautiful day.
m_ex_cinderella_03_10,"Stop, you're making me blush."
m_ex_cinderella_03_11,Ever since I decided to
m_ex_cinderella_03_12,"regain control of my story,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_13,you are an irreplaceable character in it.
m_ex_cinderella_03_14,"In these beautiful, fairytale moments,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_15,you must always be by my side.
m_ex_cinderella_03_16,"So,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_17,how has your day been so far?
m_ex_cinderella_03_18,Have I helped it become more beautiful?
m_ex_cinderella_03_19,Of course.
m_ex_cinderella_03_20,Just as I thought.
m_ex_cinderella_03_21,I'm a vital character in your story as well.
m_ex_cinderella_03_22,"Of course, I have always heard how there are"
m_ex_cinderella_03_23,many characters in your story.
m_ex_cinderella_03_24,I simply must ask:
m_ex_cinderella_03_25,Where do I stand among them?
m_ex_cinderella_03_26,"Hmm, that's a tough one..."
m_ex_cinderella_03_27,Hm.
m_ex_cinderella_03_28,"I'm not sure if you're avoiding the question,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_29,or if you truly believe that rankings don't matter because I'm number one.
m_ex_cinderella_03_30,"At any rate, today is a beautiful day,"
m_ex_cinderella_03_31,so I won't press the matter.
m_ex_cinderella_03_32,The most important thing is how our story ends.
m_ex_cinderella_03_33,Thank you...
m_ex_cinderella_03_34,Let's make sure our stories have a happy ending.
m_ex_cinderella_03_35,"Yes, let's."
m_ex_grave_01_1,Can you see this message?
m_ex_grave_01_2,"Yes, I see it."
m_ex_grave_01_3,Thank goodness.
m_ex_grave_01_4,Have you heard the news?
m_ex_grave_01_5,"From now on,"
m_ex_grave_01_6,I'll be here to assist you.
m_ex_grave_01_7,I'll be fighting alongside you.
m_ex_grave_01_8,Won't it be too exhausting for you?
m_ex_grave_01_9,It would be an honor to be able to fight
m_ex_grave_01_10,"alongside you, Superhuman."
m_ex_grave_01_11,"Besides,"
m_ex_grave_01_12,I have gone through much more trying tribulations on my own.
m_ex_grave_01_13,"But it's okay now, because I'm no longer alone."
m_ex_grave_01_14,"You're here, and so is Cinderella."
m_ex_grave_01_15,You're putting your trust in me?
m_ex_grave_01_16,Of course.
m_ex_grave_01_17,And you should put your trust in me as well.
m_ex_grave_01_18,"Once I decide to protect something,"
m_ex_grave_01_19,I stick through it until the very end.
m_ex_grave_01_20,Just like how you protected Cinderella.
m_ex_grave_01_21,That's right.
m_ex_grave_01_22,Cinderella also said that
m_ex_grave_01_23,"in this new rewritten story of ours,"
m_ex_grave_01_24,it would only be beautiful if all of us are there.
m_ex_grave_01_25,So I'll have to protect both of you.
m_ex_grave_01_26,"Of course, I understand if you don't have full faith in me."
m_ex_grave_01_27,Not at all. I feel quite safe around you.
m_ex_grave_01_28,You do?
m_ex_grave_01_29,Thanks for saying that.
m_ex_grave_01_30,You flatter me.
m_ex_grave_01_31,"What can I say? You deserve every compliment that comes your way, Grave."
m_ex_grave_01_32,You see?
m_ex_grave_01_33,You just complimented me again.
m_ex_grave_01_34,I... I'm not entirely sure how to respond in a situation like this.
m_ex_grave_01_35,I've gotta get going.
m_ex_grave_01_36,Take care.
m_ex_grave_01_37,"Haha, okay."
m_ex_grave_02_1,Hand mirror.
m_ex_grave_02_2,Comb.
m_ex_grave_02_3,?
m_ex_grave_02_4,Battery.
m_ex_grave_02_5,Oil.
m_ex_grave_02_6,"What are you doing, Grave?"
m_ex_grave_02_7,Huh?
m_ex_grave_02_8,?
m_ex_grave_02_9,What's going on?
m_ex_grave_02_10,This is clearly for taking notes.
m_ex_grave_02_11,I was told I could write down whatever I wanted to memorize in here.
m_ex_grave_02_12,"The name of the chat room is even called ""Notepad""."
m_ex_grave_02_13,I didn't even know you could talk to a notepad...
m_ex_grave_02_14,This is {AccountData.NickName}.
m_ex_grave_02_15,!
m_ex_grave_02_16,Superhuman?
m_ex_grave_02_17,I thought this was my notes section. How am I talking to you?
m_ex_grave_02_18,What in the world is going on?
m_ex_grave_02_19,Anis and
m_ex_grave_02_20,Neon said
m_ex_grave_02_21,I should write notes down here.
m_ex_grave_02_22,"The room is even called ""Notepad""."
m_ex_grave_02_23,I'm not entirely sure what's going on myself.
m_ex_grave_02_24,It seems they changed the name of the chat room at some point.
m_ex_grave_02_25,"So this isn't the notes section,"
m_ex_grave_02_26,but a chat room? With you in it?
m_ex_grave_02_27,It appears so.
m_ex_grave_02_28,"I'm sorry, Superhuman."
m_ex_grave_02_29,I should have double-checked before writing things down here.
m_ex_grave_02_30,"No, Anis and Neon are the ones to blame here."
m_ex_grave_02_31,Well...
m_ex_grave_02_32,Is it okay if I keep writing down memos here?
m_ex_grave_02_33,?
m_ex_grave_02_34,I'm often forgetting all sorts of little things.
m_ex_grave_02_35,That's why I need to take notes in the first place.
m_ex_grave_02_36,The only thing is there's never a proper place for me to take them.
m_ex_grave_02_37,Do you not have a note app on your phone? Or a paper notebook?
m_ex_grave_02_38,I'm more comfortable writing things here.
m_ex_grave_02_39,"It gives me a sense of stability,"
m_ex_grave_02_40,and I seem to remember things better.
m_ex_grave_02_41,Does it bother you?
m_ex_grave_02_42,"If it does, I'll stop."
m_ex_grave_02_43,"No, no, it's fine."
m_ex_grave_02_44,Is it?
m_ex_grave_02_45,Thanks.
m_ex_grave_02_46,Hand mirror.
m_ex_grave_02_47,Comb.
m_ex_grave_02_48,Battery.
m_ex_grave_02_49,"For the sake of convenience, I'll let Grave keep using this for her notes."
m_ex_grave_03_1,I have a question.
m_ex_grave_03_2,How do you define beauty?
m_ex_grave_03_3,What makes you ask?
m_ex_grave_03_4,"Cinderella is beautiful,"
m_ex_grave_03_5,as are you.
m_ex_grave_03_6,I think
m_ex_grave_03_7,anyone who shines bright is beautiful.
m_ex_grave_03_8,"Cinderella's opinion differs from mine, though."
m_ex_grave_03_9,What she considers beautiful are people who are close to her.
m_ex_grave_03_10,Anyone who refuses to give up and fights for their right to live.
m_ex_grave_03_11,She even considers me beautiful.
m_ex_grave_03_12,I feel like there's a kind of beauty out there which I don't fully understand.
m_ex_grave_03_13,That's why I asked you that question.
m_ex_grave_03_14,I think everyone defines beauty differently.
m_ex_grave_03_15,You're right.
m_ex_grave_03_16,I knew that.
m_ex_grave_03_17,"That doesn't satisfy my curiosity, however."
m_ex_grave_03_18,I want to understand beauty as Cinderella sees it.
m_ex_grave_03_19,Wouldn't asking Cinderella solve this quickly?
m_ex_grave_03_20,I did ask her.
m_ex_grave_03_21,She said her appreciation of beauty is the same as I see it.
m_ex_grave_03_22,I don't follow.
m_ex_grave_03_23,You're overthinking this. Keep it simple.
m_ex_grave_03_24,What do you mean?
m_ex_grave_03_25,She's talking about how wonderful a friendship between two people who trust and respect one another is.
m_ex_grave_03_26,"Trust, respect..."
m_ex_grave_03_27,A wonderful friendship...
m_ex_grave_03_28,"When you say it out loud like that, I think I get it."
m_ex_grave_03_29,Isn't that like the relationship you and I have?
m_ex_grave_03_30,Exactly.
m_ex_grave_03_31,I see!
m_ex_grave_03_32,It is a beautiful relationship indeed.
m_ex_grave_03_33,I think anything that is able to survive and thrive in such an inhospitable environment like the surface is a beautiful thing.
m_ex_grave_03_34,Thriving?
m_ex_grave_03_35,On the surface?
m_ex_grave_03_36,It's a hard concept to grasp.
m_ex_grave_03_37,But that's precisely what you and Cinderella have done.
m_ex_grave_03_38,!
m_ex_grave_03_39,That's right.
m_ex_grave_03_40,"We spent all those long years up on the surface,"
m_ex_grave_03_41,and survived.
m_ex_grave_03_42,We have an inexhaustible strength.
m_ex_grave_03_43,"Even in the times where we felt desperate and miserable,"
m_ex_grave_03_44,Cinderella remained as beautiful as ever.
m_ex_grave_03_45,Perhaps that's why she feels you're so beautiful as well.
m_ex_grave_03_46,But I'm broken.
m_ex_grave_03_47,"I've fixed myself up quite a bit,"
m_ex_grave_03_48,but I'm still far from beautiful.
m_ex_grave_03_49,Would you stop thinking Cinderella was beautiful if she changed physically?
m_ex_grave_03_50,What are you talking about?
m_ex_grave_03_51,Appearance doesn't matter.
m_ex_grave_03_52,"Cinderella will always be beautiful, no matter what."
m_ex_grave_03_53,"Precisely, and the same applies to you."
m_ex_grave_03_54,!
m_ex_grave_03_55,I see!
m_ex_grave_03_56,I think I understand now.
m_ex_grave_03_57,"I understand what it was about me that Cinderella found beautiful,"
m_ex_grave_03_58,and why she always calls me beautiful when she's looking at me.
m_ex_grave_03_59,Hmm.
m_ex_grave_03_60,"Thank you, Superhuman."
m_ex_grave_03_61,I think I've found the answer to my question.
m_ex_grave_03_62,"Thank you,"
m_ex_grave_03_63,truly.
m_ex_grave_03_64,I ought to be the one thanking you for calling me beautiful.
m_ex_grave_03_65,You are beautiful.
m_ex_grave_03_66,Don't ever lose that light which burns inside you.
m_ex_grave_03_67,I won't. I'll never lose it.
m_ex_grave_03_68,I believe you.
m_ex_oldtales_01_1,Prince! Grave!
m_ex_oldtales_01_2,We've got a big problem.
m_ex_oldtales_01_3,Cinderella.
m_ex_oldtales_01_4,What's wrong?
m_ex_oldtales_01_5,The ends of my hair got tangled.
m_ex_oldtales_01_6,What?
m_ex_oldtales_01_7,Was it something I did?
m_ex_oldtales_01_8,Did I get them tangled up somehow?
m_ex_oldtales_01_9,No.
m_ex_oldtales_01_10,"Prince was very thorough in his brushing yesterday,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_11,but perhaps he could have been more beautiful in applying the finishing touches.
m_ex_oldtales_01_12,"Superhuman,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_13,Cinderella's hair is very delicate.
m_ex_oldtales_01_14,You can't simply brush it with the bare minimum amount of care necessary.
m_ex_oldtales_01_15,"Because it's so long and silky,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_16,"you have to brush it attentively the entire time,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_17,from the very beginning to the very end.
m_ex_oldtales_01_18,I'm sorry...
m_ex_oldtales_01_19,Sorry won't cut it.
m_ex_oldtales_01_20,"Once Cinderella's hair gets tangled,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_21,do you realize what an ordeal it is to untangle it?
m_ex_oldtales_01_22,Sorting out all the twisted bits without damaging her hair
m_ex_oldtales_01_23,takes far more time and effort than brushing it.
m_ex_oldtales_01_24,I said I was sorry...
m_ex_oldtales_01_25,"Grave, that's enough."
m_ex_oldtales_01_26,It's far from beautiful to become as incensed as you are.
m_ex_oldtales_01_27,I'm perfectly fine.
m_ex_oldtales_01_28,All right.
m_ex_oldtales_01_29,"Sorry, I got a little worked up."
m_ex_oldtales_01_30,"That's very kind of you, Cinderella."
m_ex_oldtales_01_31,Now then.
m_ex_oldtales_01_32,"Since we all would like to avoid this in the future,"
m_ex_oldtales_01_33,"Grave, why don't you teach Prince how to brush my hair?"
m_ex_oldtales_01_34,What?
m_ex_oldtales_01_35,Grave brushes my hair perfectly.
m_ex_oldtales_01_36,"The speed, pressure, the general feel. Everything."
m_ex_oldtales_01_37,All right.
m_ex_oldtales_01_38,"Where are you, Superhuman?"
m_ex_oldtales_01_39,I'll go over the finer points of hair brushing with you.
m_ex_oldtales_01_40,The finer points? Is it really that complicated?
m_ex_oldtales_01_41,Hey!
m_ex_oldtales_01_42,I don't like your attitude.
m_ex_oldtales_01_43,This is an important matter. One worthy of dedicating an entire class to.
m_ex_oldtales_01_44,Sorry...
m_ex_oldtales_01_45,I'll prepare some different combs.
m_ex_oldtales_01_46,Come by whenever you have time.
m_ex_oldtales_01_47,All right.
m_ex_oldtales_02_1,I can't believe it!
m_ex_oldtales_02_2,I just received the most amazing gift.
m_ex_oldtales_02_3,Cinderella's hair.
m_ex_oldtales_02_4,"It's always been silky smooth,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_5,but now it flows even more than before.
m_ex_oldtales_02_6,It has a breathtaking fragrance to it as well.
m_ex_oldtales_02_7,I feel as if its beauty has deepened even further.
m_ex_oldtales_02_8,"I'm glad you approve, hehe. I borrowed some essential oils from Anis."
m_ex_oldtales_02_9,Oh.
m_ex_oldtales_02_10,That was a lovely gesture.
m_ex_oldtales_02_11,Your hair-brushing skills have also improved.
m_ex_oldtales_02_12,I'm sure we have Grave's impeccable instruction to thank for that.
m_ex_oldtales_02_13,"Oh no, it wasn't just me."
m_ex_oldtales_02_14,Superhuman is incredibly intelligent.
m_ex_oldtales_02_15,"If you teach him one thing, he learns ten."
m_ex_oldtales_02_16,He picks things up quickly.
m_ex_oldtales_02_17,Only because you explained things so well.
m_ex_oldtales_02_18,Seeing you two compliment each other like this...
m_ex_oldtales_02_19,It's so beautiful.
m_ex_oldtales_02_20,"Erm... you're making me feel embarrassed, talking like that."
m_ex_oldtales_02_21,"There's still plenty of essential oil left, so why don't you try some, Grave?"
m_ex_oldtales_02_22,Oh my.
m_ex_oldtales_02_23,What an absolutely wonderful idea!
m_ex_oldtales_02_24,"You've always been the one brushing my hair,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_25,"Grave,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_26,so today I'll brush yours.
m_ex_oldtales_02_27,"While I'm at it,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_28,how would you like me to tie up your hair into twintails like mine? I think it would look lovely on you.
m_ex_oldtales_02_29,"Thank you, but that's all right."
m_ex_oldtales_02_30,"It doesn't matter how much of the essential oil is left, it should be left for Cinderella."
m_ex_oldtales_02_31,I don't need it.
m_ex_oldtales_02_32,"No, I want to brush your hair myself,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_33,and apply some of this essential oil.
m_ex_oldtales_02_34,"Honestly, I'm okay."
m_ex_oldtales_02_35,"If you're going to insist on turning me down,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_36,you ought to give me a good reason.
m_ex_oldtales_02_37,"Otherwise, that's the most un-beautiful behavior."
m_ex_oldtales_02_38,Hmm...
m_ex_oldtales_02_39,Uh...
m_ex_oldtales_02_40,I'm embarrassed.
m_ex_oldtales_02_41,It's awkward.
m_ex_oldtales_02_42,"You two keep complimenting me,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_43,and Cinderella is offering to style my hair herself.
m_ex_oldtales_02_44,It just feels awkward.
m_ex_oldtales_02_45,Really?
m_ex_oldtales_02_46,Yes.
m_ex_oldtales_02_47,Then we'll have to do it until you get used to it.
m_ex_oldtales_02_48,"An excellent suggestion, Prince."
m_ex_oldtales_02_49,You and I are on the same page.
m_ex_oldtales_02_50,Are you free right now?
m_ex_oldtales_02_51,I sure am.
m_ex_oldtales_02_52,"In that case, come over straight away."
m_ex_oldtales_02_53,Will do.
m_ex_oldtales_02_54,Wait a second.
m_ex_oldtales_02_55,This is going to be a wonderful time.
m_ex_oldtales_02_56,I'm so excited!
m_ex_oldtales_02_57,"As long as you're happy,"
m_ex_oldtales_02_58,I'm happy.
m_ex_oldtales_02_59,"I'll wait for you, Superhuman."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_1,Leona has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_2,Leona has invited Flora to join the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_3,Leona has invited Biscuit to join the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_4,Leona has invited Nero to join the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_5,Is that everyone?
m_ex_secretgarden_01_6,Meow.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_7,Leona.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_8,Why did you invite me?
m_ex_secretgarden_01_9,I'm sitting right next to you.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_10,"Haha, I guess I invited everyone out of habit."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_11,"You can leave if you want, Nero."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_12,"Ugh, so irritating."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_13,I'll go play with Timi then.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_14,What's this group chat for?
m_ex_secretgarden_01_15,"I wanted to make sure that you all made it safe and sound,"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_16,so I figured I'd make a group chat.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_17,"I asked Biscuit if she had arrived safely,"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_18,but she hasn't replied.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_19,So I was getting worried!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_20,It's nice to see
m_ex_secretgarden_01_21,everyone looking out for each other ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_01_22,Of course!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_23,"If anything were to happen, we'd have to head up there straight away."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_24,We all made it safe.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_25,"Biscuit is beside me,"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_26,eating berries as we speak ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_01_27,"Oh, nice!"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_28,We'll be heading back to the garden soon ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_01_29,Take care of yourselves.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_30,"If anything comes up, just send a message in this group chat anytime."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_31,Whoops!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_32,I'm so sorry I didn't get back to you sooner! T_T
m_ex_secretgarden_01_33,No worries!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_34,Max seems to miss you a lot.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_35,"He's sitting beside me and keeps stealing glances at me, haha."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_36,Really?
m_ex_secretgarden_01_37,Tell him that I miss him too!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_38,"Haha, I relayed the message."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_39,"His tail is wagging so fast that I can't even see it, haha."
m_ex_secretgarden_01_40,"Oh, by the way!"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_41,"I'm eating these berries called Peachberries right now,"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_42,and I really want to share them with you two!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_43,They're super delicious!
m_ex_secretgarden_01_44,"If we have a chance to go up to the surface together next time, we definitely have to have some!"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_45,"I can't bring any to the Ark, unfortunately. T_T"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_46,Leona doesn't reply.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_47,"Are you there, Leona?"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_48,There's still no reply.
m_ex_secretgarden_01_49,Seems like she's busy tending to the garden ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_01_50,"Once Sunflower finishes with her berries,"
m_ex_secretgarden_01_51,we'll start heading back ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_02_1,Leona!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_2,Leona!!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_3,Leonaaa!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_4,Leonnnaaa!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_5,LEONA!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_6,LEONNNAAA!
m_ex_secretgarden_02_7,??
m_ex_secretgarden_02_8,What is it?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_9,Is something wrong?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_10,Could you come to the garden?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_11,Why?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_12,Did something happen?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_13,Meow.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_14,Something is definitely the matter.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_15,Well? Is anyone going to tell me?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_16,"Apparently, Rian is planning on visiting the garden tomorrow."
m_ex_secretgarden_02_17,She is?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_18,How come?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_19,She wants to see
m_ex_secretgarden_02_20,"whether the garden is contributing anything of value,"
m_ex_secretgarden_02_21,but the Aurora Bloom
m_ex_secretgarden_02_22,hasn't fully blossomed yet.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_23,We need a little more time for it to bloom.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_24,"That's why we need your help, Peach Blossom ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_02_25,We're opening up the garden.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_26,"To the public, you mean?"
m_ex_secretgarden_02_27,Yes ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_02_28,Can you help us?
m_ex_secretgarden_02_29,"You've gotta help us, Leona! T_T"
m_ex_secretgarden_02_30,"If we work together, we can do this!"
m_ex_secretgarden_02_31,Hmm...
m_ex_secretgarden_02_32,I think I understand what's going on.
m_ex_secretgarden_02_33,I'll head over straight away.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_1,Flora!
m_ex_secretgarden_03_2,Did a reporter visit the garden?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_3,Yes.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_4,He took photos of the garden and left ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_03_5,Looks like you're doing a great job with the publicity.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_6,"Wow,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_7,that's amazing!
m_ex_secretgarden_03_8,Um...
m_ex_secretgarden_03_9,??
m_ex_secretgarden_03_10,I have something I'd like to apologize to Flora about.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_11,To me?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_12,What for? ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_03_13,"We were handing out promo posters,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_14,and someone who said he was a reporter
m_ex_secretgarden_03_15,showed a lot of interest.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_16,"Anyway, he started taking photos and asking all sorts of questions,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_17,kinda like an interview!
m_ex_secretgarden_03_18,"I totally blanked out,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_19,"and before I knew it, I ended up saying the things you were supposed to say..."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_20,"I told him about how Syuen is fully behind the garden being unveiled to the public,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_21,"and how she hopes that seeing the flowers, and how full of life they are,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_22,will inspire people.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_23,I'm sorry!
m_ex_secretgarden_03_24,I didn't even realize what I was saying.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_25,It was my first time being interviewed like that.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_26,No wonder you've been such a nervous wreck lately.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_27,I was worried I might have made a mistake.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_28,"Don't worry, you did nothing of the sort."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_29,"I must say that I didn't expect the reporter to head straight for the garden, though."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_30,You did well ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_03_31,I would've said the same thing myself.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_32,Don't worry too much.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_33,"In fact, your doing that may have helped us avoid a crisis."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_34,What?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_35,Did something happen?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_36,Rian paid us a visit.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_37,?!
m_ex_secretgarden_03_38,Why did she come today?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_39,Wasn't she supposed to come tomorrow?
m_ex_secretgarden_03_40,"Yes,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_41,but it seems she decided to stop by after seeing one of the promotional posters ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_03_42,"Rian already caught wind of the posters? Well, that was fast!"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_43,"Maybe we're better at publicity than we thought, meow."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_44,Even Lobelia saw one.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_45,"Initially,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_46,"she intended to shut down the garden and cancel the event,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_47,"but thanks to that reporter's visit,"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_48,Salvia ended up giving an interview where she wished everyone a joyful time in the garden ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_03_49,It turned out well.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_50,"Phew, what a relief!"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_51,"And we owe it all to you, Sunflower ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_03_52,Hehe :3
m_ex_secretgarden_03_53,"Nice timing, meow."
m_ex_secretgarden_03_54,Indeed.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_55,Things really seem to be working out in our favor.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_56,We should step up our publicity campaign even more.
m_ex_secretgarden_03_57,I can't wait to see what you all come up with!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_1,"Everyone, thank you so much for all your hard work over the past two weeks ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_2,"Without Blossom and the Happy Zoo,"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_3,we never would have been able to protect the garden ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_04_4,Hehe :3
m_ex_secretgarden_04_5,These past two weeks have meant the world to me.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_6,I wish the garden could stay open every day.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_7,Meow!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_8,"Whenever I'm lying down in the garden,"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_9,I fall asleep in no time.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_10,You all did a great job.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_11,I also enjoyed the food Trainer bought for us!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_12,"Yeah, thanks for the cat treats, meow."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_13,"Thanks, Zoo Keeper!"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_14,"That's so nice of you to bring Timi such tasty treats, hehe."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_15,"Thank you, Blossom ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_16,I enjoyed learning about all the flowers while working in the garden!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_17,"Oh, by the way, Flora."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_18,I noticed there are some delphiniums and freesias in the garden.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_19,Could you remind me again what those flowers stand for?
m_ex_secretgarden_04_20,"I memorized the meanings of dahlias and marigolds,"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_21,but I forgot about those two. T_T
m_ex_secretgarden_04_22,Of course ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_04_23,Delphiniums symbolize
m_ex_secretgarden_04_24,the desire
m_ex_secretgarden_04_25,to make another person happy.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_26,Whoa!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_27,??
m_ex_secretgarden_04_28,"That'd be the perfect flower for me to give you, Trainer!"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_29,"Hahaha, I'll just accept the thought."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_30,Delphinium looks like
m_ex_secretgarden_04_31,"it'd be perfect to use while out hunting, meow."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_32,"Steady now, Nero."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_33,"As for freesia,"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_34,it symbolizes the desire for someone
m_ex_secretgarden_04_35,to have a new beginning.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_36,These flowers have such beautiful meanings.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_37,"I know, right?"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_38,"Can we visit the garden again sometime,"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_39,Flora?
m_ex_secretgarden_04_40,"Of course, you're welcome to visit anytime ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_41,"Then, could you tell me more about the flowers in the garden next time?"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_42,"While I was walking around, there were a lot of flowers that I was curious about."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_43,Of course ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_04_44,I'll tell you everything you want to know.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_45,Thanks!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_46,"All right, we better leave for now."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_47,It does get confusing when there are too many group chats T_T
m_ex_secretgarden_04_48,This was fun!
m_ex_secretgarden_04_49,"See you next time, meow."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_50,I had a great time.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_51,Biscuit left the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_52,Nero left the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_53,Leona left the group.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_54,"Aren't you leaving, Blossom?"
m_ex_secretgarden_04_55,"I'm planning on staying, actually."
m_ex_secretgarden_04_56,Then I'll stay as well.
m_ex_secretgarden_04_57,This group chat holds plenty of memories worth keeping ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_05_1,Blossom ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_05_2,Did you get home safely?
m_ex_secretgarden_05_3,Whoops!
m_ex_secretgarden_05_4,"I'm sorry,"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_5,I meant to send that
m_ex_secretgarden_05_6,as a private message.
m_ex_secretgarden_05_7,That's all right. It happens.
m_ex_secretgarden_05_8,I enjoyed our walk in the garden today ✿
m_ex_secretgarden_05_9,As did I.
m_ex_secretgarden_05_10,Did you happen to look up
m_ex_secretgarden_05_11,the meaning of the lilac I gave you?
m_ex_secretgarden_05_12,"I did, and it seems to have multiple meanings."
m_ex_secretgarden_05_13,"Yes, there are flowers that have several meanings ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_14,"One of them is ""gratitude"". Is that what you wanted to convey?"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_15,"My message is shown as read, but Flora doesn't reply."
m_ex_secretgarden_05_16,"Or ""respect"", perhaps?"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_17,"Flora reads my message, but doesn't reply."
m_ex_secretgarden_05_18,"Or could it have something to do with love? But this isn't it, right?"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_19,What makes you so sure?
m_ex_secretgarden_05_20,Oh?
m_ex_secretgarden_05_21,The meaning I want to convey
m_ex_secretgarden_05_22,is that of first love.
m_ex_secretgarden_05_23,!!
m_ex_secretgarden_05_24,"Let's go for another walk in the garden sometime soon, Blossom ✿"
m_ex_secretgarden_05_25,@}>->----
m_ex_secretgarden_05_26,Flora.
m_ex_secretgarden_05_27,"Since then, Flora hasn't read any of my messages."
m_ex_flora_01_1,"Hello, Blossom.✿"
m_ex_flora_01_2,"I'm Flora,"
m_ex_flora_01_3,a member of the Botanic Garden Squad.✿
m_ex_flora_01_4,Nice to meet you.
m_ex_flora_01_5,Looking forward to working with you.✿
m_ex_flora_01_6,It's a joy to meet you.✿
m_ex_flora_01_7,"You have great sense, Blossom.✿"
m_ex_flora_01_8,It's a pleasure to meet you.✿
m_ex_flora_01_9,I collect flowers and seeds from up on the surface
m_ex_flora_01_10,and cultivate them in my garden.✿
m_ex_flora_01_11,If you need anything
m_ex_flora_01_12,"or are ever curious about flowers,"
m_ex_flora_01_13,feel free to stop by the garden anytime.✿
m_ex_flora_01_14,Got it.
m_ex_flora_01_15,"Is there a flower you particularly like,"
m_ex_flora_01_16,Blossom?
m_ex_flora_01_17,"I'm planning on introducing a new flower to my garden,"
m_ex_flora_01_18,"and would love to grow one that you are fond of, Blossom."
m_ex_flora_01_19,I don't know much about flowers.
m_ex_flora_01_20,"I like anemones, violas, and a few others."
m_ex_flora_01_21,I see.
m_ex_flora_01_22,"When you visit the garden,"
m_ex_flora_01_23,I'll tell you more about them.✿
m_ex_flora_01_24,There are so many kinds of flowers in the world.✿
m_ex_flora_01_25,I'm sure there will be at least one that you love.
m_ex_flora_01_26,I didn't expect you to be so interested in flowers.✿
m_ex_flora_01_27,I'll do my best
m_ex_flora_01_28,to cultivate the flowers you love most
m_ex_flora_01_29,before you come to visit.✿
m_ex_flora_01_30,I'll stop by for sure.
m_ex_flora_01_31,Chatting with you
m_ex_flora_01_32,really makes it feel like time has flown by.
m_ex_flora_01_33,It's already time to give the flowers their nutrients.✿
m_ex_flora_01_34,May I message you again in the future?
m_ex_flora_01_35,Of course.
m_ex_flora_01_36,Thank you.✿
m_ex_flora_01_37,I hope you have a wonderful day.✿
m_ex_flora_01_38,@}>->----
m_ex_flora_02_1,"Blossom,"
m_ex_flora_02_2,are you busy today?✿
m_ex_flora_02_3,"No, I'm free."
m_ex_flora_02_4,Would it be all right to visit you in the Commander's Room?
m_ex_flora_02_5,"I need something for the garden,"
m_ex_flora_02_6,"and since I haven't been out in a while,"
m_ex_flora_02_7,it feels a bit of a waste to go straight back to the garden.
m_ex_flora_02_8,"Of course, come by anytime."
m_ex_flora_02_9,Thank you!
m_ex_flora_02_10,"I saw many people who reminded me of flowers today, and it made me very happy.✿"
m_ex_flora_02_11,"I saw someone who looked like a daisy,"
m_ex_flora_02_12,"another who resembled a cosmos,"
m_ex_flora_02_13,and another who was the spitting image of a primrose.
m_ex_flora_02_14,Which flower do I resemble?
m_ex_flora_02_15,"You, Blossom?"
m_ex_flora_02_16,Hmm...
m_ex_flora_02_17,Flora doesn't respond for a while.
m_ex_flora_02_18,Do I not resemble any flower?
m_ex_flora_02_19,"Oh no,"
m_ex_flora_02_20,that's not it.
m_ex_flora_02_21,It's that there are too many flowers that you're reminiscent of.
m_ex_flora_02_22,It's quite difficult to choose just one.✿
m_ex_flora_02_23,"Still, I'd really like for you to choose one for me."
m_ex_flora_02_24,All right then.
m_ex_flora_02_25,"In that case, I would choose the buttercup."
m_ex_flora_02_26,Why that one?
m_ex_flora_02_27,"Buttercups have a vibrant appearance,"
m_ex_flora_02_28,"just like you,"
m_ex_flora_02_29,"but more than that, I find their symbolism to be a perfect match for you.✿"
m_ex_flora_02_30,What does it mean?
m_ex_flora_02_31,Charm.
m_ex_flora_02_32,And you are
m_ex_flora_02_33,the most charming person I know.✿
m_ex_flora_02_34,May I also tell you of a flower that reminds me of you?
m_ex_flora_02_35,A flower that resembles me?
m_ex_flora_02_36,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_flora_02_37,no one has ever told me which flower resembles me.✿
m_ex_flora_02_38,"So, what kind of flower do you think I resemble,"
m_ex_flora_02_39,Blossom?
m_ex_flora_02_40,Lavender.
m_ex_flora_02_41,Iris.
m_ex_flora_02_42,How so?
m_ex_flora_02_43,Because they're beautiful.
m_ex_flora_02_44,Really?✿
m_ex_flora_02_45,That is one of my favorite flowers.
m_ex_flora_02_46,The color suits me wonderfully.
m_ex_flora_02_47,"If that flower reminds you of me,"
m_ex_flora_02_48,then I'll grow some in the garden and give them to you as a gift.
m_ex_flora_02_49,"That way, you'll think of me more often."
m_ex_flora_02_50,That'd be wonderful.
m_ex_flora_02_51,I'll be at the Commander's Room soon.
m_ex_flora_02_52,See you in a few minutes.
m_ex_flora_02_53,See you.
m_ex_flora_02_54,@}>->----
m_ex_flora_03_1,"Blossom,"
m_ex_flora_03_2,"if you're not busy,"
m_ex_flora_03_3,how about a stroll in the garden?✿
m_ex_flora_03_4,The flowers would love to see you.
m_ex_flora_03_5,Which flowers want to see me?
m_ex_flora_03_6,"Flora reads my message, but doesn't reply."
m_ex_flora_03_7,Flora?
m_ex_flora_03_8,Sorry.
m_ex_flora_03_9,"I was asking the flowers, so my reply was delayed."
m_ex_flora_03_10,"The roses, tulips,"
m_ex_flora_03_11,"violas, hydrangeas,"
m_ex_flora_03_12,"daisies, sunflowers,"
m_ex_flora_03_13,and even the lysimachia want to see you.
m_ex_flora_03_14,And...
m_ex_flora_03_15,"Well then, I'll have to come and make an appearance."
m_ex_flora_03_16,That would be lovely!
m_ex_flora_03_17,Do stop by
m_ex_flora_03_18,if you have the time.✿
m_ex_flora_03_19,"I want to see the flowers, but it's you I really want to see, Flora."
m_ex_flora_03_20,"Flora reads my message, but doesn't reply."
m_ex_flora_03_21,Are you there?
m_ex_flora_03_22,I'm sorry.
m_ex_flora_03_23,I was consulting with the flowers again.✿
m_ex_flora_03_24,"This is the first time I've received a message like this,"
m_ex_flora_03_25,so I wasn't sure how to reply.
m_ex_flora_03_26,And what did the flowers suggest that you say?
m_ex_flora_03_27,They told me
m_ex_flora_03_28,to follow my heart.
m_ex_flora_03_29,I also
m_ex_flora_03_30,"want to see you,"
m_ex_flora_03_31,Blossom.✿
m_ex_flora_03_32,Very much so.
m_ex_flora_03_33,I'll come right away.
m_ex_flora_03_34,Okay.✿
m_ex_flora_03_35,I'll be waiting for you in the garden.✿
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_1,Commander.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_2,"Yes, Rapi?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_3,...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_4,Um...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_5,Did you notice?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_6,"Ah, you changed your profile picture."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_7,Notice what?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_8,!!
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_9,You saw it straight away.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_10,Your attention to detail is very attractive.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_11,Oh...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_12,It's just that...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_13,I changed my profile picture.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_14,"Oh, you're right!"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_15,"Anis and Neon suggested that I change it,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_16,so I did.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_17,"If you're not a fan of it,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_18,I can change it back to the way it was.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_19,"No, it's nice."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_20,You think so?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_21,I'm glad you like it.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_22,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_23,How are you feeling?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_24,Sorry?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_25,Are you adjusting to your new look?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_26,Oh.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_27,"Whenever I get back to the Outpost and see my reflection in the mirror at the dorm,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_28,that's when it feels real.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_29,"Not out during operations, but in daily life."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_30,I think this is how I'll live from now on.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_31,Do you like it?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_32,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_33,I do.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_34,So I'm no longer going to worry about it.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_35,This is who I am.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_36,I have sworn to live like this.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_37,"Thank you again,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_38,for showing me the way when I was lost.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_39,I'll continue counting on you like I always have.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_40,And I will do the same.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_41,"Anyway,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_42,I'll remain on standby.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_43,That way... I can come running to you at anytime if I need to.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_44,"If you need anything, anything at all, call me."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_45,"Okay, I'll do that."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_01_46,"Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_1,Commander.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_2,Are you free?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_3,"Today, you mean?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_4,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_5,"I should be, but why?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_6,Maybe... Um...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_7,Would you like to have a drink with me?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_8,You're in the mood for alcohol?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_9,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_10,"A long time ago,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_11,I had a colleague who wanted to drink together to celebrate our becoming friends.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_12,She wanted to use alcohol for us to be more comfortable around each other and get to know each other better.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_13,Thinking back on that
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_14,made me want to share a drink with someone.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_15,I see.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_16,That's why I contacted you.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_17,"I want to drink with you, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_18,Just the two of us?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_19,Yes. No one else.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_20,You want to know more about me?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_21,I do.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_22,And I want to tell you more about me as well.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_23,"It's strange, but that's what I'm feeling right now."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_24,"That doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_25,Not at all. I'm all for it. Let's drink.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_26,Is that really okay?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_27,"Sure, I'd like that."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_28,That's a relief.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_29,I'll prepare some drinks and head over to the Commander's Room.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_30,"Why don't we go buy them, you and I?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_31,"Together, you mean?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_32,Sure.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_33,Let's do that.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_34,I'll wait for you downstairs.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_35,"Oh, and one more thing."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_36,Erm... when we're out buying the drinks...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_37,Could I hold your hand again?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_38,Of course.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_39,Thank you.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_40,I'll get ready and head out soon.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_41,See you in a few minutes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_02_42,See you soon.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_1,"Commander, excuse me, I know you're busy."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_2,What is it?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_3,"If it's all right with you,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_4,may I use the jukebox in the Commander's Room?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_5,"Sure, but what makes you ask?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_6,"Anis and I went to a record shop today,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_7,and I bought a record.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_8,"I want to listen to it,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_9,but I couldn't think of anywhere else I can do that besides the Commander's Room.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_10,You bought a record?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_11,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_12,"I can't really explain why, but it really caught my eye."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_13,"I desperately wanted to listen to it,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_14,so I ended up buying it.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_15,What kind of genre is it?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_16,It's retro music.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_17,Retro?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_18,Yes.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_19,You like retro music?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_20,Honestly?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_21,... No. It's not really my style.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_22,"But for some reason,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_23,I felt drawn to it.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_24,So I bought it.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_25,Is that odd?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_26,Not necessarily. Everyone has moments like that.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_27,They do?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_28,We all have made impulse purchases in our lives.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_29,Impulse purchases...
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_30,I see.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_31,"So many other people do this, not just me."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_32,Of course.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_33,"... Thank you, Commander."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_34,"I also wanted to ask, won't you be bored listening to it by yourself?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_35,"I don't mind, but..."
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_36,"Would you listen with me, Commander?"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_37,If you want me to.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_38,Of course.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_39,I do.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_40,Would you please join me?
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_41,Sure.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_42,Thank you.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_43,Thank you for saying that you'll join me.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_44,"Now that you'll be there with me,"
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_45,I'll be even happier when I get to listen to the music.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_46,I'll see you later.
m_ex_rapi_redhood_03_47,"Yeah, see you."
m_ex_mana_01_1,Hello.
m_ex_mana_01_2,"I'm Mana, a member of M.M.R. squad"
m_ex_mana_01_3,Are you Commander {AccountData.NickName}?
m_ex_mana_01_4,"Yes, that's right."
m_ex_mana_01_5,"You've apparently been given the authority to command me during the surface operation,"
m_ex_mana_01_6,and so I wanted to speak to you about that.
m_ex_mana_01_7,I chose to reach out to you via text because
m_ex_mana_01_8,I don't want to take up too much of your time.
m_ex_mana_01_9,Do you have a moment?
m_ex_mana_01_10,Sure.
m_ex_mana_01_11,Great.
m_ex_mana_01_12,"Before I talk about the operation,"
m_ex_mana_01_13,"I should mention that while I'm a Nikke from the M.M.R. squad,"
m_ex_mana_01_14,I am also a researcher affiliated with the M.M.R. research lab.
m_ex_mana_01_15,Is there any difference?
m_ex_mana_01_16,It's a matter of whether you will view me as a researcher
m_ex_mana_01_17,or a Nikke.
m_ex_mana_01_18,???
m_ex_mana_01_19,To put it simply:
m_ex_mana_01_20,"I am a Nikke assigned to you,"
m_ex_mana_01_21,"but due to my role as an M.M.R. researcher,"
m_ex_mana_01_22,I might often be unable to respond promptly due to my heavy workload.
m_ex_mana_01_23,I wanted to inform you of this in advance
m_ex_mana_01_24,and ask for your understanding.
m_ex_mana_01_25,I hope that won't be a problem?
m_ex_mana_01_26,That's fine.
m_ex_mana_01_27,Thank you for understanding
m_ex_mana_01_28,You must be awfully tired.
m_ex_mana_01_29,What do you mean?
m_ex_mana_01_30,"Since you're affiliated with two different divisions, your workload must be twice as intense."
m_ex_mana_01_31,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_mana_01_32,Well...
m_ex_mana_01_33,That's correct.
m_ex_mana_01_34,There is a lot of work I have to handle.
m_ex_mana_01_35,Quite a lot.
m_ex_mana_01_36,"I wish people would consider that before assigning more tasks,"
m_ex_mana_01_37,but they don't seem to.
m_ex_mana_01_38,"Instead, they only end up giving me more work,"
m_ex_mana_01_39,so I'm always busy.
m_ex_mana_01_40,Would you like me to bring you a coffee?
m_ex_mana_01_41,I'm fine.
m_ex_mana_01_42,"Many of my coworkers are in the same boat as me,"
m_ex_mana_01_43,so there are plenty of coffee machines throughout the lab.
m_ex_mana_01_44,"I appreciate the offer, though."
m_ex_mana_01_45,Hang in there.
m_ex_mana_01_46,I will.
m_ex_mana_01_47,Thank you for the encouragement
m_ex_mana_01_48,Oh dear.
m_ex_mana_01_49,I've gone on for quite a bit.
m_ex_mana_01_50,Do you have anything else that you need to say to me?
m_ex_mana_01_51,"Not at the moment, no."
m_ex_mana_01_52,Understood.
m_ex_mana_01_53,Then I will see you next time when the opportunity arises.
m_ex_mana_01_54,"Yeah, see you later."
m_ex_mana_01_55,See you.
m_ex_mana_02_1,Hello Commander.
m_ex_mana_02_2,It's Mana.
m_ex_mana_02_3,How are you doing?
m_ex_mana_02_4,"Honestly, as much as I'd like to say otherwise,"
m_ex_mana_02_5,I'm not doing so hot.
m_ex_mana_02_6,Huh?
m_ex_mana_02_7,"After all, greetings are important for getting an idea"
m_ex_mana_02_8,how someone is doing.
m_ex_mana_02_9,Something seems off...
m_ex_mana_02_10,Me?
m_ex_mana_02_11,I'm fine.
m_ex_mana_02_12,"I'm having a little drink, sure, but I'm fine."
m_ex_mana_02_13,You're drinking?
m_ex_mana_02_14,Yez
m_ex_mana_02_15,Yes.
m_ex_mana_02_16,Heh.
m_ex_mana_02_17,Hehehehe.
m_ex_mana_02_18,Are you drunk?
m_ex_mana_02_19,No.
m_ex_mana_02_20,I'm totally fine.
m_ex_mana_02_21,"But you know,"
m_ex_mana_02_22,"when I found out that Nikkes can get drunk as well,"
m_ex_mana_02_23,I wa sso oovveryjoyed.
m_ex_mana_02_24,"Whoops, typo, hehe."
m_ex_mana_02_25,"That's all right, I can make a typoe from time to time."
m_ex_mana_02_26,"Oh, there I go again."
m_ex_mana_02_27,Hahahaha!
m_ex_mana_02_28,I feel great.
m_ex_mana_02_29,Seems to me like you're quite drunk.
m_ex_mana_02_30,Me?
m_ex_mana_02_31,Not at all.
m_ex_mana_02_32,I'm simply in a good mood.
m_ex_mana_02_33,I'm not drunk in the slightest.
m_ex_mana_02_34,Have you gone out to a bar?
m_ex_mana_02_35,No.
m_ex_mana_02_36,I'm alone.
m_ex_mana_02_37,You are?
m_ex_mana_02_38,I'm in the dorm.
m_ex_mana_02_39,Where would a researcher like myself go all alone anyway?
m_ex_mana_02_40,"I'm always up to my neck with work, so the lab and the dorm are the only places I go."
m_ex_mana_02_41,Lab. Dorm. Lab. Dorm. Lab. Dorm. Back and forhtg.
m_ex_mana_02_42,"Whhoops, another typo."
m_ex_mana_02_43,Hahaha.
m_ex_mana_02_44,You seem quite inebriated to me.
m_ex_mana_02_45,I've still got all my faculties.
m_ex_mana_02_46,I'm just
m_ex_mana_02_47,in a good mood is all.
m_ex_mana_02_48,In a usper good moood.
m_ex_mana_02_49,"Whoops, another type."
m_ex_mana_02_50,"Meh, I don't think I need to erase it, do I?"
m_ex_mana_02_51,"You don't get bothered about that kinda stuff, do you, Commander?"
m_ex_mana_02_52,"You're not like Syuen, the president, or the CEO."
m_ex_mana_02_53,You wouldn't reprimand me for this kind of thing.
m_ex_mana_02_54,I think it would be best if you stopped drinking.
m_ex_mana_02_55,Huh? Me?
m_ex_mana_02_56,Stoopp?
m_ex_mana_02_57,How many times do I have to tell you?
m_ex_mana_02_58,I'm not drunk.
m_ex_mana_02_59,Mana.
m_ex_mana_02_60,Yes?
m_ex_mana_02_61,Hurry and go to bed.
m_ex_mana_02_62,"I told you, I'm not drunk."
m_ex_mana_02_63,Honeltya.
m_ex_mana_02_64,Honestly.
m_ex_mana_02_65,I'm setious.
m_ex_mana_02_66,Yes you are.
m_ex_mana_02_67,... Okay.
m_ex_mana_02_68,Maybe...
m_ex_mana_02_69,I do feel a bi tireda.
m_ex_mana_02_70,Mana? Are you there?
m_ex_mana_02_71,... No more messages from Mana come through.
m_ex_mana_02_72,"Since it seems that she's fallen asleep, I'll leave her alone."
m_ex_mana_03_1,Hello Commander.
m_ex_mana_03_2,Do you have a moment?
m_ex_mana_03_3,Sure. What's up?
m_ex_mana_03_4,I just wanted to say...
m_ex_mana_03_5,That I'm really sorry about before.
m_ex_mana_03_6,What do you mean?
m_ex_mana_03_7,"I made a fool of myself last time when I drank,"
m_ex_mana_03_8,and I put you
m_ex_mana_03_9,in an awkward position.
m_ex_mana_03_10,I'm really sorry.
m_ex_mana_03_11,It's okay. These things happen.
m_ex_mana_03_12,They shouldn't.
m_ex_mana_03_13,A proper employee would
m_ex_mana_03_14,never allow something like that to happen.
m_ex_mana_03_15,"Not only am I a researcher, but I'm also a Nikke,"
m_ex_mana_03_16,and so the last thing I should be doing is making your life difficult.
m_ex_mana_03_17,Like when I...
m_ex_mana_03_18,"Anyway, once again,"
m_ex_mana_03_19,"I sincerely apologize, Commander."
m_ex_mana_03_20,I really don't mind.
m_ex_mana_03_21,Thank you
m_ex_mana_03_22,for saying that.
m_ex_mana_03_23,"By the way, were you really feeling okay that day?"
m_ex_mana_03_24,Not at all.
m_ex_mana_03_25,"How could I, after drinking as much as I did?"
m_ex_mana_03_26,"Ha, I see."
m_ex_mana_03_27,"I'm fine now, though."
m_ex_mana_03_28,Why did you drink so much in the first place?
m_ex_mana_03_29,Ah.
m_ex_mana_03_30,Well...
m_ex_mana_03_31,Er...
m_ex_mana_03_32,Is it difficult to talk about?
m_ex_mana_03_33,No.
m_ex_mana_03_34,It's the same reason as every other working stiff.
m_ex_mana_03_35,The endless workload and tight schedules.
m_ex_mana_03_36,The constantly changing demands from supervisors.
m_ex_mana_03_37,"It wore me down, is all."
m_ex_mana_03_38,"So to soothe myself,"
m_ex_mana_03_39,I thought I'd have a little drink to lift my spirits.
m_ex_mana_03_40,Just a little.
m_ex_mana_03_41,I see.
m_ex_mana_03_42,"But that ""little drink"" ended up being several."
m_ex_mana_03_43,And then I ended up causing you trouble.
m_ex_mana_03_44,It's okay. I understand.
m_ex_mana_03_45,Thank you for being so understanding.
m_ex_mana_03_46,"Next time, don't drink alone and reach out to me."
m_ex_mana_03_47,What?
m_ex_mana_03_48,You'd be willing to drink with me when I want to have a few?
m_ex_mana_03_49,Sure. It's lonely drinking alone.
m_ex_mana_03_50,Oh wow.
m_ex_mana_03_51,"I'd really like that,"
m_ex_mana_03_52,but are you sure you're okay with it?
m_ex_mana_03_53,"As you've seen,"
m_ex_mana_03_54,I can't exactly handle my alcohol all that well.
m_ex_mana_03_55,That's fine. I'll get drunk along with you.
m_ex_mana_03_56,I see.
m_ex_mana_03_57,"Well,"
m_ex_mana_03_58,"in that case,"
m_ex_mana_03_59,I'll reach out to you
m_ex_mana_03_60,the next time I feel like drinking.
m_ex_mana_03_61,"Okay, I'll be waiting."
m_ex_mmr_03_1,"No. 7, Mana."
m_ex_mmr_03_2,Yes?
m_ex_mmr_03_3,What is it?
m_ex_mmr_03_4,Are either of you hungry?
m_ex_mmr_03_5,?
m_ex_mmr_03_6,Right now?
m_ex_mmr_03_7,Yes.
m_ex_mmr_03_8,Right now.
m_ex_mmr_03_9,Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
m_ex_mmr_03_10,Because I'm hungry :)
m_ex_mmr_03_11,"Aren't you famished too, Mana?"
m_ex_mmr_03_12,You've had your nose to the grindstone since yesterday
m_ex_mmr_03_13,and you haven't had a chance to eat anything.
m_ex_mmr_03_14,"Even if you're a Nikke, going for so long without food"
m_ex_mmr_03_15,isn't good for your mental health.
m_ex_mmr_03_16,What's been keeping you so busy that you haven't been able to eat?
m_ex_mmr_03_17,The same story as with all working people.
m_ex_mmr_03_18,Impromptu visits from the higher-ups.
m_ex_mmr_03_19,Impromptu meetings being scheduled.
m_ex_mmr_03_20,Impromptu demands of us turning in research reports.
m_ex_mmr_03_21,Ether.
m_ex_mmr_03_22,I think it would be best if you stopped talking.
m_ex_mmr_03_23,"Hehe, you're probably right."
m_ex_mmr_03_24,I like venting to No. 7 so much that
m_ex_mmr_03_25,I nearly badmouthed my boss!
m_ex_mmr_03_26,"You truly are an exceptional individual, No. 7."
m_ex_mmr_03_27,I think you just wanted to let off some steam.
m_ex_mmr_03_28,"Ha, you think so?"
m_ex_mmr_03_29,"Anyway, do either of you want to go eat something?"
m_ex_mmr_03_30,Why don't we get whatever it is you want?
m_ex_mmr_03_31,"That's kind of you,"
m_ex_mmr_03_32,"but I'm too lazy to think right now, so I thought I'd ask you all instead."
m_ex_mmr_03_33,I figured as much.
m_ex_mmr_03_34,I'm exhausted.
m_ex_mmr_03_35,The only thing I want right now is some sleep.
m_ex_mmr_03_36,Yeah?
m_ex_mmr_03_37,"Hmm, maybe I should do the same."
m_ex_mmr_03_38,I'm too lazy to choose what to eat.
m_ex_mmr_03_39,"What do you think we should do, No. 7?"
m_ex_mmr_03_40,"Ether, for goodness sake."
m_ex_mmr_03_41,Surely you can make that decision on your own?
m_ex_mmr_03_42,"Nah, too lazy. Don't feel like choosing."
m_ex_mmr_03_43,Then just sleep.
m_ex_mmr_03_44,Okie dokie :)
m_ex_mmr_03_45,Good night everyone.
m_ex_mmr_03_46,Good night.
m_ex_mmr_03_47,"Sorry about that, Commander."
m_ex_mmr_03_48,"You should hurry to bed too, Mana."
m_ex_mmr_03_49,"Yes, I'll go get some rest as well."
m_ex_mmr_03_50,"You should follow suit, Commander."
m_ex_mmr_03_51,"I will. Now go rest up, you've earned it."
m_ex_mmr_04_1,"What are you up to, No. 7?"
m_ex_mmr_04_2,I'm bored. Why don't you come over to M.M.R.?
m_ex_mmr_04_3,I'll pass.
m_ex_mmr_04_4,Right now?
m_ex_mmr_04_5,Ouch. Harsh.
m_ex_mmr_04_6,Can't you at least think it over?
m_ex_mmr_04_7,I'm bored out of my gourd over here.
m_ex_mmr_04_8,"Yes, right now."
m_ex_mmr_04_9,Because I'm bored right now.
m_ex_mmr_04_10,?
m_ex_mmr_04_11,Why are you bored?
m_ex_mmr_04_12,Don't you have a report that's due today?
m_ex_mmr_04_13,"I do,"
m_ex_mmr_04_14,but I can't write it right now.
m_ex_mmr_04_15,???
m_ex_mmr_04_16,Why not?
m_ex_mmr_04_17,Don't you remember?
m_ex_mmr_04_18,They're doing maintenance in the building today.
m_ex_mmr_04_19,They are?
m_ex_mmr_04_20,What kind of maintenance?
m_ex_mmr_04_21,They're doing a routine power check-in at Level D.
m_ex_mmr_04_22,Electricity is only going to be routed to essential areas and equipment.
m_ex_mmr_04_23,Everything else will be shut off temporarily.
m_ex_mmr_04_24,I didn't see any announcement.
m_ex_mmr_04_25,It was posted this morning.
m_ex_mmr_04_26,When exactly is it scheduled?
m_ex_mmr_04_27,Any minute now.
m_ex_mmr_04_28,What?! But I haven't saved my report y...
m_ex_mmr_04_29,Huh?
m_ex_mmr_04_30,I think the power just went out.
m_ex_mmr_04_31,Mana? Are you okay?
m_ex_mmr_04_32,... There's no response from Mana.
m_ex_mmr_04_33,Hmm...
m_ex_mmr_04_34,That can't be good.
m_ex_mmr_04_35,Mana?
m_ex_mmr_04_36,... Still no response.
m_ex_mmr_04_37,Should I go check on her?
m_ex_mmr_04_38,No.
m_ex_mmr_04_39,Don't come.
m_ex_mmr_04_40,It's all over.
m_ex_mmr_04_41,Over?
m_ex_mmr_04_42,Were you not able to save it?
m_ex_mmr_04_43,... No.
m_ex_mmr_04_44,Oh dear.
m_ex_mmr_04_45,Are you okay?
m_ex_mmr_04_46,I'm fine.
m_ex_mmr_04_47,I can just write it again.
m_ex_mmr_04_48,The entire thing.
m_ex_mmr_04_49,That's all I need to do.
m_ex_mmr_04_50,"Since the power's out,"
m_ex_mmr_04_51,I guess I'll take a quick break.
m_ex_mmr_04_52,... Hang in there.
m_ex_mmr_04_53,...
m_ex_mmr_04_54,I'm going to take a short break.
m_ex_mmr_04_55,... Okay.
m_ex_mmr_04_56,Yikes.
m_ex_mmr_04_57,Mana is really going through it right now.
m_ex_mmr_04_58,Oh.
m_ex_mmr_04_59,I better go and cheer her up.
m_ex_mmr_04_60,I think it might be better not to.
m_ex_mmr_04_61,Why?
m_ex_mmr_04_62,It seems to me like she needs some alone time.
m_ex_mmr_04_63,You think so?
m_ex_mmr_04_64,"I'll go ask. If she says she wants to be alone, then I'll just come back ;)"
m_ex_mmr_04_65,Since I'm bored.
m_ex_mmr_04_66,... All right.
m_ex_aegis_05_1,"Yo, Ho, Ho! Split the sea asunder!"
m_ex_aegis_05_2,"Yo, Ho, Ho! Azure waves dance as we plunder!"
m_ex_aegis_05_3,"Underneath a blazing sun, we're off to find treasures, son!"
m_ex_aegis_05_4,"Yo, Ho, Ho, raise your swords high!"
m_ex_aegis_05_5,"Yo, Ho, Ho, hoist the flag to the sky!"
m_ex_aegis_05_6,"Pirates we be, and we set sail to chase"
m_ex_aegis_05_7,"our dream of freedom, which none can replace!"
m_ex_aegis_05_8,How does that sound?
m_ex_aegis_05_9,What's going on?
m_ex_aegis_05_10,Did you write this?
m_ex_aegis_05_11,"We be singing a song that I wrote, aye!"
m_ex_aegis_05_12,"Aye, that I did!"
m_ex_aegis_05_13,Can't you feel the pirate's spirit coursing through you?
m_ex_aegis_05_14,Not sure...
m_ex_aegis_05_15,"Yes, I can feel it!"
m_ex_aegis_05_16,What's all this about?
m_ex_aegis_05_17,*Gasp*!
m_ex_aegis_05_18,*Gasp*!
m_ex_aegis_05_19,The fearsome sea witch has appeared!
m_ex_aegis_05_20,"Anchors aweigh, mateys! Master Captain, man the battle stations!"
m_ex_aegis_05_21,Roger!
m_ex_aegis_05_22,Huh?
m_ex_aegis_05_23,"Aye aye, captain!"
m_ex_aegis_05_24,Good grief.
m_ex_aegis_05_25,"Ever since you put on that pirate outfit,"
m_ex_aegis_05_26,you've gotten much worse.
m_ex_aegis_05_27,"Port side, all cannons! Prepare to fire!"
m_ex_aegis_05_28,Heave-ho!
m_ex_aegis_05_29,Enough of this silliness.
m_ex_aegis_05_30,Fire!
m_ex_aegis_05_31,*Boom boom boom KABOOM!*
m_ex_aegis_05_32,Subordinate.
m_ex_aegis_05_33,"Subordinate, I can see you're reading this."
m_ex_aegis_05_34,Answer.
m_ex_aegis_05_35,Er... hi.
m_ex_aegis_05_36,"We're still alive, foul Sea Witch!"
m_ex_aegis_05_37,Could you please
m_ex_aegis_05_38,do something about this?
m_ex_aegis_05_39,Do something about what?
m_ex_aegis_05_40,You know what I'm referring to.
m_ex_aegis_05_41,I think I'm as powerless to stop it as you are.
m_ex_aegis_05_42,... I can't believe this.
m_ex_aegis_05_43,"Oh boy, we're in big trouble now..."
m_ex_aegis_05_44,"Our messages show up as read, but Helm doesn't reply for a while."
m_ex_aegis_05_45,Helm?
m_ex_aegis_05_46,"Master,"
m_ex_aegis_05_47,I just heard a strange noise from the next room.
m_ex_aegis_05_48,What kind of noise?
m_ex_aegis_05_49,It sounded like a scream or something.
m_ex_aegis_05_50,Wait.
m_ex_aegis_05_51,Now something's breaking.
m_ex_aegis_05_52,Uh oh.
m_ex_aegis_05_53,I don't think Mast is the one doing it.
m_ex_aegis_05_54,Now it seems like no one is reading my messages.
m_ex_aegis_05_55,Guys?
m_ex_aegis_05_56,Subordinate.
m_ex_aegis_05_57,The Aegis Squad will be leaving for a two-week training camp without delay.
m_ex_aegis_05_58,"It's an urgent matter,"
m_ex_aegis_05_59,so we'll have to obtain approval after the fact.
m_ex_aegis_05_60,I trust that you'll understand.
m_ex_aegis_05_61,I do.
m_ex_aegis_06_1,Master.
m_ex_aegis_06_2,I like you♡
m_ex_aegis_06_3,I like you a lot too.
m_ex_aegis_06_4,What the...
m_ex_aegis_06_5,What is this?
m_ex_aegis_06_6,What are you two doing?
m_ex_aegis_06_7,"You don't get it, Helm."
m_ex_aegis_06_8,The Master likes this kind of thing.
m_ex_aegis_06_9,"Actually, he likes whatever we do."
m_ex_aegis_06_10,And you know why?
m_ex_aegis_06_11,That's because...
m_ex_aegis_06_12,we're maids!
m_ex_aegis_06_13,Ta-da!
m_ex_aegis_06_14,"I know you've been frequenting maid cafes rather often, but that's due to professional obligations."
m_ex_aegis_06_15,It's got nothing to do with your personal prefersancs.
m_ex_aegis_06_16,"Preferences, I meant."
m_ex_aegis_06_17,Prefersancs! Nice one!
m_ex_aegis_06_18,Prefersancs!
m_ex_aegis_06_19,Haha.
m_ex_aegis_06_20,Anyway.
m_ex_aegis_06_21,"If you two keep talking like that, you'll be making it rather awkward for Subordinate."
m_ex_aegis_06_22,I'm fine with it.
m_ex_aegis_06_23,!
m_ex_aegis_06_24,?
m_ex_aegis_06_25,??
m_ex_aegis_06_26,I think you broke Helm.
m_ex_aegis_06_27,"But Helm, if he likes the way we talk to him,"
m_ex_aegis_06_28,and you're trying to prevent us from doing that...
m_ex_aegis_06_29,Does that mean you dislike Master Captain?
m_ex_aegis_06_30,That's not what I meant!
m_ex_aegis_06_31,"You don't dislike him,"
m_ex_aegis_06_32,but you don't like him either?
m_ex_aegis_06_33,You are insufferably childish.
m_ex_aegis_06_34,I'm going to bed.
m_ex_aegis_06_35,So predictable.
m_ex_aegis_06_36,Okay.
m_ex_aegis_06_37,Mast has sent a video.
m_ex_aegis_06_38,"Sure enough, no response from Helm."
m_ex_aegis_06_39,{AccountData.NickName} has sent you a gift card!
m_ex_aegis_06_40,Wow.
m_ex_aegis_06_41,Helm still isn't looking.
m_ex_aegis_06_42,"If we keep this up, Helm is gonna be super mad at us."
m_ex_aegis_06_43,"All right, Master Captain,"
m_ex_aegis_06_44,this is where you come in.
m_ex_aegis_06_45,"Helm is clearly just gazing at the notifications on her phone screen without paying real attention,"
m_ex_aegis_06_46,so you've gotta get her to actually click on the notifications and get back into the group chat.
m_ex_aegis_06_47,"Sorry, Helm."
m_ex_aegis_06_48,"I'm quite fond of you, Helm."
m_ex_aegis_06_49,Hmm...
m_ex_aegis_06_50,Looks like she's still not reading the messages.
m_ex_aegis_06_51,She's probably just glancing at the notifications
m_ex_aegis_06_52,so that she doesn't give us the satisfaction of knowing she's seeing our messages.
m_ex_aegis_06_53,"Yeah, I'm inclined to agree."
m_ex_aegis_06_54,Same here.
m_ex_aegis_06_55,Then it's unanimous!
m_ex_aegis_06_56,"Helm is clearly lying on her bed using the notifications to steal glances at our messages without them showing up as ""read""."
m_ex_aegis_06_57,"I can see her feet in the air right now, wiggling about with excitement."
m_ex_aegis_06_58,*Clap clap clap clap clap*
m_ex_aegis_06_59,Oh!
m_ex_aegis_06_60,She read the messages.
m_ex_aegis_06_61,Subordinate.
m_ex_aegis_06_62,You've been playing too many pranks lately.
m_ex_aegis_06_63,I hope Mast and Anchor aren't rubbing off on you too much.
m_ex_aegis_06_64,Sorry...
m_ex_aegis_06_65,"Now, as for the Maid Cafe, don't..."
m_ex_aegis_06_66,...
m_ex_aegis_06_67,Just don't overdo it.
m_ex_aegis_06_68,"Actually,"
m_ex_aegis_06_69,I'd like to see the place for myself.
m_ex_aegis_06_70,"Next time, let's go together."
m_ex_aegis_06_71,Sure.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_1,*Knock knock*
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_2,Yes?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_3,"I'm coming in, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_4,*The door slams open*
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_5,Why would you hurl the door open?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_6,Oh.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_7,Sorry.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_8,Let me do it again.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_9,*Knock knock*
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_10,Yes?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_11,"I'm coming in, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_12,Anchor doesn't reply for quite a while.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_13,How should I describe
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_14,the sound of opening a door
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_15,more carefully?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_16,*Creak*?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_17,*Slide*?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_18,"No matter what I do,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_19,the door's gonna make a sound.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_20,"And then you'll chew me out,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_21,and I won't even get to eat the usual table scraps that I manage to save in time.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_22,I'd end up going hungry until tomorrow morning.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_23,"Come on, that's not true."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_24,It's not?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_25,No.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_26,"So even if I make noise while opening the door, you won't scold me?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_27,No.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_28,And you won't yell at me
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_29,if I mess up a whole bunch
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_30,while doing chores around the house?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_31,Of course not.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_32,Sweet!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_33,"You're the best, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_34,So you wouldn't reprimand me
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_35,even if you found out
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_36,that I put a sea squirt
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_37,in your pants pocket earlier?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_38,"I quickly check my pants pockets, which are fortunately bereft of a sea squirt."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_39,Got ya!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_40,You nearly gave me a heart attack.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_41,"You won't get mad, will you?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_42,"There's no reason I would ever get mad at you, Anchor."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_43,Hehe.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_44,"Oh, by the way."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_45,"Now that I've officially introduced myself,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_46,I just wanna say that I'll be at your service from here on out.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_01_47,I hope you have a good day.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_1,"Master,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_2,I prepared something a bit different today.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_3,You being dressed as a maid is already plenty unique.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_4,"Is it, though?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_5,"Aside from a change of outfit and tying my hair up,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_6,it's not all that different.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_7,"As they say, the clothes make the man."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_8,"Hehe,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_9,I see.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_10,"Oh, but this time,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_11,we'll be doing things a little differently.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_12,Why don't you put this on for me?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_13,"What do you mean by ""doing things differently""?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_14,"This time,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_15,"I'll be the customer,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_16,and you'll be the maid.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_17,Do we really need to change our clothes for that?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_18,"Besides, wouldn't it be more appropriate for me to be a butler?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_19,"Honestly, it doesn't matter all that much."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_20,I'm just interested in having you
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_21,do all the things I usually do for you.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_22,Like what?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_23,"Like giving me a pat on the shoulder,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_24,"accompanying me as I take my starfish for a walk,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_25,or backing me up whenever I fake being sick.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_26,"You know, stuff like that."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_27,... You've never done any of those things for me.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_28,"Ugh, whatever!"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_29,"Just do it, pleaaaaaasseeeee?!"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_30,"I can do everything you asked, except for that last one."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_31,No way! It's a package deal.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_32,"If I nix that one, the other two are a no-go as well."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_33,"Why do we have to do this today, anyway? Can't we do it another time?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_34,"No, it has to be today."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_35,"Otherwise, Helm is gonna make sure I'm sleeping with the fishes."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_36,!!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_37,"It was an honor to serve you, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_38,I hope you can find peace once I'm gone.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_39,Hahaha. Why did you fake being sick in the first place anyway?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_40,Because I wanted some free time
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_41,"to do the other two things with you, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_42,Hmm...
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_43,"It's fine, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_44,Trony's already taught me how to write a will.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_45,"Let me know when you have time, and we can do some of those things together."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_02_46,Okay!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_1,and they can make some new friends.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_2,"I can bring my sea creatures with me,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_3,??
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_4,what activities should we get up to?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_5,"So,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_6,"when we go to the beach this summer,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_7,What is going on?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_8,"Oh, sorry."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_9,"The signal started acting up,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_10,so the messages got sent out of order.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_11,"So, when we go to the beach this summer, what activities should we get up to? I can bring my sea creatures with me, and they can make some new friends."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_12,That's the order they should have been in.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_13,"I guess my being a maid has weakened my abilities,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_14,and the signal is being negatively affected.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_15,"Ha, you think so?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_16,Yeah.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_17,"Trony says that when you change jobs,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_18,your stats and skills change along with it.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_19,"So I'm unable to use my radar skills right now,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_20,which would explain
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_21,why the signal's all wonky.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_22,But shouldn't you have obtained new maid skills in their place?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_23,"You're right, and not just any ordinary maid's skills."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_24,I've obtained those as part of a secret profession:
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_25,A swimsuit-clad maid!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_26,"Wow, very nice!"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_27,"Swimsuit maids aren't as proficient at normal maid-based skills,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_28,but they get a serious power boost
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_29,when they're near water.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_30,Does that include places like swimming pools?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_31,"Yeah, as long as it's water, it counts."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_32,So it seems like I'm stronger
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_33,"in the kitchen, which has a sink, than the hall, which doesn't."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_34,"Then at the beach, you'll be way stronger, right?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_35,I can only imagine!
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_36,"But this time, instead of horsing around,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_37,I'm really gonna focus on my maid-related tasks.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_38,"Cooking, cleaning, organizing,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_39,"taking the starfish for a walk,"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_40,hunting for sea creatures.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_41,Those last two parts don't sound quite right...
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_42,Are those all really maid-related tasks?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_43,A true maid is capable of doing anything.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_44,At least that's what Ade told me.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_45,"There's an element of truth to that, but..."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_46,... Yes?
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_47,"Anyway, I'm sure you've made a lot of new friends recently."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_48,"I have, but you're still the apple of my eye, Master."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_49,"In fact, can I come over now?"
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_50,Sure.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_51,"All right, I'll be there soon."
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_52,Don't miss me too much in the meantime.
m_ex_anchor_innocentmaid_03_53,"Haha, all right."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_1,Hehehehe...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_2,Hahahahaha!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_3,HAHAHAHAHA!!!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_4,"Ha, you're really over the moon about this, aren't you?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_5,"Of course, I am!"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_6,This is the best moment of my life.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_7,"No, even more than that."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_8,I was born for this very day!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_9,Congratulations.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_10,"Rather than a simple congratulations,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_11,I'd like to hear an evaluation.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_12,What do you think of this glorious new form o' mine?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_13,I can't remember how the outfit looked.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_14,"Judging by your profile picture, I can't really tell."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_15,What?!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_16,Wait a moment.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_17,"I wait for a while as, I presume, Mast takes a picture of herself."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_18,Hmm...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_19,Master Captain.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_20,Yes?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_21,I just...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_22,realized something.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_23,Taking a full-body selfie...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_24,kinda makes me self-conscious.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_25,What do you mean?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_26,Hear me out.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_27,This outfit is so revealing.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_28,"Any photo I take will exist forever, won't it?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_29,"Even if it's you who I'm sending it to,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_30,I still am a bit nervous about the whole thing...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_31,Does being a pirate make you embarrassed?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_32,Does being a maid make you embarrassed?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_33,This has nothing to do with that!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_34,All I've been thinking about is
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_35,whether or not this outfit is too revealing.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_36,"And then when you go and say something like that, I..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_37,I think it's great.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_38,...I love to hear it.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_39,So it seems
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_40,I was right after all.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_41,There's nothing better than a pirate maid.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_42,Couldn't have said it better myself.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_43,"But, er..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_44,I'm still too embarrassed to send that photo.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_45,"Why don't you come on over and see it for yourself, instead?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_46,I'd be down for that anytime!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_01_47,"Ha, all right."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_1,"Master Captain,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_2,get back to me as soon as you see this.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_3,What's up?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_4,Thank goodness.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_5,Can you come to the Maid Cafe right now?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_6,What's going on?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_7,"I just want to see you, that's all."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_8,?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_9,?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_10,What?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_11,Is that so strange of me to want that?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_12,It's just so sudden.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_13,"When you like someone,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_14,you find yourself wanting to see them all the time.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_15,"In everyday moments, in sudden and unexpected ones."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_16,"All the time, really."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_17,I like you too.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_18,I want to see you too.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_19,!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_20,"Oh, er..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_21,I didn't expect that we'd take it this far.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_22,I really do like you.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_23,!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_24,O-okay!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_25,That's enough!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_26,What's wrong?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_27,"If you're gonna say stuff like that,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_28,shouldn't you tell it to me in person
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_29,instead of over Bla?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_30,All right then!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_31,Come and meet me at the Maid Cafe.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_32,"We've got plenty of staff on hand,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_33,so you won't get roped into working.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_34,"You can come as you are,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_35,nice and relaxed.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_36,"All right, I'll come in sweats."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_37,"All right. I haven't showered yet, but I'll head straight over."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_38,"Um, actually, that might be a bit..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_39,Didn't you say I could come as I was?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_40,I meant that you could come here without any mental stress.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_41,I didn't mean not to tend to your physical appearance.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_42,Oh. Fair enough.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_43,"Aye, that be right!"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_44,"All right, I'll head right over. We can eat together after you're done."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_45,When I'm done with what?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_46,"Anyway,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_47,sharing a meal sounds like a grand idea!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_48,I'll prepare something special for you.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_49,The squishy-wishy ♥ boing-boing ♡ super-duper ☆special★!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_02_50,"Haha, sounds good."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_1,"Today was a long day for both of us, Master Captain."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_2,"Would you like to eat first, or have a bath?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_3,Both are services which I can provide.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_4,"Although, having said that..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_5,??
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_6,Could it be that
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_7,you want to choose me?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_8,"I, Mast, the most daring pirate maid who sailed the high seas?!"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_9,"I'm pretty hungry, so I'll eat first."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_10,I should clean up a bit.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_11,I'd like to spend time with you.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_12,You chose food over me?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_13,How hungry can you possibly be?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_14,"Of course, I'll tend to you either way, but..."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_15,"If you pick spending time with me, isn't it safe to assume food automatically comes with that?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_16,"Haha, all right. I'll hang out with you."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_17,"I appreciate that,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_18,but why don't you think it over one more time?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_19,"If you pick me, it won't be a one-time thing."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_20,You'll be signing up for continuous service in the future!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_21,"Haha, all right. I'll hang out with you."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_22,I appreciate your frankness!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_23,"For being such a wonderful shipmate,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_24,"I'll be givin' you all three as a reward, arr!"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_25,Haha.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_26,"You're a lucky landlubber, Captain."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_27,You've got a superlative pirate maid like me
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_28,"feeding you, washing you,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_29,and even...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_30,Even what?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_31,...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_32,What were you about to say?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_33,Er... nothing!
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_34,"Come on, what is it?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_35,*Sigh*... You really are quite the character.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_36,Do I really have to say it out loud?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_37,"I'd like to hear it directly from you, yes."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_38,Hm...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_39,Well...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_40,I could even...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_41,give you a kiss.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_42,I'd like that.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_43,...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_44,Uh...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_45,"This may be a little strange,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_46,"especially when I'm the one who brought it up,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_47,but are you sure that
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_48,a kiss is enough?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_49,After all this time
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_50,"we've been spending together,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_51,I'm not sure if that'll be sufficient.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_52,"I know, I know that this sounds totally bizarre."
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_53,But don't you agree with me?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_54,?
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_55,"I offer you a kiss, and that's the reaction I get?"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_56,It's just that I think I'll need more to be satisfied.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_57,"If that's the case,"
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_58,you decide
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_59,what happens next.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_60,We'll both decide at the moment.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_61,Got ti.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_62,Got it.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_63,Uh...
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_64,I'll be in my room.
m_ex_mast_romanticmaid_03_65,Come as quickly as you can.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_1,Mast has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_2,Mast has invited Sin to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_3,Mast has invited Anchor to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_4,Mast has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_5,Trony left the group chat.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_6,Mast has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_7,Trony left the group chat.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_8,Argh!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_9,I'll try sending her a private message.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_10,Haha.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_11,I think I saw her in the kitchen.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_12,Thanks for the tip.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_13,What's going on with the group chat name?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_14,Mast said she'd leave if we didn't go with that name.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_15,Mast has invited Trony to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_16,I'll change it later and be discreet about it.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_17,"Don't you dare,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_18,or else I'll leave for real.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_19,"Whoops, guess I got caught, hehe."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_20,Did you all find Trony?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_21,There's a commotion coming from the kitchen.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_22,Hahaha.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_23,"Phew, got here."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_24,"All right, Trony,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_25,say something in the chat.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_26,Oops.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_27,I think she's crying...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_28,"It's all right, Trony, speak up."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_29,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_30,?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_31,"Come on, Trony."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_32,"It's okay, Trony. Go on."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_33,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_34,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_35,"At any rate, now that everyone's here,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_36,Allow me to introduce the group chat for us adventurous maids!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_37,Omurice!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_38,I've got omurice if anyone wants it!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_39,We're nearly done converting the place into a pirate cafe.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_40,It looks amazing!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_41,We'll be opening for business soon.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_42,"You should come and check it out, Master!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_43,"Anchor, please. We all could stand to show some professionalism."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_44,"Are you in the kitchen right now, Anchor?"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_45,"Anyway, as I was trying to say,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_46,we should all strive to do our best.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_47,I want some of that omurice Anchor was talking about!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_48,I'll get some plates and bring them over.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_49,We can eat in the hall.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_50,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_51,"Are you not joining us, Mast?"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_52,Mast left the group chat.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_53,"Haha,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_54,I'm having way too much fun with this.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_55,Anchor has invited Mast to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_56,"Sorry about that, Mast."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_57,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_58,We can talk more while we eat our omurice.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_59,Got it.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_01_60,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_1,Buddy?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_2,Do you need anything?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_3,He lp Masttt and Anchor are fllan k ing me tickling both m y sieds.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_4,Ha! I'm afraid that's not allowed.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_5,This really is a lot of fun.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_6,"Maybe I'm imagining things, but I feel like I hear creaking sounds."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_7,Must be Master Captain grinding his teeth.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_8,"Please, spare me."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_9,"Oh, now you're in for it!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_10,"As I desperately try to focus on my phone, Mast starts to tickle me more aggressively."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_11,"Even while all this happening,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_12,you're still holding onto your phone and trying to reply to me.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_13,How touching! 50 points for you.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_14,Or he could just be addicted to his phone.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_15,I need to focus. I can hold out.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_16,"Come on, why don't you give in and just enjoy it?"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_17,It's not like we mean any harm.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_18,Exactly.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_19,"You're the one who's at fault here, you... you spineless piece of garbage!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_20,Wow.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_21,I should've taken a picture of Trony typing just now.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_22,She looked like a complete fanatic.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_23,Has she finally come to terms with how she feels inside?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_24,"I hadn't considered kidnapping again, but if Trony insists..."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_25,That's not what I mean...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_26,"Well, if there's nothing else you need, we..."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_27,Uh oh.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_28,Looks like Trony bought a rope.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_29,???
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_30,Perfect.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_31,Master Captain was starting to resist a little too much...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_32,My escape attempt is quickly thwarted by Mast and Elegg.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_33,Phew.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_34,What is it?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_35,"Master tried to escape,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_36,but Mast and Elegg caught him.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_37,Unforgivable.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_38,"Haha, nicely done!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_02_39,I'll be there soon.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_1,Today's the last day we'll be in business at the pirate cafe.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_2,I already know that
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_3,I'll look back on my time here fondly.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_4,"Buddy, we've got a big problem."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_5,What it is?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_6,"Yes, I'll never forget the memories I've forged here..."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_7,Look outside.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_8,"We're not even open yet, and there's already a line."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_9,There are more people out there than we'd had on entire days before.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_10,"Indeed, the time I've spent here is..."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_11,Do we have enough stock?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_12,"We should have enough, but just barely."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_13,"It looks like more people are coming, so we'll need to buy more."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_14,HEY?!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_15,What's the big idea with all of you? I'm trying to wax poetic here!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_16,"Sorry, but you'll have to save it for the afterparty."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_17,"What are we doing for that, by the way?"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_18,Let's go somewhere special!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_19,"If special is what you want, then we have to go to the sea!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_20,Oooh!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_21,...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_22,You all have fun out there.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_23,Trony left the group chat.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_24,Ha! Hilarious.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_25,"Mast, take Trony and go buy more ingredients."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_26,Got it!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_03_27,Let's see this adventure through to the end!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_1,Mast has invited Privaty to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_2,Mast has invited Milk to join the group.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_3,??
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_4,What's this?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_5,A group for my excetionally brilliant
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_6,madde
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_7,maid friends.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_8,???
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_9,I think she's drunk too much.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_10,I told her to take it easy with the drinking.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_11,I've never seen anyone polish off an entire barrel by themselves.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_12,"Heha... annyway, Privaty is..."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_13,What the...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_14,"Looks like Master is pretty sauced as well, haha."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_15,But the Commander barely drank anything!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_16,That stuff was super strong.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_17,"70 percent ABV, I believe."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_18,Did you say 70 percent?!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_19,"Mast pulled out her secret stash,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_20,and only shared it with Master :(
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_21,That explains why those two are the only ones who got trashed.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_22,"Commander,"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_23,did you make it back to your room safely?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_24,Yeah.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_25,Good.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_26,Make sure to go to bed early tonight.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_27,Il lvoe you all.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_28,!!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_29,Commander...
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_30,Was that a typo?
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_31,"Love you too, Master!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_32,"Could we change the topic, please?!"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_33,"Goodnight, Master. I love you."
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_34,Olve you
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_35,Goobnight.
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_36,Hold on!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_37,Good grief!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_38,Commander! Tell me you didn't mean to type that!
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_39,"I go away for a second to clean up, and this is what I come back to?"
m_ex_romanticvalentine_04_40,Commander!!!
m_ex_trina_01_1,"Oh my goodness,"
m_ex_trina_01_2,Sun!
m_ex_trina_01_3,Is that really you?
m_ex_trina_01_4,The one and only.
m_ex_trina_01_5,"No, you must have me mistaken for someone else."
m_ex_trina_01_6,I knew it!
m_ex_trina_01_7,This is so wonderful!
m_ex_trina_01_8,It feels like we've found a little space just for the two of us.
m_ex_trina_01_9,That's good to hear.
m_ex_trina_01_10,"Haha,"
m_ex_trina_01_11,don't be silly.
m_ex_trina_01_12,You're too friendly to fool me.
m_ex_trina_01_13,"After all, you're Sun."
m_ex_trina_01_14,You caught me.
m_ex_trina_01_15,Hehe.
m_ex_trina_01_16,"This may end up being a problem, actually. I should be focusing on my work."
m_ex_trina_01_17,"Now that you mention it, what exactly is it that you do, Trina?"
m_ex_trina_01_18,What do I do?
m_ex_trina_01_19,"Well,"
m_ex_trina_01_20,"I suppose if I were to put it simply,"
m_ex_trina_01_21,I'd say that
m_ex_trina_01_22,I take care of all the little ones who live in the Ark.
m_ex_trina_01_23,Little ones?
m_ex_trina_01_24,That's right.
m_ex_trina_01_25,You have children?
m_ex_trina_01_26,"Haha,"
m_ex_trina_01_27,you could say that.
m_ex_trina_01_28,I suppose you're curious as to what exactly I mean?
m_ex_trina_01_29,"Indeed, I am. Tell me more."
m_ex_trina_01_30,"Well,"
m_ex_trina_01_31,the little ones may seem strong
m_ex_trina_01_32,"and intimidating at first,"
m_ex_trina_01_33,"but when you look closely,"
m_ex_trina_01_34,they can be positively adorable.
m_ex_trina_01_35,??
m_ex_trina_01_36,"Some of them are small,"
m_ex_trina_01_37,and others are large.
m_ex_trina_01_38,Oh!
m_ex_trina_01_39,"If you come visit my arboretum, you can see them."
m_ex_trina_01_40,"Ah, I get it now."
m_ex_trina_01_41,Haha.
m_ex_trina_01_42,I take it you understand now?
m_ex_trina_01_43,Yes. You're referring to the trees.
m_ex_trina_01_44,"Hehe, that's right!"
m_ex_trina_01_45,"Someday,"
m_ex_trina_01_46,I'll introduce you to them.
m_ex_trina_01_47,"Sure, I'd like that."
m_ex_trina_01_48,"I'm not sure exactly when that day will be,"
m_ex_trina_01_49,but I hope that it's sometime soon.
m_ex_trina_01_50,I'm looking forward to it as well.
m_ex_trina_02_1,"Hi, Sun."
m_ex_trina_02_2,What lovely weather we're having today.
m_ex_trina_02_3,The little ones and I
m_ex_trina_02_4,are at the Park.
m_ex_trina_02_5,Did you go with the birds?
m_ex_trina_02_6,"Yes, I did."
m_ex_trina_02_7,They're usually quite timid
m_ex_trina_02_8,"and always stick close to me,"
m_ex_trina_02_9,but they must be in a great mood today
m_ex_trina_02_10,as they went off soaring on their own.
m_ex_trina_02_11,The weather really is spectacular today.
m_ex_trina_02_12,"Hehe,"
m_ex_trina_02_13,isn't it just?
m_ex_trina_02_14,The temperature is just right
m_ex_trina_02_15,for a lovely outing.
m_ex_trina_02_16,"In fact,"
m_ex_trina_02_17,"if you're free,"
m_ex_trina_02_18,"how about stopping by, Sun?"
m_ex_trina_02_19,I think the little ones miss you.
m_ex_trina_02_20,"Sorry, but I have an important meeting in the afternoon :("
m_ex_trina_02_21,"Oh,"
m_ex_trina_02_22,I see.
m_ex_trina_02_23,That's too bad :'(
m_ex_trina_02_24,Maybe next time.
m_ex_trina_02_25,Of course.
m_ex_trina_02_26,That would be nice.
m_ex_trina_02_27,Hehe.
m_ex_trina_02_28,By the way...
m_ex_trina_02_29,"Considering that we're inside the Ark,"
m_ex_trina_02_30,it's surprisingly lush and verdant here.
m_ex_trina_02_31,It feels like I could almost
m_ex_trina_02_32,become one with the greenery.
m_ex_trina_02_33,Huh? What do you mean?
m_ex_trina_02_34,Hehe.
m_ex_trina_02_35,Hehehe.
m_ex_trina_02_36,Just a moment.
m_ex_trina_02_37,Trina?
m_ex_trina_02_38,Trina doesn't reply.
m_ex_trina_02_39,She surely can't be doing what I think she is... right?
m_ex_trina_02_40,Phew...
m_ex_trina_02_41,That feels much better.
m_ex_trina_02_42,What did you do?
m_ex_trina_02_43,"With one less layer, I've gotten one step closer to nature, hehe."
m_ex_trina_02_44,Now I'm thinking about taking a nap here.
m_ex_trina_02_45,"With the way you're right now, you should sleep indoors."
m_ex_trina_02_46,"I don't know,"
m_ex_trina_02_47,lying down on the grass like this is so comfortable.
m_ex_trina_02_48,I'm already feeling a bit drowsy.
m_ex_trina_02_49,"Hold on, I'll be there soon."
m_ex_trina_02_50,"Oh my, really?"
m_ex_trina_02_51,All rght.
m_ex_trina_02_52,"The little ones and I will be haer, reesting."
m_ex_trina_02_53,Teak your time.
m_ex_trina_02_54,All right.
m_ex_trina_02_55,"If those typos are any indication, I'd say Trina must have dozed off by now."
m_ex_trina_02_56,I need to hurry over there
m_ex_trina_02_57,and cover her with something before someone sees her.
m_ex_trina_03_1,Hmm...
m_ex_trina_03_2,I've been feeling a bit sluggish lately.
m_ex_trina_03_3,:(
m_ex_trina_03_4,Is something wrong?
m_ex_trina_03_5,Not really.
m_ex_trina_03_6,I've just felt
m_ex_trina_03_7,super lethargic.
m_ex_trina_03_8,Same goes for the little ones above my head.
m_ex_trina_03_9,All they've done lately is sleep.
m_ex_trina_03_10,"Anyway, how are you doing, Sun?"
m_ex_trina_03_11,I've been pretty busy for the past few days.
m_ex_trina_03_12,Hm.
m_ex_trina_03_13,I see.
m_ex_trina_03_14,I was thinking of
m_ex_trina_03_15,"heading to the Commander's Room to cheer myself up,"
m_ex_trina_03_16,but I guess now's not a good time.
m_ex_trina_03_17,"No, you can come over."
m_ex_trina_03_18,Really?
m_ex_trina_03_19,You seem to have a lot on your plate.
m_ex_trina_03_20,You don't have to
m_ex_trina_03_21,stretch yourself thin on my account.
m_ex_trina_03_22,It's fine. I should be finished with everything by tomorrow.
m_ex_trina_03_23,So you'll be free then?
m_ex_trina_03_24,"I believe so, yes."
m_ex_trina_03_25,All right!
m_ex_trina_03_26,"Thank you so much, Sun!"
m_ex_trina_03_27,"Seeing you will put a pep in the little ones' step as well, I'm sure!"
m_ex_trina_03_28,"Haha, glad to hear that."
m_ex_trina_03_29,I'll let them know about our plans!
m_ex_trina_03_30,Sounds good.
m_ex_trina_03_31,I should
m_ex_trina_03_32,buy some snacks too for tomorrow.
m_ex_trina_03_33,"Sure, sure."
m_ex_trina_03_34,I will
m_ex_trina_03_35,leave my clothes
m_ex_trina_03_36,in the arboretum as well.
m_ex_trina_03_37,Come again?
m_ex_trina_03_38,Hmm?
m_ex_trina_03_39,I want to take you in as much as possible.
m_ex_trina_03_40,"In order to do that, I shouldn't cover up my body."
m_ex_trina_03_41,Don't you think you should cover up just a little?
m_ex_trina_03_42,"Hehe, fine."
m_ex_trina_03_43,"If you insist, I'll consider it."
m_ex_trina_03_44,I'd appreciate it.
m_ex_trina_03_45,Hehe.
m_ex_trina_03_46,Just let me know when you're ready.
m_ex_trina_03_47,I'll be waiting to hear from you!
m_ex_trina_03_48,Okay.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_1,"Flora,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_2,are you there?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_3,Flora?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_4,I'm here. What is it?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_5,I think she's sleeping...
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_6,Flora?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_7,How come you're using Sun's phone?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_8,"Trina,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_9,don't be alarmed.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_10,I believe Blossom is pulling your leg.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_11,"Oh,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_12,I see!
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_13,"Ha, he really got me!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_14,"Hmm, I see."
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_15,"No worries, I'll just try again later."
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_16,"Don't worry, I'm here.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_17,"Sorry,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_18,I ended up conversing with the little ones longer than expected.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_19,"Anyway, what did you need me for?"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_20,Uh...
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_21,I have a question.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_22,Oh?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_23,What is it?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_24,"Whatever it is, I'll try to answer it to the best of my knowledge.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_25,"I've been wanting to know,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_26,what kind of flower
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_27,do I smell like?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_28,I've been wondering that myself.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_29,I see.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_30,"Well, if that's your question, I can answer you straight away.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_31,"Oh, wow!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_32,So what kind of flower
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_33,do I smell like?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_34,"Trina,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_35,you always smell heavily of moss.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_36,...
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_37,...
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_38,"Well, moss isn't so bad, I guess."
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_39,"Not only is moss cute,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_40,but its meaning matches Trina perfectly.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_41,What does moss symbolize?
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_42,Motherly love.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_43,"Considering how much Trina cherishes her little ones,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_44,doesn't it suit her perfectly?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_45,"Oh, I see it now!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_46,"Hehe,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_47,that's great.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_48,I should let the little ones know about this.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_49,That really does fit her to a T.
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_50,I'm glad that you both approve.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_51,"Trina,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_52,"if you ever have any questions for me,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_53,don't hesitate to ask.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_54,"Will do, hehe!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_55,"Well then,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_01_56,I'll get going.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_1,Flora!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_2,Sun!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_3,Are either of you busy right now?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_4,"No, why?"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_5,I'm free too.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_6,What's up?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_7,Uh...
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_8,One of the little ones I've been raising on my head
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_9,has gone missing!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_10,Did you look for them?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_11,Of course.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_12,"I searched the entire arboretum,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_13,but I just couldn't find them anywhere :'(
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_14,Which of the four is it?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_15,Hm...
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_16,"The small,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_17,cute one
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_18,with the white feathers.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_19,???
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_20,Does it have a bad case of RBF
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_21,and always look a little mad?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_22,Yes! That one!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_23,How in the world did you figure that out with so little information?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_24,"I've spent my fair share of time with them too,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_25,so I've developed a real understanding of them.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_26,Impressive.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_27,"Anyway, I'll go looking for them straight away.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_28,Please wait for my update.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_29,"All right,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_30,thank you!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_31,Is there any particular reason why I'm being included in this?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_32,"Before my little birdie disappeared,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_33,the last place I visited was the Commander's Room and the garden.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_34,"Okay, I understand."
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_35,"I just checked the garden,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_36,but didn't see anything.✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_37,I see...
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_38,"Blossom,"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_39,could you spare a moment to help Trina?✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_40,"Please, Sun!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_41,I need your help!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_42,This room is so small. I don't see where it could possibly hide.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_43,I look around my room for a moment.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_44,...?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_45,A white feather is sticking out of the cup that's placed on my desk.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_46,I'm pretty sure I found its hiding spot.
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_47,Really?!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_48,What a relief!
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_49,I'm so glad to hear you found it!✿
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_50,I'll keep them here with me. Do you want to come get it?
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_51,"Yes, I'll come right away!"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_52,"I haven't got much going on, so I'll tag along.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_53,"Wait just a moment for us, Blossom.✿"
m_ex_botanikgarden_02_54,"Sure, take your time."
m_ex_newflavor_01_1,Rapi has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_2,Rapi has invited Bready to join the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_3,Rapi has invited Crust to join the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_4,"Sorry to invite you like this so suddenly, Commander,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_5,but we require assistance from Bready and Crust.
m_ex_newflavor_01_6,You need our help?
m_ex_newflavor_01_7,What is it?
m_ex_newflavor_01_8,"I've been going around the Outpost explaining the situation to the Nikkes,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_9,"but some of them either don't understand, or want to know more about what's going on."
m_ex_newflavor_01_10,"I'm unsure as to how much I should tell them, or how to go about it."
m_ex_newflavor_01_11,Could you help?
m_ex_newflavor_01_12,"Ah, so that's it!"
m_ex_newflavor_01_13,"I'm a little busy right now,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_14,but I can certainly help you out.
m_ex_newflavor_01_15,Thank you.
m_ex_newflavor_01_16,I'll invite them into the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_17,Rapi has invited Sugar to join the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_18,Rapi has invited Laplace to join the group.
m_ex_newflavor_01_19,"Wait, you were talking about these two?"
m_ex_newflavor_01_20,"Thanks for the invite,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_21,Rapi.
m_ex_newflavor_01_22,Hey!
m_ex_newflavor_01_23,Did someone call for a hero?!
m_ex_newflavor_01_24,Uh...
m_ex_newflavor_01_25,Hello there.
m_ex_newflavor_01_26,I heard that you required an explanation for what's going on. Is that correct?
m_ex_newflavor_01_27,Yeah.
m_ex_newflavor_01_28,What's all this about how we should stop selling our coffee?
m_ex_newflavor_01_29,What's the big idea about saying our coffee tastes bad?!
m_ex_newflavor_01_30,This is all completely unprovoked! It doesn't make any sense.
m_ex_newflavor_01_31,There's clearly some kind of plot meant to undermine our cafe!
m_ex_newflavor_01_32,"Oh, hehe... that's not what's happening."
m_ex_newflavor_01_33,"Perhaps the fault lies with the Splendamin,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_34,but much of the food being recently made in this area tastes quite strange.
m_ex_newflavor_01_35,"Your coffee, I'm afraid, is no exception."
m_ex_newflavor_01_36,"Therefore, I think it would be best not to sell it for a while."
m_ex_newflavor_01_37,All the food tastes weird?
m_ex_newflavor_01_38,So it's not just our coffee?
m_ex_newflavor_01_39,Correct.
m_ex_newflavor_01_40,"Sugar, where are you, exactly?"
m_ex_newflavor_01_41,"Have no fear, the Hero is here to help you save your beloved flavor!"
m_ex_newflavor_01_42,No kidding...
m_ex_newflavor_01_43,Then Black Typhoon's fuel might be compromised too.
m_ex_newflavor_01_44,I better go check.
m_ex_newflavor_01_45,See you guys later.
m_ex_newflavor_01_46,Sugar left the group chat.
m_ex_newflavor_01_47,Huh?
m_ex_newflavor_01_48,This is a catastrophe!
m_ex_newflavor_01_49,Black Typhoon's fuel going bad?!
m_ex_newflavor_01_50,This calls for some heroic intervention!
m_ex_newflavor_01_51,"Hero, away!"
m_ex_newflavor_01_52,alqk2
m_ex_newflavor_01_53,"Whoops, wrong button."
m_ex_newflavor_01_54,Laplace left the group chat.
m_ex_newflavor_01_55,...
m_ex_newflavor_01_56,What was that?
m_ex_newflavor_01_57,"Rapi, care to explain?"
m_ex_newflavor_01_58,I'm sorry.
m_ex_newflavor_01_59,It's impossible to control those two.
m_ex_newflavor_01_60,Apologies for disturbing you.
m_ex_newflavor_01_61,"It's all right, you're clearly working hard too..."
m_ex_newflavor_01_62,"At any rate,"
m_ex_newflavor_01_63,"I'll keep this chat group around, just in case."
m_ex_newflavor_01_64,I'll get back to patrolling the Outpost again.
m_ex_newflavor_01_65,"Thanks, Rapi."
m_ex_newflavor_01_66,Good luck out there!
m_ex_newflavor_01_67,"You too, Crust."
m_ex_newflavor_02_1,Allow me to make a quick report.
m_ex_newflavor_02_2,Everyone in the Outpost has been informed of the situation.
m_ex_newflavor_02_3,"Just as before, some of those who couldn't understand,"
m_ex_newflavor_02_4,"such as Jackal and Drake, threw a fit."
m_ex_newflavor_02_5,"I felt it would be unwise to invite them into this group,"
m_ex_newflavor_02_6,"so I handled the situation myself and tried my best to explain, which placated them for now."
m_ex_newflavor_02_7,Thank you for helping.
m_ex_newflavor_02_8,That's something we should have done ourselves.
m_ex_newflavor_02_9,"Nicely done, Rapi."
m_ex_newflavor_02_10,No worries.
m_ex_newflavor_02_11,Any progress on finding a Splendamin replacement?
m_ex_newflavor_02_12,No...
m_ex_newflavor_02_13,It's proving to be as difficult as we expected.
m_ex_newflavor_02_14,Makes sense.
m_ex_newflavor_02_15,"If a replacement could be found so easily,"
m_ex_newflavor_02_16,Splendamin would have gone by the wayside long ago.
m_ex_newflavor_02_17,There are so many conditions that need to be met.
m_ex_newflavor_02_18,It'll be some time before we find something that fulfills all those requirements.
m_ex_newflavor_02_19,Doesn't sound easy.
m_ex_newflavor_02_20,"Still, we have to keep going."
m_ex_newflavor_02_21,I'm rooting for you.
m_ex_newflavor_02_22,Have you run into any dangerous situations out there?
m_ex_newflavor_02_23,Not really.
m_ex_newflavor_02_24,That's a relief.
m_ex_newflavor_02_25,"Oh, wait! There was one."
m_ex_newflavor_02_26,Oh? What is it?
m_ex_newflavor_02_27,Huh?
m_ex_newflavor_02_28,"What are you talking about, Mr. Gourmand? We haven't run into any danger."
m_ex_newflavor_02_29,"Yeah, that's right."
m_ex_newflavor_02_30,The meals Crust packed are so delicious that I might get addicted.
m_ex_newflavor_02_31,Wow!
m_ex_newflavor_02_32,...
m_ex_newflavor_02_33,Commander.
m_ex_newflavor_02_34,For goodness sake.
m_ex_newflavor_02_35,You're up on the surface right now.
m_ex_newflavor_02_36,It's a place where anything could happen.
m_ex_newflavor_02_37,"Please be more careful with your words,"
m_ex_newflavor_02_38,in order to avoid any misunderstandings.
m_ex_newflavor_02_39,... Sorry about that.
m_ex_newflavor_02_40,"Don't worry, Rapi."
m_ex_newflavor_02_41,We'll be protecting the Commander
m_ex_newflavor_02_42,and ensuring nothing happens to him.
m_ex_newflavor_02_43,We're also making sure all his meals are taken care of.
m_ex_newflavor_02_44,They really are mouthwateringly delicious.
m_ex_newflavor_02_45,Very good. Thank you.
m_ex_newflavor_02_46,Take care of him and get him back safe.
m_ex_newflavor_02_47,We certainly will.
m_ex_newflavor_03_1,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_newflavor_03_2,Are you seeing the messages I'm sending here?
m_ex_newflavor_03_3,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_newflavor_03_4,Bonne Bouche. Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_newflavor_03_5,??
m_ex_newflavor_03_6,Who is Bonne Bouche?
m_ex_newflavor_03_7,"Oh right, I forgot you were in this group as well, Rapi."
m_ex_newflavor_03_8,Have you seen Bonne Bouche by any chance?
m_ex_newflavor_03_9,Are you in contact with him?
m_ex_newflavor_03_10,I repeat:
m_ex_newflavor_03_11,Who is Bonne Bouche?
m_ex_newflavor_03_12,Ah...
m_ex_newflavor_03_13,Bonne Bouche is Mr. Gourmand.
m_ex_newflavor_03_14,Do you mean the Commander?
m_ex_newflavor_03_15,"Why are you calling him ""Bonne Bouche""?"
m_ex_newflavor_03_16,Because he's delicious.
m_ex_newflavor_03_17,"He has a magnificent taste,"
m_ex_newflavor_03_18,so that's why I call him Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_newflavor_03_19,???
m_ex_newflavor_03_20,So this nickname has to do with how the Commander tastes?
m_ex_newflavor_03_21,...
m_ex_newflavor_03_22,Does that mean you've tasted the Commander?
m_ex_newflavor_03_23,Er...
m_ex_newflavor_03_24,Well...
m_ex_newflavor_03_25,"Maybe once or twice, hehe."
m_ex_newflavor_03_26,"So, have you seen him anywhere?"
m_ex_newflavor_03_27,"Right now, Mr. Gourmand is the only one who can stop Bready."
m_ex_newflavor_03_28,I haven't been in contact with the Commander today.
m_ex_newflavor_03_29,I don't know where he is either.
m_ex_newflavor_03_30,I see.
m_ex_newflavor_03_31,Bready. I think Mr. Gourmand is busy.
m_ex_newflavor_03_32,Let's try contacting him later.
m_ex_newflavor_03_33,...
m_ex_newflavor_03_34,Oh well...
m_ex_newflavor_03_35,Fine.
m_ex_newflavor_03_36,"Thanks for your help, Rapi."
m_ex_newflavor_03_37,Sure.
m_ex_newflavor_03_38,Hmm...
m_ex_newflavor_03_39,"I was thinking of getting rid of this chat group,"
m_ex_newflavor_03_40,but perhaps I should leave it for a little longer.
m_ex_newflavor_03_41,"Whenever you have time, please contact us, Commander."
m_ex_newflavor_03_42,I'll be waiting.
m_ex_newflavor_03_43,... I should probably contact Rapi one on one later.
m_ex_newflavor_04_1,Bready.
m_ex_newflavor_04_2,Crust.
m_ex_newflavor_04_3,Have either of you been in touch with the Commander?
m_ex_newflavor_04_4,Let me think...
m_ex_newflavor_04_5,Uhh...
m_ex_newflavor_04_6,Mr. Gourmand is probably with Bready.
m_ex_newflavor_04_7,Is something wrong?
m_ex_newflavor_04_8,Bready has been visiting him
m_ex_newflavor_04_9,quite often lately.
m_ex_newflavor_04_10,Well...
m_ex_newflavor_04_11,"From what I know,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_12,she's been meeting up with him
m_ex_newflavor_04_13,as often as she has
m_ex_newflavor_04_14,because she and him need to discuss flavors.
m_ex_newflavor_04_15,Bready is an expert
m_ex_newflavor_04_16,when it comes to flavors.
m_ex_newflavor_04_17,Why would she have to go to the Commander?
m_ex_newflavor_04_18,Er...
m_ex_newflavor_04_19,Well...
m_ex_newflavor_04_20,"Because I have a rather peculiar palate, hehe."
m_ex_newflavor_04_21,"There you are, Mr. Gourmand!"
m_ex_newflavor_04_22,"Yes, your tastes are rather unique, and you have a distinctive way of describing food."
m_ex_newflavor_04_23,That's why I call you Mr. Gourmand!
m_ex_newflavor_04_24,...
m_ex_newflavor_04_25,"You've been a great help,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_26,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_newflavor_04_27,I'm eternally grateful to you.
m_ex_newflavor_04_28,Glad to help.
m_ex_newflavor_04_29,...
m_ex_newflavor_04_30,I of course was aware that
m_ex_newflavor_04_31,"the Commander is a man of many talents,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_32,but I had no idea his sense of taste was exceptional too.
m_ex_newflavor_04_33,Hehe...
m_ex_newflavor_04_34,Are you and Bready finished with your discussion?
m_ex_newflavor_04_35,"Yeah, we just finished."
m_ex_newflavor_04_36,Okay.
m_ex_newflavor_04_37,"Now that all of our work is complete, I don't think we'll be needing this chat group anymore."
m_ex_newflavor_04_38,I'll head out.
m_ex_newflavor_04_39,"Oh, Commander."
m_ex_newflavor_04_40,"I have a brief report I'd like to share with you, so I'll come pay you a visit."
m_ex_newflavor_04_41,Okay.
m_ex_newflavor_04_42,Rapi left the group chat.
m_ex_newflavor_04_43,"All right then,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_44,I suppose I'll leave too.
m_ex_newflavor_04_45,Crust left the group chat.
m_ex_newflavor_04_46,"Should we leave the group as well, Bready?"
m_ex_newflavor_04_47,Yeah.
m_ex_newflavor_04_48,"But before that,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_49,"I wanted to say how delicious you were today, Bonne Bouche."
m_ex_newflavor_04_50,It was such a beautiful and enchanting experience.
m_ex_newflavor_04_51,See you around.
m_ex_newflavor_04_52,See you.
m_ex_newflavor_04_53,Bready left the group chat.
m_ex_newflavor_04_54,"Considering I'm the only one left,"
m_ex_newflavor_04_55,I might as well keep this chat group around for posterity.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_1,Bready has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_2,"Hello,"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_3,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_4,Bready?
m_ex_trueflavor_01_5,"There's a question I've been meaning to ask you,"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_6,so I made a separate chat group.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_7,I see.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_8,What should I do if she asks about the research...?
m_ex_trueflavor_01_9,I'm pretty sure I saw someone
m_ex_trueflavor_01_10,wearing a school uniform head into the kitchen earlier.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_11,Could that have been an M.M.R. Vocational School student
m_ex_trueflavor_01_12,who attended one of Crust's special classes before?
m_ex_trueflavor_01_13,"Ah yes, you're right."
m_ex_trueflavor_01_14,...
m_ex_trueflavor_01_15,"Crust isn't up to any dangerous research, is she?"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_16,"I seriously doubt she would,"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_17,but she certainly seems more determined than usual.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_18,It's also the first time
m_ex_trueflavor_01_19,"she's invited an outsider into the kitchen during the research phase,"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_20,so I was worried.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_21,You don't need to be worried.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_22,Really?
m_ex_trueflavor_01_23,"Okay, I trust you."
m_ex_trueflavor_01_24,This whole situation must be frustrating for you.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_25,"Oh, well... hehe."
m_ex_trueflavor_01_26,I'll just have to trust in Crust and wait.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_27,"And besides, you're there with her,"
m_ex_trueflavor_01_28,so I know she'll be all right.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_29,That's right. I'll take care of her.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_30,I trust you.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_31,Let me know if there are any problems.
m_ex_trueflavor_01_32,Bye.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_1,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_2,Bonne Bouche!
m_ex_trueflavor_02_3,Yes?
m_ex_trueflavor_02_4,It seems Crust is finished with her research.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_5,"It would appear so, yeah."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_6,I received an invitation.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_7,This is the first time she's done something like that.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_8,What kind of research was she doing which warrants all this pomp and circumstance?
m_ex_trueflavor_02_9,Ah.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_10,"Don't worry,"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_11,that was a rhetorical question.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_12,I want to hear the answer from Crust herself.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_13,"Ha, understandable."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_14,So...
m_ex_trueflavor_02_15,"How does everything look to you, Bonne Bouche?"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_16,What do you mean?
m_ex_trueflavor_02_17,I mean about Crust.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_18,You saw the whole research process up close.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_19,How did she look to you?
m_ex_trueflavor_02_20,"I didn't get to see her at all, so I'm curious."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_21,She looked tired.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_22,She looked happy.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_23,Hmm...
m_ex_trueflavor_02_24,I see.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_25,That must have been hard for you to see.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_26,I myself find it hard at times watching her work as hard as she does.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_27,"Running around doing everything,"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_28,all by herself.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_29,It's doubly hard since I know there's nothing I can do to help.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_30,"Oh,"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_31,well that's a small relief at least.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_32,"Whenever I tasted the food she's been making,"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_33,"it seemed like things weren't going well, and I thought maybe she was having a hard time."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_34,"But if she was happy during the process, then there's nothing to be worried about."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_35,"Anyway,"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_36,I'm really looking forward to this.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_37,"You'll be there too, won't you?"
m_ex_trueflavor_02_38,"Yeah, I'll be there."
m_ex_trueflavor_02_39,Okay.
m_ex_trueflavor_02_40,See you tomorrow then!
m_ex_trueflavor_02_41,Bye.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_1,Bonne Bouche!
m_ex_trueflavor_03_2,Where did you go?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_3,We've come up with a great solution.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_4,Bready has invited Crust to join the group.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_5,Bready has invited Ade to join the group.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_6,Bready has invited Tia to join the group.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_7,"We can talk here, everyone."
m_ex_trueflavor_03_8,"Hey, Mr. Gourmand! Fancy seeing you here."
m_ex_trueflavor_03_9,"Hi, Master :)"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_10,"Hello, Teacher!"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_11,Did you all have something to tell me?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_12,We've all been thinking:
m_ex_trueflavor_03_13,What if you try to cook an entire meal
m_ex_trueflavor_03_14,from start to finish?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_15,Huh?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_16,I heard that any food which you touch
m_ex_trueflavor_03_17,ends up tasting rather unique.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_18,That got us thinking.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_19,"If your hands are indeed enchanted,"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_20,what if you cooked an entire meal with those magic hands of yours?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_21,Surely that would be a big help for Miss Crust.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_22,Why are you two getting involved in this all of a sudden?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_23,Isn't it obvious?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_24,"Because it sounds like fun, haha!"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_25,"And while I might not be able to personally taste what you make,"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_26,"I'm still curious about this so-called ""unique flavor"" of yours."
m_ex_trueflavor_03_27,Watching Crust's research up close
m_ex_trueflavor_03_28,could also help us come up with ways
m_ex_trueflavor_03_29,to improve the menu at the cafe.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_30,... Uh-huh.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_31,So where are you right now?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_32,We prepared all the ingredients and the recipe.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_33,All we need is for you to come over!
m_ex_trueflavor_03_34,"I'm so excited, hehe!"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_35,Come on over to the kitchen.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_36,"Oh, sorry, but I'm a little busy right now."
m_ex_trueflavor_03_37,"Oh no, you are?"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_38,Really?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_39,"Darn, you're busy?"
m_ex_trueflavor_03_40,We already prepared everything. What should we do?
m_ex_trueflavor_03_41,...
m_ex_trueflavor_03_42,I'll be right over. We'll have to make this quick.
m_ex_trueflavor_03_43,Whoohoo! Of course!
m_ex_trueflavor_03_44,Be careful on your way here. We'll be waiting!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_1,Ade!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_2,"The Maid Cafe is opening today, right?"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_3,That's right :)
m_ex_trueflavor_04_4,Yay!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_5,"How much longer until school ends,"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_6,Tia?
m_ex_trueflavor_04_7,"Just one more class, hehe!"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_8,Very nice!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_9,"Where are you, Bready?"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_10,I'm already at the Maid Cafe.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_11,"Wow, that was quick."
m_ex_trueflavor_04_12,"Are you ready, Mr. Gourmand?"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_13,Huh? Where are we going? What's happening?
m_ex_trueflavor_04_14,???
m_ex_trueflavor_04_15,Did nobody contact you?
m_ex_trueflavor_04_16,We all decided to meet up at the Maid Cafe today.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_17,We're going to sample the new dessert
m_ex_trueflavor_04_18,that Crust and Ade made
m_ex_trueflavor_04_19,before they officially launch it.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_20,... And I was a part of this?
m_ex_trueflavor_04_21,"Yes, you were!"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_22,I'm so exciteddddd!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_23,It's gonna be so delicious!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_24,"Remember to be there on time, everyone,"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_25,and be sure to arrive on an empty stomach.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_26,Since when did you four become so close?
m_ex_trueflavor_04_27,Anyone who cooks with their heart is bound to get along.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_28,I agree :)
m_ex_trueflavor_04_29,Those who are in pursuit of new flavors also get along well.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_30,And anyone who enjoys sweets
m_ex_trueflavor_04_31,"can't be all that bad, hehe."
m_ex_trueflavor_04_32,"Ha, well, it's nice to see you all getting along."
m_ex_trueflavor_04_33,"I'll send messages in here,"
m_ex_trueflavor_04_34,and we can all meet up for a meal from time to time.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_35,Sounds good.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_36,Oh boy.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_37,My class is starting.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_38,I'll message you guys when it's finished.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_39,Okay.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_40,Study hard!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_41,You bet!
m_ex_trueflavor_04_42,"In the meantime, let's all take a moment to relax."
m_ex_trueflavor_04_43,We'll regroup once Tia contacts us.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_44,Okay.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_45,See you all later.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_46,Looks like I've found some fellow foodies.
m_ex_trueflavor_04_47,Even if it's awfully dessert-centric...
m_ex_trueflavor_04_48,"In the meantime, I'll eagerly wait for Tia's class to end."
m_ex_bready_01_1,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_bready_01_2,Hello.
m_ex_bready_01_3,Apparently we're going to be working together.
m_ex_bready_01_4,"Yes, so I hear."
m_ex_bready_01_5,Good.
m_ex_bready_01_6,Now I don't have to worry about following you around
m_ex_bready_01_7,and taking time out of our busy schedule
m_ex_bready_01_8,to make plans with you.
m_ex_bready_01_9,I don't think either of those things ever concerned you before.
m_ex_bready_01_10,"Hehe, well, to be honest,"
m_ex_bready_01_11,I was worried about what Crust would think.
m_ex_bready_01_12,"I usually can't leave my post when I'm needed,"
m_ex_bready_01_13,"but now that I'm working with you,"
m_ex_bready_01_14,I've got the perfect excuse!
m_ex_bready_01_15,You consider us working together an excuse?
m_ex_bready_01_16,Hmm.
m_ex_bready_01_17,"I desperately want to taste you again, Bonne Bouche."
m_ex_bready_01_18,"In fact,"
m_ex_bready_01_19,I'm a bit hungry at the moment.
m_ex_bready_01_20,"Where are you, hehe?"
m_ex_bready_01_21,Not now.
m_ex_bready_01_22,Why not?
m_ex_bready_01_23,Are you busy?
m_ex_bready_01_24,I want to lick your hand.
m_ex_bready_01_25,Can't I?
m_ex_bready_01_26,You did precisely that for two days straight.
m_ex_bready_01_27,That's right.
m_ex_bready_01_28,"If I lick your hands today, that'll make it three."
m_ex_bready_01_29,Good.
m_ex_bready_01_30,My hands need some rest.
m_ex_bready_01_31,Aren't they resting right now?
m_ex_bready_01_32,It's not like I'm licking them all day.
m_ex_bready_01_33,"Of course, I'd love nothing more than that,"
m_ex_bready_01_34,but I feel like my stomach might burst if I did.
m_ex_bready_01_35,Don't you have any consideration for my hands in all this?
m_ex_bready_01_36,"Your hands are so precious to me, Bonne Bouche."
m_ex_bready_01_37,I'm always worried about what I'll do
m_ex_bready_01_38,if the taste suddenly changes.
m_ex_bready_01_39,"What if, one day, your hands taste entirely different?"
m_ex_bready_01_40,...
m_ex_bready_01_41,"Actually, that could be kinda fun."
m_ex_bready_01_42,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_bready_01_43,So is today really a no go?
m_ex_bready_01_44,"Fine, sounds like I don't have much of a choice. You can go ahead."
m_ex_bready_01_45,Woohoo!
m_ex_bready_01_46,I'll leave right away.
m_ex_bready_01_47,Wait for me just a few minutes.
m_ex_bready_02_1,Bonne Bouche.
m_ex_bready_02_2,Are you busy?
m_ex_bready_02_3,"No, what's up?"
m_ex_bready_02_4,"I went to the surface today,"
m_ex_bready_02_5,and I found a leg that belonged to a Nikke.
m_ex_bready_02_6,!!
m_ex_bready_02_7,"Crust and I got to talking,"
m_ex_bready_02_8,"and we started wondering who it was,"
m_ex_bready_02_9,and how this had happened.
m_ex_bready_02_10,I thought it might be better knowing who she was when sending her off
m_ex_bready_02_11,so I tasted her.
m_ex_bready_02_12,Okay.
m_ex_bready_02_13,However...
m_ex_bready_02_14,"I don't know exactly what happened, but"
m_ex_bready_02_15,the only sensation that stood out
m_ex_bready_02_16,was that of liberation.
m_ex_bready_02_17,I've experienced all manner of different tastes in my life.
m_ex_bready_02_18,I've even tasted other Nikkes before.
m_ex_bready_02_19,But this was the most bitter taste I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.
m_ex_bready_02_20,"For the rest of the day, I've felt this sense of suffocation and indigestion."
m_ex_bready_02_21,It's awful.
m_ex_bready_02_22,"That's unfortunate, but what can you do?"
m_ex_bready_02_23,I suppose this is what it feels like to be
m_ex_bready_02_24,so attuned to the emotional state of others.
m_ex_bready_02_25,Do you want to come to my room?
m_ex_bready_02_26,Where are you? I'll meet you.
m_ex_bready_02_27,...
m_ex_bready_02_28,You're right.
m_ex_bready_02_29,"If I'm with you,"
m_ex_bready_02_30,I think I'll feel better.
m_ex_bready_02_31,Do you want to come to the kitchen?
m_ex_bready_02_32,"Crust said that nothing beats eating sweets when you're feeling down,"
m_ex_bready_02_33,so she's making a dessert right now.
m_ex_bready_02_34,You and I can share it.
m_ex_bready_02_35,I'd like that.
m_ex_bready_02_36,All right.
m_ex_bready_02_37,See you soon.
m_ex_bready_02_38,And thank you for listening.
m_ex_bready_02_39,I know it's a heavy topic.
m_ex_bready_02_40,"You can talk to me about anything, anytime."
m_ex_bready_02_41,"Hehe, all right."
m_ex_bready_02_42,I feel so much better already!
m_ex_bready_02_43,"Hurry on over, Bonne Bouche."
m_ex_bready_02_44,I'll be there soon.
m_ex_bready_03_1,"Bonne Bouche,"
m_ex_bready_03_2,are you a regular at the Maid Cafe?
m_ex_bready_03_3,I don't think I would consider myself a regular...
m_ex_bready_03_4,"Yes, I go there every day."
m_ex_bready_03_5,Is that so?
m_ex_bready_03_6,You looked like one to me.
m_ex_bready_03_7,Every day?
m_ex_bready_03_8,"Why is it then that whenever I ask what you're up to,"
m_ex_bready_03_9,you say you're busy?
m_ex_bready_03_10,"Anyways,"
m_ex_bready_03_11,"when the maids there drizzle the ketchup,"
m_ex_bready_03_12,did you know
m_ex_bready_03_13,that the taste differs depending on
m_ex_bready_03_14,who's doing it?
m_ex_bready_03_15,Really? Even if it's the same ketchup?
m_ex_bready_03_16,Yes.
m_ex_bready_03_17,The taste changes based on the emotions behind it.
m_ex_bready_03_18,"How is it different, exactly?"
m_ex_bready_03_19,Think about all the maids who drizzle the ketchup:
m_ex_bready_03_20,"Cocoa, Ade, Soda."
m_ex_bready_03_21,"Imagine what kind of emotions they're feeling whilst drizzling the ketchup,"
m_ex_bready_03_22,and you'll know.
m_ex_bready_03_23,For Cocoa... tanginess.
m_ex_bready_03_24,For Cocoa... sweetness.
m_ex_bready_03_25,That's correct.
m_ex_bready_03_26,Cocoa's ketchup has a bright and tangy flavor.
m_ex_bready_03_27,One bite is enough to make you feel refreshed.
m_ex_bready_03_28,"You're quite something, Bonne Bouche!"
m_ex_bready_03_29,Not quite.
m_ex_bready_03_30,I'd say it's more of a bright and tangy flavor.
m_ex_bready_03_31,One bite is enough to make you feel refreshed.
m_ex_bready_03_32,"Sorry, Bonne Bouche, but your flavor deduction skills aren't quite there yet."
m_ex_bready_03_33,Next up we have Ade.
m_ex_bready_03_34,What do you think her ketchup tastes like?
m_ex_bready_03_35,A classic ketchup taste.
m_ex_bready_03_36,Gentle and soothing.
m_ex_bready_03_37,Correct.
m_ex_bready_03_38,Ade's ketchup is remarkable in a different way.
m_ex_bready_03_39,"No one single flavor profile sticks out,"
m_ex_bready_03_40,but that's only because it's perfectly balanced.
m_ex_bready_03_41,Hmm...
m_ex_bready_03_42,"Ade herself creates an environment that is gentle and soothing,"
m_ex_bready_03_43,"but as for the taste she creates, that's a little different."
m_ex_bready_03_44,Ade's ketchup boasts the classic taste
m_ex_bready_03_45,that everyone associates with it.
m_ex_bready_03_46,"It's clean, crisp, and perfectly balanced."
m_ex_bready_03_47,So I'd say you're only half right.
m_ex_bready_03_48,"Lastly, we have Soda."
m_ex_bready_03_49,What do you think?
m_ex_bready_03_50,Sweet.
m_ex_bready_03_51,A bit of a jumbled mess.
m_ex_bready_03_52,"Hehe, you're right."
m_ex_bready_03_53,The sweet taste you get as a result of Soda's affection is second to none.
m_ex_bready_03_54,It really puts a smile on your face.
m_ex_bready_03_55,What?
m_ex_bready_03_56,"I know Soda tends to cause a lot of trouble,"
m_ex_bready_03_57,"but when she's cooking, she's more professional than anyone."
m_ex_bready_03_58,She imbues her food with a sweet and joyful taste.
m_ex_bready_03_59,"So,"
m_ex_bready_03_60,"as you can see, Bonne Bouche,"
m_ex_bready_03_61,the taste of the ketchup can differ depending on who is pouring it.
m_ex_bready_03_62,"So, next time you order an omurice at the Maid Cafe,"
m_ex_bready_03_63,"try to really savor the ketchup,"
m_ex_bready_03_64,and you'll see that what I'm saying is true.
m_ex_bready_03_65,"Once you're attuned to it, you'll really be able to taste the difference."
m_ex_bready_03_66,I'll do that.
m_ex_bready_03_67,Or maybe...
m_ex_bready_03_68,You could also go with me sometime.
m_ex_bready_03_69,Feel free to get in touch.
m_ex_bready_03_70,"Hehe, all right."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_1,"Mr. Gourmand,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_2,I'm curious...
m_ex_cookingoil_01_3,Do you like Emma's cooking?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_4,Emma's cooking?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_5,Yeah!
m_ex_cookingoil_01_6,What makes you ask?????
m_ex_cookingoil_01_7,Bonne Bouche?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_8,Why are you using so many question marks?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_9,"Oh... I was just caught off guard is all, hehe."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_10,"Oh, okay, hehe."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_11,It's nothing major.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_12,Emma brought a dish over.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_13,She said she made it while watching my program.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_14,"The thing is,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_15,"what I made on the show were egg tarts,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_16,but what she gave me was more like black chunks of coal.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_17,"The most surprising thing though,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_18,"is that she truly did make it with love and dedication,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_19,and she really did follow the show while she made it.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_20,Wow.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_21,"However,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_22,she used twice as many different ingredients as the ones I outlined on the show.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_23,She also added a few extra steps in the cooking process.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_24,Doesn't sound to me like she followed the show...
m_ex_cookingoil_01_25,Cooking isn't an exact science.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_26,"As long as it makes you happy and others find it delicious,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_27,that's all that matters.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_28,I believe that's why Emma continues to make those unique dishes of hers.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_29,Oh?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_30,People enjoy eating Emma's food.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_31,"Since Emma feels that people enjoy her cooking,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_32,she has more motivation to keep striving to improve.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_33,That's the emotion you can taste in her food.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_34,Wow...
m_ex_cookingoil_01_35,"I asked her,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_36,and she said that you also enjoyed it.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_37,Exactly.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_38,"She specifically named you, Bonne Bouche."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_39,"Well, she asked me to try it, and so I had to be nice..."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_40,I knew you were someone who respected all kinds of different foods and tastes.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_41,Hehe.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_42,"At any rate,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_43,we've decided we should support Emma in her cooking ventures.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_44,???
m_ex_cookingoil_01_45,"In this world, no two individuals' taste buds are the same."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_46,Everyone has different preferences.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_47,"I'm sure there will be a demand for Emma's cooking,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_48,"and she'll be able to cook away quite happily, hehe."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_49,"Personally,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_50,I really enjoyed the sense of affection
m_ex_cookingoil_01_51,"conveyed through her cooking,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_52,and plan to eat it from time to time.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_53,Are you serious?
m_ex_cookingoil_01_54,"The flavor is simple, but that's precisely what I enjoy."
m_ex_cookingoil_01_55,And I respect anyone who dedicates themselves to cooking.
m_ex_cookingoil_01_56,"You also enjoy her cooking, Mr. Gourmand,"
m_ex_cookingoil_01_57,so we should all cheer her on together!
m_ex_cookingoil_01_58,Okay...
m_ex_cookingoil_02_1,Mr. Gourmand!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_2,Bready!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_3,I've got a delicious feast ready for you.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_4,Come to the kitchen.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_5,Okay!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_6,Woohoo!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_7,"Also,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_8,today's dessert is
m_ex_cookingoil_02_9,something that Bready invented herself.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_10,"Oh, so you made it personally, Bready?"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_11,No.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_12,"I came up with the original recipe,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_13,but Crust perfected it.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_14,"Ah, I see."
m_ex_cookingoil_02_15,"So you ended up making it, Crust?"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_16,Was the recipe hard to follow?
m_ex_cookingoil_02_17,"It was a bit time-consuming,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_18,but I think it's perfect for a special occasion like today.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_19,What about the taste?
m_ex_cookingoil_02_20,It's perfect.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_21,Good!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_22,"Actually, I've been wondering something for a while."
m_ex_cookingoil_02_23,??
m_ex_cookingoil_02_24,What's that?
m_ex_cookingoil_02_25,"Why don't you do much cooking yourself, Bready?"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_26,Well...
m_ex_cookingoil_02_27,Because I can't guarantee how it'll come out.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_28,Why not?
m_ex_cookingoil_02_29,"When you cook, you have to continually taste it throughout,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_30,"but when I cook,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_31,I end up being overwhelmed with my own emotions and stories from the taste testing.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_32,"In order to avoid that, I cook without tasting what I'm making,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_33,and I end up not being able to tell whether the finished product is any good or not.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_34,I see.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_35,"If Bready were to get in the kitchen,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_36,my job would be at risk!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_37,She knows exactly
m_ex_cookingoil_02_38,what types of ingredients
m_ex_cookingoil_02_39,will bring certain flavors to the forefront.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_40,She's capable of making far more delicious dishes than me.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_41,I'm not so sure about that...
m_ex_cookingoil_02_42,"Even this time, for example. She gave me five variations on the recipe."
m_ex_cookingoil_02_43,"Two of them were already good enough to be put on a restaurant menu,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_44,and the other three only needed minor tweaks to become perfect.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_45,I don't know about that...
m_ex_cookingoil_02_46,I prepared the one I felt was the most delicious of the five.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_47,"I bet you're dying to try it, aren't you, Mr. Gourmand?"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_48,I certainly am!
m_ex_cookingoil_02_49,"Well then,"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_50,get yourself over to the Cooking Oil kitchen
m_ex_cookingoil_02_51,and try the dish that Bready invented.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_52,"I'll be there soon, you don't have to keep saying it!"
m_ex_cookingoil_02_53,"Hehe, Bready, you seem embarrassed."
m_ex_cookingoil_02_54,She gets like this whenever anyone pays her a compliment.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_55,"Anyway, see you soon."
m_ex_cookingoil_02_56,Be there as fast as I can.
m_ex_cookingoil_02_57,See you.
m_ex_crust_01_1,"Mr. Gourmand,"
m_ex_crust_01_2,do you have a minute?
m_ex_crust_01_3,Is something the matter?
m_ex_crust_01_4,"Oh no,"
m_ex_crust_01_5,nothing like that.
m_ex_crust_01_6,It's just that
m_ex_crust_01_7,"since I'm now working with you in an official capacity,"
m_ex_crust_01_8,I wanted to stop by and say hi.
m_ex_crust_01_9,I see.
m_ex_crust_01_10,Hehe.
m_ex_crust_01_11,"So anyway, could I ask you a question?"
m_ex_crust_01_12,How do you usually eat your meals?
m_ex_crust_01_13,I and the rest of the Counters Squad usually eat whatever's at hand.
m_ex_crust_01_14,Ah!
m_ex_crust_01_15,"In that case,"
m_ex_crust_01_16,could I possibly take care of your meals going forward?
m_ex_crust_01_17,"Of course, I could also include the other Counters members,"
m_ex_crust_01_18,"and heck, even the entire Outpost!"
m_ex_crust_01_19,"Okay, but I want the crème de la crème."
m_ex_crust_01_20,"By saying that,"
m_ex_crust_01_21,what do you mean?
m_ex_crust_01_22,I want everything to be a full-course meal.
m_ex_crust_01_23,Hmm...
m_ex_crust_01_24,"That shouldn't be a problem when you're in the Ark,"
m_ex_crust_01_25,but when you're on the surface...
m_ex_crust_01_26,I'm kidding.
m_ex_crust_01_27,"If I really set my mind to it, I could..."
m_ex_crust_01_28,!!
m_ex_crust_01_29,You weren't being serious?
m_ex_crust_01_30,Of course not. But it sounds like it could actually be possible?
m_ex_crust_01_31,Of course!
m_ex_crust_01_32,"Even if it ended up not being possible,"
m_ex_crust_01_33,I'll always try my best.
m_ex_crust_01_34,"Just for you, Mr. Gourmand!"
m_ex_crust_01_35,"Hehe, well you don't have to go that far for me."
m_ex_crust_01_36,"Still,"
m_ex_crust_01_37,I really will do my best.
m_ex_crust_01_38,Nothing can put some pep in your step like good food.
m_ex_crust_01_39,Mmm...
m_ex_crust_01_40,Is something wrong?
m_ex_crust_01_41,"No, I'm just really looking forward to trying your food."
m_ex_crust_01_42,"Hehe, I appreciate you saying that."
m_ex_crust_01_43,I'll come over and pay you a visit soon.
m_ex_crust_01_44,Sounds good. I'll make sure not to eat much beforehand.
m_ex_crust_01_45,You really don't have to do that on my account.
m_ex_crust_02_1,"Mr. Gourmand,"
m_ex_crust_02_2,what's your favorite type of food?
m_ex_crust_02_3,"Fatty foods, even though they're not good for you."
m_ex_crust_02_4,Light and healthy foods.
m_ex_crust_02_5,Fatty foods?
m_ex_crust_02_6,You mean like heavy meats and deep-fried things?
m_ex_crust_02_7,Yeah. They're absolutely delicious.
m_ex_crust_02_8,Healthy foods?
m_ex_crust_02_9,You mean like salad and fruit?
m_ex_crust_02_10,"Yes. They're simple, but that's why I like them."
m_ex_crust_02_11,"Hehe, good to know."
m_ex_crust_02_12,I'll make a mental note for when I'm preparing your meals in the future.
m_ex_crust_02_13,Are you only going to cook food that I like?
m_ex_crust_02_14,No.
m_ex_crust_02_15,It's not good for your diet to be too restrictive.
m_ex_crust_02_16,"But almost all of it is made of Splendamin, so isn't it okay?"
m_ex_crust_02_17,That makes it all the more important!
m_ex_crust_02_18,"Even if something is made of Splendamin,"
m_ex_crust_02_19,certain nutrients can still be lost
m_ex_crust_02_20,during the cooking process.
m_ex_crust_02_21,They can?
m_ex_crust_02_22,"Okay, I understand."
m_ex_crust_02_23,"So even if we're talking about dishes made out of Splendamin,"
m_ex_crust_02_24,you have to maintain a well-balanced diet.
m_ex_crust_02_25,And another thing.
m_ex_crust_02_26,Did you know that among the three basic human needs:
m_ex_crust_02_27,"food, clothing, and shelter,"
m_ex_crust_02_28,food is considered the most important?
m_ex_crust_02_29,Is that so?
m_ex_crust_02_30,"Food encapsulates more than the act of eating, it's a way of life!"
m_ex_crust_02_31,"So you should pay more attention to what you're eating, Mr. Gourmand."
m_ex_crust_02_32,"You're an amazing chef, Crust."
m_ex_crust_02_33,Huh?
m_ex_crust_02_34,What do you mean?
m_ex_crust_02_35,"You're very firm in your beliefs when it comes to this, and that's what makes you so impressive."
m_ex_crust_02_36,"Oh, I see!"
m_ex_crust_02_37,Haha.
m_ex_crust_02_38,Of course!
m_ex_crust_02_39,The simple act of cooking doesn't necessarily make you a chef.
m_ex_crust_02_40,"With that being said,"
m_ex_crust_02_41,is there anything in particular you would like to eat for dinner tomorrow?
m_ex_crust_02_42,"We just got some new ingredients,"
m_ex_crust_02_43,so I could whip up just about anything for you.
m_ex_crust_02_44,"A big fat, greasy chicken."
m_ex_crust_02_45,"A light, healthy poke bowl."
m_ex_crust_02_46,I'll prepare some grilled chicken
m_ex_crust_02_47,"with plenty of seasoning,"
m_ex_crust_02_48,and a fresh salad with dressing.
m_ex_crust_02_49,"Hehe, okay."
m_ex_crust_03_1,Mr. Gourmand.
m_ex_crust_03_2,Would you like a dessert as well?
m_ex_crust_03_3,It couldn't hurt.
m_ex_crust_03_4,"Hehe, in that case,"
m_ex_crust_03_5,"I'll prepare some cookies, nuts, potato chips..."
m_ex_crust_03_6,"Ooh, how about instant noodles?"
m_ex_crust_03_7,You also eat instant noodles?
m_ex_crust_03_8,Of course!
m_ex_crust_03_9,"When I'm alone,"
m_ex_crust_03_10,I eat instant noodles on occasion.
m_ex_crust_03_11,"I thought chefs always ate fancy meals, even when they were alone."
m_ex_crust_03_12,No way.
m_ex_crust_03_13,That'd be very impractical.
m_ex_crust_03_14,"I love cooking,"
m_ex_crust_03_15,"but there are times when you're at home and simply don't feel like it, you know?"
m_ex_crust_03_16,Very true.
m_ex_crust_03_17,"So,"
m_ex_crust_03_18,"whenever I'm alone,"
m_ex_crust_03_19,I try and keep it simple.
m_ex_crust_03_20,How simple?
m_ex_crust_03_21,Hmm...
m_ex_crust_03_22,"Well,"
m_ex_crust_03_23,let's take the instant noodles for example.
m_ex_crust_03_24,"First, I boil the water."
m_ex_crust_03_25,Right.
m_ex_crust_03_26,Then I set the table.
m_ex_crust_03_27,I presume that includes the trivet?
m_ex_crust_03_28,"I use separate bowls,"
m_ex_crust_03_29,so there's no need for a trivet.
m_ex_crust_03_30,I do like to lay out a tablecloth
m_ex_crust_03_31,"and matching utensils, though."
m_ex_crust_03_32,?
m_ex_crust_03_33,I also whip up some quick side dishes to go with the noodles.
m_ex_crust_03_34,"Ooh, and while I'm at it,"
m_ex_crust_03_35,I chop up some green onions and chilies.
m_ex_crust_03_36,...
m_ex_crust_03_37,"Oh boy, all this talk about food has got me feeling hungry."
m_ex_crust_03_38,"Just a second, Crust."
m_ex_crust_03_39,What is it?
m_ex_crust_03_40,I don't think you can call that simple.
m_ex_crust_03_41,Oh?
m_ex_crust_03_42,Most people would simply eat the noodles straight out of the pot.
m_ex_crust_03_43,There is no response from Crust for a while.
m_ex_crust_03_44,Hey.
m_ex_crust_03_45,Mr. Gourmand?
m_ex_crust_03_46,Yes?
m_ex_crust_03_47,Have you come to a realization?
m_ex_crust_03_48,I just looked up some stuff online about how people eat.
m_ex_crust_03_49,I didn't realize how... unusual my eating habits were.
m_ex_crust_03_50,You're a true chef from head to toe. That's why I like you.
m_ex_crust_03_51,"Okay, but I honestly do try not to be too fancy with my meals!"
m_ex_crust_03_52,Hehe.
m_ex_crust_03_53,"Fine, forget it."
m_ex_crust_03_54,I'm too hungry to keep talking about this.
m_ex_crust_03_55,Let me show you how to make some genuine instant noodles!
m_ex_crust_03_56,Should I boil the water?
m_ex_crust_03_57,"Yes, please!"
m_ex_bestseller_01_1,Phantom has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_bestseller_01_2,Phantom has invited Arcana to join the group.
m_ex_bestseller_01_3,Phantom has invited Label to join the group.
m_ex_bestseller_01_4,"Alrightt everyone, I made a group cath for the Best Seller Squad."
m_ex_bestseller_01_5,Cool!
m_ex_bestseller_01_6,Who's Label?
m_ex_bestseller_01_7,Oh right.
m_ex_bestseller_01_8,You havn't met her yett.
m_ex_bestseller_01_9,Yeah.
m_ex_bestseller_01_10,"Actually, I haven't seen her for a while myself."
m_ex_bestseller_01_11,You haven't?
m_ex_bestseller_01_12,"Yeah, she's a bit..."
m_ex_bestseller_01_13,"unique, let's say."
m_ex_bestseller_01_14,She's usaully off in her ow n world.
m_ex_bestseller_01_15,For sure!
m_ex_bestseller_01_16,That's what I was gonna say.
m_ex_bestseller_01_17,Doesn't'a seem like she's reading the mssages.
m_ex_bestseller_01_18,I wouLdn't be suprised.
m_ex_bestseller_01_19,"Still, if we made a groupa hcat withot her,"
m_ex_bestseller_01_20,her feelings mighrt get hurt if she found otau after the fact.
m_ex_bestseller_01_21,So I deicded toi nvite her anyway.
m_ex_bestseller_01_22,Yeah
m_ex_bestseller_01_23,that kind of thing can really hurt.
m_ex_bestseller_01_24,"Has that happened to you before, Arcana?"
m_ex_bestseller_01_25,No.
m_ex_bestseller_01_26,Then how do you know?
m_ex_bestseller_01_27,"I can imagine how painful that would be, and how sad it'd make her,"
m_ex_bestseller_01_28,and I'm being sympathetic!

m_ex_bestseller_01_53,She seems like regular ol' Phantom to me.

m_ex_bestseller_01_55,"If yo uhad to spend ayear with Arcana,"

m_ex_bestseller_02_14,What were you even looking for?
m_ex_bestseller_02_15,A hair tie.
m_ex_bestseller_02_16,"When we were eating lunnch earleir,"
m_ex_bestseller_02_17,I not iced that Arcana's hair tie was cmoing loose.

m_ex_bestseller_02_38,That's fine. You could come visit me.
m_ex_bestseller_02_39,Are you really okay with going to jail?
m_ex_bestseller_02_40,"If I don't get imprisoned, that's all the better."
m_ex_bestseller_02_41,"But if I do get caught while doing something bad,"
m_ex_bestseller_02_42,it's only fair that I should pay for my crimes :(
m_ex_bestseller_02_43,Would you still love me

m_ex_arcanearchive_01_12,"She started walking around, then went into some kind of fugue state and won't acknowledge me, so I'm following her for now."
m_ex_arcanearchive_01_13,Hmm...
m_ex_arcanearchive_01_14,Sounds liike she's in some kind oftrance.
m_ex_arcanearchive_01_15,Huh?

m_ex_arcanearchive_01_31,That she did.
m_ex_arcanearchive_01_32,She would aways buy thres and share them with Label and I.
m_ex_arcanearchive_01_33,This tells me that her memo ries are resurfascing.

m_ex_arcanearchive_02_10,That's a huge relef.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_11,Are you two togetther still?
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_12,"Yeah, I'm with Arcana."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_13,Arcana pokes my side while walking alongside me.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_14,We just went outside for some fresh air.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_15,I see.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_16,"Arcana, since your meomries only just cane back,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_17,you might be a bit disoreinted.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_18,"A little, but it's getting better."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_19,I remember you borrowing money from me.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_20,...
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_21,"Your me mory is definily coming back, that for sure."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_22,What makes you say that?
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_23,Arcana as a persin
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_24,doesn't alway match howa she looks.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_25,Hmm...
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_26,"Arcana is beside me, staring absentmindedly into space."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_27,"Howeevr,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_28,you can take it sslow and start to undersatnd your true self.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_29,Yeah!
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_30,You're right!
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_31,I can take it slow.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_32,"After all, I've got plenty of time."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_33,"Well, I sholda get back to work."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_34,I thought you said that you were finished.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_35,"Actually, that wasn't true."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_36,"I cut work short becaue I was worried about Arcana, but thanmks to you, I can sew she's okay."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_37,I think I can head back to finsih off what I was doinag.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_38,"Take carr of her for me, Monsieur."
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_39,Will do.
m_ex_arcanearchive_02_40,"See you later, Phantom."

m_ex_arcanearchive_03_5,"Before you head out,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_6,how about the three of us have dinner?
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_7,I don't know...
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_8,"Listen,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_9,we're all doing these jobs just to get by.
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_10,"Instead of spending our entire lives working, we might as well enjoy a nice meal once in a while."
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_11,Is that so...?
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_12,Makes sernse to me.
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_13,"I am q luitte hungry, atcually."

m_ex_arcanearchive_03_21,"Yeah, that's it!"
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_22,I'm fine with that.
m_ex_arcanearchive_03_23,Any friends of Phantom's are friends of mine.

m_ex_arcanearchive_03_26,"[Map]

m_ex_arcanearchive_03_27,See you there!
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_1,Phantom.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_2,Do you know the Commander's phone number?
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_3,"If you do,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_4,would you mind...
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_5,"I do have his numb er,"
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_6,but I hardly tink it's ncesasr5y at this point.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_7,Hahaha.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_8,The fact that you're mixung up chat rooms
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_9,proves beyond a shadow ofa doubtt that your memory is back.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_10,Does she do this often?
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_11,Once or ticwe a day.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_12,Does that not pose any problems?
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_13,You evntually give up and just accepot it.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_14,Hmm.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_15,Excuse me for a momemnt.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_16,Sure.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_17,"After about 5 minutes, Phantom sends another message."
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_18,Arcana came to visdit.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_19,"She was a bit flustered, and waas trying to delete some onf her messages."
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_20,but droped her phone
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_21,and ended up breaking her sdcreen.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_22,"Hehe, that must have rattled her."
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_23,Oh boy.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_24,"At any rate, she wanst me to tell you somerthing on her behgalf."
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_25,Woulkd it be okay if I gave her your phaone nubmer?
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_26,"Sure, that's fine."
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_27,Okay.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_28,She says she'll reacbh out once she fixs her phone scr een.
m_ex_arcanearchive_04_29,Tell her I said no problem.
m_ex_arcana_01_1,Hello {AccountData.NickName}.
m_ex_arcana_01_2,It's Arcana. Did Phantom get in touch with you?
m_ex_arcana_01_3,She did. Hello.
m_ex_arcana_01_4,This feels like some kind of blind date.
m_ex_arcana_01_5,"Oooh, I always wanted to try that!"
m_ex_arcana_01_6,Let's pretend that Phantom set us up.
m_ex_arcana_01_7,Okay.
m_ex_arcana_01_8,Did Phantom get in touch with you?
m_ex_arcana_01_9,She did. Hello.
m_ex_arcana_01_10,"I'm sorry to ask,"
m_ex_arcana_01_11,but Phantom never sent me a photo of you.
m_ex_arcana_01_12,Would you mind sending one now?
m_ex_arcana_01_13,"I'm sorry, but my line of work means I can't send photos of myself on open channels."
m_ex_arcana_01_14,Oh!
m_ex_arcana_01_15,Do you work for the government?
m_ex_arcana_01_16,Something like that.
m_ex_arcana_01_17,Then...
m_ex_arcana_01_18,Hmm.
m_ex_arcana_01_19,This isn't as fun
m_ex_arcana_01_20,as I thought it'd be.
m_ex_arcana_01_21,I imagined butterflies in my stomach and fluttering hearts all around.
m_ex_arcana_01_22,Haha.
m_ex_arcana_01_23,Are first meetings
m_ex_arcana_01_24,always like this?
m_ex_arcana_01_25,Maybe because
m_ex_arcana_01_26,it's a blind date?
m_ex_arcana_01_27,You're right. It does feel oddly awkward for some reason.
m_ex_arcana_01_28,"Next time,"
m_ex_arcana_01_29,we can act out something else.
m_ex_arcana_01_30,"At any rate, I'll stick to the work I'm assigned to do, okay?"
m_ex_arcana_01_31,All right.
m_ex_arcana_01_32,"From here on out, at last officially speaking,"
m_ex_arcana_01_33,I'm now a Nikke under your command.
m_ex_arcana_01_34,"That does make things a little awkward for me with regard to the Forbidden Library, though."
m_ex_arcana_01_35,Don't worry. Just keep doing what you've been doing.
m_ex_arcana_01_36,"But if I do that,"
m_ex_arcana_01_37,it'll make me a bit sad.
m_ex_arcana_01_38,I guess you prefer the tragic story of a girl who perpetually loses her memory.
m_ex_arcana_01_39,I'm simply saying that you can work like usual.
m_ex_arcana_01_40,Okay.
m_ex_arcana_01_41,"Anyway,"
m_ex_arcana_01_42,do you remember the other thing we talked about?
m_ex_arcana_01_43,You mean our collaboration?
m_ex_arcana_01_44,Yup!
m_ex_arcana_01_45,I'm super excited for it.
m_ex_arcana_02_1,What are you up to?
m_ex_arcana_02_2,I see Arcana's message but don't answer because I'm in the middle of a game.
m_ex_arcana_02_3,What's going on? My message is showing up as read.
m_ex_arcana_02_4,"Ah, I get it."
m_ex_arcana_02_5,"You're playing hard to get, aren't you?"
m_ex_arcana_02_6,"All right, fine. You better answer me in 10 minutes."
m_ex_arcana_02_7,"If you make me wait any longer, this plan of yours is gonna backfire."
m_ex_arcana_02_8,Sorry! I was doing something else.
m_ex_arcana_02_9,Were you gaming?
m_ex_arcana_02_10,How did you know?
m_ex_arcana_02_11,You told me before how you like to play video games.
m_ex_arcana_02_12,"Also, 9 times out of 10,"
m_ex_arcana_02_13,the reason men aren't punctual with their replies is because they're gaming.
m_ex_arcana_02_14,That's what I read on the internet.
m_ex_arcana_02_15,What's the other 1 out of 10?
m_ex_arcana_02_16,They're with another woman.
m_ex_arcana_02_17,"I was gaming, promise."
m_ex_arcana_02_18,"Haha, you don't need to defend yourself."
m_ex_arcana_02_19,"But,"
m_ex_arcana_02_20,what if I were to ask you
m_ex_arcana_02_21,whether you thought video games or me were more important?
m_ex_arcana_02_22,Hmm...
m_ex_arcana_02_23,I bet that type of question would put you in a tight spot.
m_ex_arcana_02_24,So I won't ask.
m_ex_arcana_02_25,Did you message me because you're bored?
m_ex_arcana_02_26,"Not really because I'm bored,"
m_ex_arcana_02_27,but I had less work to do than usual.
m_ex_arcana_02_28,"I'm pretty much finished with everything,"
m_ex_arcana_02_29,but I can't leave work early.
m_ex_arcana_02_30,"Soooo I'm sitting here in the Forbidden Library, zoning out."
m_ex_arcana_02_31,I can come over if you want.
m_ex_arcana_02_32,"But if you came here, what would you do?"
m_ex_arcana_02_33,"There's not much to do here, and we can't go outside either."
m_ex_arcana_02_34,You'll just be bored.
m_ex_arcana_02_35,Then we can be bored together.
m_ex_arcana_02_36,Haha.
m_ex_arcana_02_37,You're already
m_ex_arcana_02_38,registered in the biometric lock
m_ex_arcana_02_39,that leads inside.
m_ex_arcana_02_40,You should be able to come in no problem.
m_ex_arcana_02_41,I'll bring lemon tea and some snacks.
m_ex_arcana_02_42,"After I've finished getting ready and am reaching for my phone, I get a message."
m_ex_arcana_02_43,♥
m_ex_arcana_03_1,I have to tell you that I'm a little upset.
m_ex_arcana_03_2,What? Why?
m_ex_arcana_03_3,It's not like
m_ex_arcana_03_4,"I was expecting you to respond with tears of joy,"
m_ex_arcana_03_5,but you could have at least
m_ex_arcana_03_6,thanked me for the gift.
m_ex_arcana_03_7,I don't understand.
m_ex_arcana_03_8,It took me forever to work up the courage to say this.
m_ex_arcana_03_9,Hold on.
m_ex_arcana_03_10,I feel so pathetic and clingy now.
m_ex_arcana_03_11,"And honestly, I know I'm being clingy,"
m_ex_arcana_03_12,but so what?
m_ex_arcana_03_13,"I check around for any deliveries, but there's nothing."
m_ex_arcana_03_14,What gift? I didn't get anything.
m_ex_arcana_03_15,What?
m_ex_arcana_03_16,What did you send?
m_ex_arcana_03_17,Wait.
m_ex_arcana_03_18,Just a moment.
m_ex_arcana_03_19,Arcana doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_arcana_03_20,!
m_ex_arcana_03_21,!!!
m_ex_arcana_03_22,??
m_ex_arcana_03_23,I sent it to the wrong address!
m_ex_arcana_03_24,...
m_ex_arcana_03_25,I accidently
m_ex_arcana_03_26,had it shipped to the library.
m_ex_arcana_03_27,I see.
m_ex_arcana_03_28,"It showed up as delivered two days ago,"
m_ex_arcana_03_29,so I thought you had already received it.
m_ex_arcana_03_30,Turns out it's in our mail room.
m_ex_arcana_03_31,Oh well.
m_ex_arcana_03_32,"I'll just ask Boss to erase all my memories concerning this, hehe."
m_ex_arcana_03_33,"Haha, it's okay. These things happen."
m_ex_arcana_03_34,"Sure,"
m_ex_arcana_03_35,"it's not a big deal to mess up the address,"
m_ex_arcana_03_36,but to sit around
m_ex_arcana_03_37,moping and whining about it...
m_ex_arcana_03_38,"So, what's the gift anyway?"
m_ex_arcana_03_39,Some cologne
m_ex_arcana_03_40,that I thought would suit you.
m_ex_arcana_03_41,I'll stop by and pick it up.
m_ex_arcana_03_42,No!
m_ex_arcana_03_43,You can't come now!
m_ex_arcana_03_44,Hahaha.
m_ex_arcana_03_45,Are you antagonizing me on purpose?
m_ex_arcana_03_46,Give me some time to calm myself down.
m_ex_arcana_03_47,I just need a moment.
m_ex_arcana_03_48,"Okay, okay."
m_ex_arcana_03_49,I'll resend
m_ex_arcana_03_50,the cologne to you.
m_ex_arcana_03_51,Thanks. I'm sure I'll get a lot out of it.
m_ex_arcana_03_52,Great.
m_ex_arcana_03_53,I'll be checking to make sure you do!
m_ex_arcana_03_54,"Haha, all right."
m_ex_arcana_03_55,Also.
m_ex_arcana_03_56,I'm sorry for all that stuff I said earlier.
m_ex_arcana_03_57,It's okay.
m_ex_arcana_03_58,Hehe :P
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_1,It's summerrrr!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_2,It's BOOMMMMMM!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_3,It's the oceannnnn!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_4,Yeahhhhhh!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_5,"Boy oh boy,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_6,I already miss the ocean.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_7,This last expedition was awesome!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_8,The ocean was way cooler than I expected.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_9,Making swimsuits was a blast too.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_10,"Your profile picture is from that time, right?"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_11,Good eye!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_12,I changed it since it's summer.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_13,Looking at that photo really brings me back.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_14,It's not every day I get to wear a swimsuit.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_15,I should have taken more photos to commemorate the occasion.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_16,You could wear it at the pool and take photos there.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_17,Huh?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_18,Mr. Commander!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_19,What are you talking about?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_20,The pool and the ocean are two totally different things.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_21,They can't even be compared.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_22,But weren't you playing around in the cruise ship's pool during this mission?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_23,"That pool is on a cruise ship,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_24,and the ship was on the ocean.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_25,"Ergo,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_26,I technically wore a swimsuit at the ocean.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_27,Do you see the difference?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_28,I think I do.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_29,Not really.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_30,I knew you'd understand!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_31,"A pool on a cruise ship and a regular swimming pool are totally different,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_32,both in terms of location and the circumstances surrounding them.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_33,What? I thought for sure you of all people would understand.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_34,Now I'm sad...
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_35,Anyway.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_36,The next time I wear a swimsuit
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_37,will be the next time I'm at the ocean again.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_38,"Until then, the swimsuit is sealed away."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_39,That's a shame.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_40,Well...
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_41,"If you really want to see it,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_42,I could put it on.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_43,Why don't we both go to the pool next weekend?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_44,Do we need to go to the pool?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_45,I'm kind of lazy.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_46,I'll just put on my swimsuit next time I come over.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_47,Isn't that a better idea?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_01_48,Hehehe.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_1,Mr. Commander!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_2,It's time to BOOM!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_3,Again with BOOM?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_4,What are you talking about?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_5,This is no ordinary BOOM.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_6,This is Ocean BOOM!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_7,What's Ocean BOOM?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_8,!!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_9,"Don't you know anything, Mr. Commander?"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_10,The ocean is awesome.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_11,BOOM is awesome too.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_12,And—
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_13,"If you put them together,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_14,you've got something that's double awesome!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_15,"I get the rationale, but what actually is it?"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_16,Huh?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_17,Ocean BOOM is Ocean BOOM.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_18,Haven't you seen it before?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_19,I have no idea what Elegg is saying.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_20,"No, I don't think I have."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_21,No way!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_22,That's too bad.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_23,It's really awesome.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_24,"From far off in the ocean, suddenly... BOOM!"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_25,"There's this massive boom, followed by a huge plume of smoke."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_26,Seems like a volcano erupted.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_27,Ding ding ding!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_28,The true identity of Ocean BOOM
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_29,is a volcanic eruption!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_30,You really didn't see it?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_31,It was visible even from the deck.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_32,I must have been somewhere else at the time.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_33,"Aw,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_34,that's a shame.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_35,I really want to see it again.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_36,To think we were able to witness such an incredible sight!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_37,The ocean is a really nice place.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_38,I'd say I even like it half as much as BOOM.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_39,"No, scratch that. One third."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_40,"Actually, let's go with one fourth."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_41,But wait... if Ocean BOOM is both combined...
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_42,!!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_43,That would mean it's even cooler than BOOM itself!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_44,But nothing can be cooler than BOOM.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_45,Let's just conclude that Ocean BOOM is half as cool as BOOM.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_46,"I hope you get to see it one day for yourself, Mr. Commander."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_02_47,"I hope so, too."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_1,There are all sorts of interesting things in the ocean up here.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_2,"I was glancing out at the water,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_3,and saw a fish with wings flying around!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_4,That was probably a flying fish.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_5,Really?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_6,A flying fish?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_7,"Wow, it even advertises the fact that it can fly in the name!"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_8,Yeah!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_9,"I thought it was a bird at first,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_10,"but when I looked closer, it actually was a fish."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_11,I thought creatures like that only existed in video games.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_12,I was totally shocked
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_13,to discover that such things exist in real life!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_14,Hold on!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_15,Does that mean
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_16,dragons could exist somewhere on the surface too?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_17,That may be a bit of a stretch.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_18,Then how about unicorns?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_19,Probably not.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_20,Then surely there must be a mouse that shoots electricity?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_21,"Doubt it, but there is a fish that shoots electricity."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_22,!!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_23,For real?!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_24,It's called an electric eel.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_25,Electric eel.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_26,Even the name is cool!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_27,"First fish that fly,"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_28,and now fish that fire electricity.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_29,The ocean is really a cool place!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_30,It's like a dungeon in a video game.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_31,"All right, no time to waste."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_32,We've gotta gear up right away
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_33,and head out to find an electric eel!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_34,We can't do that.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_35,Huh?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_36,Why not?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_37,They live in rivers.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_38,Not in the ocean?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_39,Whyyyyyy?!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_40,I don't know. They just evolved that way?
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_41,Darn it!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_42,I wanted to see a fish
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_43,that shoots electricity!
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_44,Sorry to disappoint you.
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_45,"Still, who's to say there aren't electrified fish living somewhere in the ocean?"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_46,"It's a big place, after all."
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_47,"One of these days, I'll find one!"
m_ex_elegg_boomandshock_03_48,"And when I do, I'll tell you!"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_1,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_2,"sorry to disturb you,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_3,but have you seen Rapi?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_4,"No, I haven't."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_5,I see.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_6,This is troubling.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_7,"If you don't know where she is, then I have no other leads."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_8,What's wrong?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_9,Nothing serious.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_10,"We were supposed to have tea time together,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_11,but she hasn't shown up.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_12,"Haha, you two have gotten pretty close."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_13,How many times do I have to say this?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_14,I have no intention on becoming friends with Rapi.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_15,"We communicate fairly well,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_16,and she also has surprisingly good taste in tea.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_17,"Therefore, we meet up from time to time. That's all."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_18,Be honest. You enjoyed exploring that ship with everyone.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_19,It wasn't bad.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_20,I see you changed your profile picture to you in a swimsuit?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_21,...
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_22,I'd grown tired of my old profile picture.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_23,That's all.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_24,"Haha, if you say so."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_25,Oh.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_26,Rapi is here.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_27,She said she was late because of work.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_28,Mmm.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_29,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_30,do you have a moment?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_31,"Yeah, I'm taking a break right now."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_32,"Then,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_33,allow me to extend a formal invitation to you as well.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_34,I can join too?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_35,Yes.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_36,"Having a few extra people over for tea can be a good thing,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_37,and I happen to have some tea leaves left over.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_01_38,I appreciate the invite. I'll be right there.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_1,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_2,I have a favor to ask.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_3,"You, asking a favor? I can't believe it."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_4,What are you talking about?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_5,I'm perfectly capable of asking for a favor
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_6,when I need something.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_7,"All right, then, what is it?"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_8,...
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_9,May I borrow the pool for a day?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_10,The one at the Outpost?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_11,Yes.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_12,Exactly.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_13,Why do you need to borrow the swimming pool there?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_14,I want to set a certain mood.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_15,Come again?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_16,Do you remember the magnolia tea
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_17,we had last time?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_18,The one we all drank together on the cruise ship?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_19,That's right.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_20,"I was reminiscing on our time there, and I had the tea again,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_21,but it didn't taste the same as when we drank it on the ship.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_22,"I was curious as to why that is,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_23,and I came to the conclusion perhaps it is because my surroundings are different.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_24,"Therefore, I want to recreate the atmosphere from that mission as much as possible."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_25,"Going all the way back up to the surface, and the ocean,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_26,"would be too much of a hassle,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_27,so I was going to try having tea at the pool.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_28,"I also don't want to run into any other Nikkes,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_29,"so if you'd let me borrow it for a day, I would greatly appreciate it."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_30,"Shouldn't we invite everyone, though?"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_31,Excuse me?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_32,"If your goal is to recreate the atmosphere from our last mission, then you should invite all the people who were there."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_33,All of them?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_34,I just told you; I don't want to run into any other Nikkes.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_35,I'll contact them.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_36,...
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_37,You're nothing if not persistent.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_38,Fine.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_39,Go ahead.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_40,I have plenty of tea leaves to spare anyway.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_02_41,Okay. I'll check everyone's schedule and get back to you.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_1,"Your Grace,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_2,did you leave this box
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_3,on my desk?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_4,How did you know?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_5,No one would leave something for me
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_6,that's clearly a gift.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_7,No one but you.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_8,Hehe.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_9,Well?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_10,What is it?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_11,"I saw it while I was out and about, and thought it would suit you."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_12,Hmm...
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_13,"It doesn't seem dangerous,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_14,so I'll open it.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_15,Oh!
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_16,A pair of teacups.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_17,Emblazoned with sky-blue waves
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_18,and pink dolphins.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_19,What about this made you think of me?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_20,It reminded me of you flying above the ocean.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_21,I see.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_22,I like it.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_23,"The next time I have tea, I will be sure to invite you."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_24,That'd be great.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_25,I should think about what tea will go well with this teacup.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_26,Should I extend an invite to Rapi as well?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_27,Rapi?
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_28,...
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_29,No.
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_30,"There are only two teacups,"
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_31,"so this time, it'll be just you and me."
m_ex_dorothy_serendipity_03_32,I'll be in touch.
m_ex_k_01_1,.
m_ex_k_01_2,?
m_ex_k_01_3,K?
m_ex_k_01_4,Is that really you?
m_ex_k_01_5,Of course it is. You think there's a fake K running around?
m_ex_k_01_6,Send me a friend request.
m_ex_k_01_7,Wow. I never thought I'd be chatting with you of all people.
m_ex_k_01_8,I never imagined
m_ex_k_01_9,I'd be installing an app like this either.
m_ex_k_01_10,?
m_ex_k_01_11,What? What is it?
m_ex_k_01_12,Hold on.
m_ex_k_01_13,You're telling me you've never had BlaBla up until now?
m_ex_k_01_14,Nope.
m_ex_k_01_15,Why not?
m_ex_k_01_16,Didn't see the point.
m_ex_k_01_17,Why use this when I can just call people?
m_ex_k_01_18,"If I need to send files, I use text or email."
m_ex_k_01_19,"Okay, fair enough, but..."
m_ex_k_01_20,"Now, however,"
m_ex_k_01_21,I have to keep in touch with you more often.
m_ex_k_01_22,"I got tired of sending text messages all the time, so I installed this app."
m_ex_k_01_23,Smart move.
m_ex_k_01_24,Welcome to the modern world.
m_ex_k_01_25,What are you blabbering about?
m_ex_k_01_26,At least you know how to type.
m_ex_k_01_27,%@%@^!$!
m_ex_k_01_28,Huh? Why does it look like that?
m_ex_k_01_29,LOL
m_ex_k_01_30,Head to the settings and turn off the profanity filter.
m_ex_k_01_31,Wow. These modern apps have everything.
m_ex_k_01_32,Anyway.
m_ex_k_01_33,I'll be using this to message you from here on out.
m_ex_k_01_34,Cool with you?
m_ex_k_01_35,Fine by me.
m_ex_k_01_36,Just don't use this to send me any sensitive information.
m_ex_k_01_37,Got it. I'll keep a secure line for that stuff.
m_ex_k_01_38,Sounds good.
m_ex_k_01_39,"I'm counting on you,"
m_ex_k_01_40,you know that?
m_ex_k_01_41,I doubt the Judges are going to let me off easy on this.
m_ex_k_01_42,Perhaps.
m_ex_k_01_43,"To be honest,"
m_ex_k_01_44,even I'm not sure how this will end.
m_ex_k_01_45,It's a totally unprecedented case.
m_ex_k_01_46,Truly.
m_ex_k_01_47,"Anyway, I'm off."
m_ex_k_01_48,"Okay. Feel free to message me whenever you want, even if it's something personal."
m_ex_k_02_1,Seriously?
m_ex_k_02_2,Whoa!
m_ex_k_02_3,Ms. K!
m_ex_k_02_4,?
m_ex_k_02_5,"So, you are alive."
m_ex_k_02_6,What are you on about?
m_ex_k_02_7,Did you hit your head or what?
m_ex_k_02_8,That's because you've been radio silent for a while.
m_ex_k_02_9,Just checking in to see if you're still alive.
m_ex_k_02_10,I'm very much alive.
m_ex_k_02_11,Just doing my job.
m_ex_k_02_12,"After that reply, K sends no more messages."
m_ex_k_02_13,...
m_ex_k_02_14,That's it?
m_ex_k_02_15,You're done chatting?
m_ex_k_02_16,"You confirmed that I wasn't dead, didn't you?"
m_ex_k_02_17,That's why I got in touch in the first place.
m_ex_k_02_18,"Sure,"
m_ex_k_02_19,but come on!
m_ex_k_02_20,At least tell me what kind of work you're doing.
m_ex_k_02_21,Apprehending bad guys and killing them.
m_ex_k_02_22,How's it going?
m_ex_k_02_23,Very well.
m_ex_k_02_24,You're well aware
m_ex_k_02_25,"they just keep showing up endlessly, these damn criminals."
m_ex_k_02_26,That they do.
m_ex_k_02_27,You're not curious?
m_ex_k_02_28,About what?
m_ex_k_02_29,Like...
m_ex_k_02_30,the kind of people I've apprehended.
m_ex_k_02_31,Whether they're dead or alive.
m_ex_k_02_32,"After all, I'm under your command now."
m_ex_k_02_33,Aren't you even a little curious about that?
m_ex_k_02_34,"Well, you're the expert on all that."
m_ex_k_02_35,I trust you to handle it.
m_ex_k_02_36,Really?
m_ex_k_02_37,...
m_ex_k_02_38,But what if I make the wrong call?
m_ex_k_02_39,What if I end up killing someone who's innocent?
m_ex_k_02_40,That won't happen.
m_ex_k_02_41,Why not?
m_ex_k_02_42,Because the K I know wouldn't let that happen.
m_ex_k_02_43,Is that so?
m_ex_k_02_44,"Just when I was wondering if I should message again, K replies."
m_ex_k_02_45,I'll send regular reports.
m_ex_k_02_46,About once every two days.
m_ex_k_02_47,Sounds good.
m_ex_k_02_48,I'm off then.
m_ex_k_03_1,{AccountData.NickName}.
m_ex_k_03_2,Got a minute?
m_ex_k_03_3,Right now?
m_ex_k_03_4,Yeah.
m_ex_k_03_5,Take a look at this.
m_ex_k_03_6,"Hey honey, are you free this evening? Let's hang out! AK4234"
m_ex_k_03_7,"Okay, where should we go?"
m_ex_k_03_8,Did you get a spam message?
m_ex_k_03_9,%@$%@
m_ex_k_03_10,Are you messing with me?
m_ex_k_03_11,Hehe. Did you get a spam message?
m_ex_k_03_12,Yeah. I think it came in the day before yesterday.
m_ex_k_03_13,"Something about it didn't smell right,"
m_ex_k_03_14,so I tried adding them to dig deeper.
m_ex_k_03_15,But it didn't go well?
m_ex_k_03_16,Not at all. I think they caught on to me.
m_ex_k_03_17,"Unlike D,"
m_ex_k_03_18,I'm not the best at acting.
m_ex_k_03_19,What strategy did you go for?
m_ex_k_03_20,"I switched to a different account. Here, I'll show you."
m_ex_k_03_21,"Robert: So, where are we going?  Lina: Anywhere is okay with me.
Lina: Are you rich, Big Boy?             Robert: I am.
Lina: Really?? How much?           Robert: Let's talk when we meet.
Lina: Hehe. You wanted to see me that bad?
Lina: I'm kind of expensive. You okay with that?
Robert: How expensive, exactly?"
m_ex_k_03_22,"Ugh, why is copy-paste so messed up here?"
m_ex_k_03_23,Whatever. You get the idea.
m_ex_k_03_24,It seems fine to me.
m_ex_k_03_25,Is that everything?
m_ex_k_03_26,Yeah. They stopped responding after that.
m_ex_k_03_27,Hmm...
m_ex_k_03_28,You should make a new ID and message them too.
m_ex_k_03_29,"If they respond, that means I got them."
m_ex_k_03_30,"If not, something else is up."
m_ex_k_03_31,Got it. I'll try.
m_ex_k_03_32,"Look at you, making secondary accounts. You're starting to get the hang of BlaBla."
m_ex_k_03_33,You're mistaken in thinking I don't know how to use this app.
m_ex_k_03_34,I just didn't care about it.
m_ex_k_03_35,Figuring out how to use it is easy.
m_ex_k_03_36,"Ha, fair enough."
m_ex_k_03_37,Okay.
m_ex_k_03_38,"I create an anonymous account, and get a response to a message I sent to Lina."
m_ex_k_03_39,She replied.
m_ex_k_03_40,So they found me out.
m_ex_k_03_41,Try luring her out slowly.
m_ex_k_03_42,That's something you're good at.
m_ex_k_03_43,All right.
m_ex_k_03_44,"Anyway,"
m_ex_k_03_45,I'll be standing by.
m_ex_k_03_46,I'll let you know once everything's set.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_1,Arcana has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_2,Arcana has invited Moran to join the group.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_3,Moran?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_4,Don't you have something to say to me?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_5,"You too, {AccountData.NickName}!"
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_6,Huh?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_7,"Arcana, I can explain."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_8,Why can't I find K's ID on BlaBla?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_9,"Anyway, trying to make excuses now, you two?"
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_10,Go ahead. Try me.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_11,I ended up cleaning the entire reading room on my own.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_12,You'd better give me a good explanation.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_13,...
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_14,...
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_15,"Are you going to admit you were wrong, or not?"
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_16,... I'm sorry.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_17,... I'm sorry.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_18,"Are you really sorry, or just saying that?"
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_19,I'm really sorry.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_20,Me too.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_21,"Something urgent came up, and I forgot about the library."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_22,...
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_23,"Well, I at least appreciate your honesty."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_24,I won't hold it against you.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_25,Let's consider this matter closed.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_26,"By the way, Cadet."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_27,This is a good chance
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_28,to check the key.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_29,"Ah, right. Arcana."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_30,Yes?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_31,You remember the room we saw earlier?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_32,The one with the Perilous Siege records?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_33,What was the number for that room again?
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_34,S-1452.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_35,"Moran, who's walking beside Arcana, clicks her tongue disapprovingly upon seeing Arcana's message."
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_36,Thanks. I'll be in touch.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_37,All right.
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_38,"I'm not entirely sure what's going on,"
m_ex_lordforjustice_01_39,"but whatever it is, take care."
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_1,Cadet.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_2,"Thinking back on it,"
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_3,I feel like I rushed out of there awfully quick.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_4,I don't quite know how to put it...
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_5,It was like I was caught up in myself.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_6,Cadet?
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_7,Doesn't seem like he's paying attention to his phone.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_8,Maybe he's busy.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_9,Hmm...
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_10,Did something serious happen?
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_11,Yeah.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_12,"Well, for K, at least."
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_13,Ah-ha!
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_14,No wonder the ever-so-kind Commander is trying
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_15,to help out.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_16,That's right.
m_ex_lordforjustice_02_17,Classic Commander.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_1,"Still no response, huh..."
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_2,Are you worried?
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_3,"A bit, yeah."
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_4,Aren't you?
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_5,Nah.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_6,He promised that he'd reach out
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_7,once things are sorted.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_8,And you trust him?
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_9,Absolutely.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_10,"For Cadet,"
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_11,he can just get through anything.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_12,Then I'll follow your lead.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_13,"I'll trust that {AccountData.NickName} will keep the promise he made to me, and wait."
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_14,What promise did he make with you?
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_15,That's a secret.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_16,Fine. I guess I can't pry too much if it's a secret.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_17,"Oh, by the way."
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_18,I just finished what I was working on.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_19,Mind if I drop by the library?
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_20,I want to borrow a few books
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_21,and apologize for that mess I made earlier.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_22,Sure! Come by anytime.
m_ex_lordforjustice_03_23,Cool. On my way.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_1,Arcana has invited K to join the group.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_2,K!
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_3,I heard you finally set up a BlaBla ID for yourself.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_4,Congratulations!
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_5,Huh?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_6,It took her this long?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_7,Apparently.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_8,I didn't know it was possible for someone not to have BlaBla.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_9,What's so hard to believe about that?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_10,It's the same as texting.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_11,Er...
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_12,I guess you're right.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_13,Actually... why do we even use BlaBla?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_14,Now that you mention it...
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_15,We fell for their marketing.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_16,It's the vibes. They're totally different with this app.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_17,"Anyway, now that I've congratulated you..."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_18,"Is there anything you'd like to say to me, K?"
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_19,Oh boy. Here we go...
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_20,LOL
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_21,Say what?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_22,You knocked over all those bookshelves when you left before!
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_23,I had to clean it up all by myself. It was awful!
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_24,?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_25,Why are you blaming me?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_26,"That was Moran, not me."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_27,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_28,Then why am I yelling at you?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_29,You tell me.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_30,"Come to think of it,"
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_31,you chewed me out last time too.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_32,That's because you were the one in charge!
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_33,Just admit that you messed up.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_34,"Okay, fine."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_35,I messed up.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_36,And are you sorry?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_37,"Yes, I'm sorry."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_38,"Hey, Moran."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_39,Care to chime in?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_40,Huh? What is it?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_41,About what you did at the library.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_42,"Oh, the library? I borrowed the dinosaur encyclopedia."
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_43,?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_44,?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_45,?
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_46,"I couldn't reach Cadet or K,"
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_47,so I went to the library and checked out that book.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_48,Wanna see it? It's super cool.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_49,Dinosaurs are seriously awesome.
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_50,ROFL
m_ex_lordforjustice_04_51,I'm done with this conversation.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_1,D has invited {AccountData.NickName} to join the group.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_2,D has invited K to join the group.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_3,"Finally, we can bring everyone up to speed in one fell swoop."
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_4,I still can't over the fact that
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_5,K only installed BlaBla recently.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_6,Did I ask for your input?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_7,"I've got it now, so let's move on already."
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_8,1-10.zip
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_9,11-20.zip
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_10,21-30.zip
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_11,What's all this?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_12,Mission data we couldn't share before.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_13,Make sure to review it by tomorrow.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_14,?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_15,Do I have to?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_16,I'm under {AccountData.NickName}'s direct command now.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_17,"Be that as it may,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_18,you're still part of Perilous Siege.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_19,No alterations to the command structure will change that.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_20,I agree.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_21,Tsk.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_22,"Fine, I'll look at it."
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_23,?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_24,What's going on?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_25,How come this isn't downloading?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_26,Let me try.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_27,Downloading 1-10.zip...
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_28,Downloading 11-20.zip...
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_29,Download complete.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_30,Downloading 21-30.zip...
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_31,Download complete.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_32,Download complete.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_33,Works fine for me.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_34,Weird. It's not working on my end.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_35,Check your phone model.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_36,Hold on.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_37,MAW-E10S.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_38,Is that an old model? Let me look it up.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_39,"Upon searching the model,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_40,it turns out K's phone was released 10 years ago.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_41,"Uh, K..."
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_42,You need to get a new phone.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_43,?
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_44,Why? It's still working fine.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_45,I'll go with you. Let's get this sorted quickly.
m_ex_siegeperilous_01_46,"I told you, it's working fine!"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_1,"Honey,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_2,are you awake?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_3,Yeah.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_4,Did you sleep well?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_5,Yes.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_6,"You only have one day left on your business trip, right?"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_7,Today will be the last time
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_8,I wake up alone.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_9,!
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_10,^@%$^$
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_11,This is driving me crazy.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_12,What the hell is wrong with you?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_13,Why are you doing this here
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_14,instead of a personal message?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_15,You ought to be aware of our current setup
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_16,so you'll be equipped to handle any unexpected situations that crop up.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_17,...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_18,I'm only doing this for the sake of the mission.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_19,"I'm meeting you half-way here,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_20,so please take it seriously.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_21,"At any rate, I wanted to add more to our arrangement."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_22,In that case...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_23,Yes?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_24,"If we were to add more to the arrangement,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_25,what about making K my sister-in-law?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_26,What?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_27,What?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_28,...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_29,"What in the world are you talking about, Honey?"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_30,Sister-in-law?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_31,Seriously?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_32,"I don't even have a sister. At least, not that kind."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_33,{AccountData.NickName}.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_34,Get your mind out of the gutter!
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_35,"That's a bit much,"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_36,"even for you, Honey."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_37,Too much?
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_38,You're one to talk.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_39,"If I'm not qualified to protest, then who is?"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_40,Sorry.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_41,Really...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_42,...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_43,I was wrong.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_44,"No, Honey, you did nothing wrong."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_45,I'm sorry for getting worked up. That's not like me.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_46,"@K, you and I can discuss this further on our own."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_47,Fine by me.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_48,"Today, we settle this once and for all."
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_49,"With words, right?"
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_50,Of course...
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_51,Not.
m_ex_siegeperilous_02_52,... I figured.
m_ex_sora_01_1,"Hiya,"
m_ex_sora_01_2,Captain. ♥
m_ex_sora_01_3,"You remember me, right?"
m_ex_sora_01_4,Of course I do.
m_ex_sora_01_5,Who is this?
m_ex_sora_01_6,"Hehe, I figured you would. ♥"
m_ex_sora_01_7,Good thing I gave you my number! ★
m_ex_sora_01_8,"Hehe, nice try, Captain! ★"
m_ex_sora_01_9,You can't fool me. ♥
m_ex_sora_01_10,I clearly saved my number in your phone.
m_ex_sora_01_11,"Anyway, I'm Sora from the Over the Horizon squad! ♥"
m_ex_sora_01_12,Looking forward to working with you again!
m_ex_sora_01_13,"Actually,"
m_ex_sora_01_14,I've been wondering
m_ex_sora_01_15,what would be the best way to reach out to you
m_ex_sora_01_16,for a few days now. ★
m_ex_sora_01_17,"You know what they say, nothing beats going back to the basics!"
m_ex_sora_01_18,"So I figured,"
m_ex_sora_01_19,why not keep it plain ★
m_ex_sora_01_20,and simple ☆
m_ex_sora_01_21,"with a good ol' fashioned greeting, hehe."
m_ex_sora_01_22,Well?
m_ex_sora_01_23,What'd you think of it? ★
m_ex_sora_01_24,I like how simple it is.
m_ex_sora_01_25,"Actually, I think it was a bit too ordinary."
m_ex_sora_01_26,"Hehe, I'm glad you liked it! ♥"
m_ex_sora_01_27,"From the moment I first saw you,"
m_ex_sora_01_28,I could tell you'd appreciate this type of thing. ★
m_ex_sora_01_29,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_sora_01_30,"I thought that'd be what you were into,"
m_ex_sora_01_31,but I guess I was wrong. ★
m_ex_sora_01_32,I will try something a bit more innovative next time. ♥
m_ex_sora_01_33,"Aw, darn. ★"
m_ex_sora_01_34,"My squadmates are here,"
m_ex_sora_01_35,and
m_ex_sora_01_36,they keep interrupting me.
m_ex_sora_01_37,I think
m_ex_sora_01_38,it's because
m_ex_sora_01_39,they're curious
m_ex_sora_01_40,"about what I'm texting you, Captain."
m_ex_sora_01_41,"Haha, oh boy."
m_ex_sora_01_42,This won't do. ★
m_ex_sora_01_43,Give me just a moment.
m_ex_sora_01_44,"Hehe,"
m_ex_sora_01_45,I'll take care of this.
m_ex_sora_01_46,Haha.
m_ex_sora_01_47,Talk to you again soon! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_1,Captain! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_2,I've got a surprise quiz for you. ★
m_ex_sora_02_3,"If you get it right, you get an amazing prize. ♥"
m_ex_sora_02_4,"Get it wrong, and you're in for a scaaary punishment ★"
m_ex_sora_02_5,"So, waddya say?"
m_ex_sora_02_6,Wanna give it a shot?
m_ex_sora_02_7,"Sure, let's go."
m_ex_sora_02_8,I knew you'd be game! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_9,"Okay, here we go. ★"
m_ex_sora_02_10,What's the weather like today?
m_ex_sora_02_11,It's a clear day. Not a cloud in sight.
m_ex_sora_02_12,It's raining.
m_ex_sora_02_13,☆
m_ex_sora_02_14,Whoa!
m_ex_sora_02_15,That's correct!
m_ex_sora_02_16,How did you know?
m_ex_sora_02_17,"Over in the Ark, it's..."
m_ex_sora_02_18,Raining.
m_ex_sora_02_19,That's right! ★
m_ex_sora_02_20,So why did you say that it's a clear day?
m_ex_sora_02_21,I had a feeling you weren't asking about the weather in the Ark.
m_ex_sora_02_22,♥
m_ex_sora_02_23,Haha!
m_ex_sora_02_24,"You really do know me, Captain. ★"
m_ex_sora_02_25,Inside
m_ex_sora_02_26,and
m_ex_sora_02_27,out! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_28,Hehe!
m_ex_sora_02_29,Perfect! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_30,"Yes,"
m_ex_sora_02_31,"just like you said,"
m_ex_sora_02_32,what I was actually asking about was
m_ex_sora_02_33,the weather up on the surface. ★
m_ex_sora_02_34,And you answered correctly! Congratulations! ♥
m_ex_sora_02_35,I feel oddly proud of myself.
m_ex_sora_02_36,As you should! ★
m_ex_sora_02_37,"You saw through my trick, hehe. ★"
m_ex_sora_02_38,But how do you know what the weather's like on the surface?
m_ex_sora_02_39,"Oh,"
m_ex_sora_02_40,"I have my ways, hehe. ★"
m_ex_sora_02_41,"I have a lot of connections, don't you know?"
m_ex_sora_02_42,Anyway!
m_ex_sora_02_43,I'll have to come and deliver your amazing prize in person!
m_ex_sora_02_44,Aw…
m_ex_sora_02_45,"I kind of expected this,"
m_ex_sora_02_46,but hearing you actually say it does put a damper on the excitement. ★
m_ex_sora_02_47,?
m_ex_sora_02_48,You're right. ★
m_ex_sora_02_49,"It is raining outside right now,"
m_ex_sora_02_50,just like you said.
m_ex_sora_02_51,"But in fact,"
m_ex_sora_02_52,I was really asking about
m_ex_sora_02_53,the weather up on the surface! ★
m_ex_sora_02_54,Oh… you were?
m_ex_sora_02_55,Yep! ★
m_ex_sora_02_56,"You didn't see that coming, did you?"
m_ex_sora_02_57,"No, I didn't."
m_ex_sora_02_58,Haha.
m_ex_sora_02_59,Keep that in mind the next time I give you a pop quiz. ♥
m_ex_sora_02_60,"Now then, I'll have to come over and give you your punishment in person."
m_ex_sora_02_61,You wait there. ♥
m_ex_sora_02_62,I'll be right over. ♥
m_ex_sora_03_1,"Hey Captain, whatcha doing?"
m_ex_sora_03_2,Thinking about me? ♥
m_ex_sora_03_3,"Yes, I'm thinking about you, Sora."
m_ex_sora_03_4,"No, I'm cleaning my room."
m_ex_sora_03_5,Hehe! That makes me so happy! ♥
m_ex_sora_03_6,What else were you doing besides that?
m_ex_sora_03_7,Cleaning my room.
m_ex_sora_03_8,All by yourself?
m_ex_sora_03_9,I figured other Nikkes would be helping you. ★
m_ex_sora_03_10,"They do sometimes, but I usually do it on my own."
m_ex_sora_03_11,Wow.
m_ex_sora_03_12,Very impressive. ♥
m_ex_sora_03_13,Could you share some tips with me?
m_ex_sora_03_14,Cielo and Sky are always saying
m_ex_sora_03_15,"how bad I am at organizing,"
m_ex_sora_03_16,but I don't get it. ★
m_ex_sora_03_17,"Although it's true that once I buy something, I never want to throw it away!"
m_ex_sora_03_18,It's such a waste to get rid of something that you spent so much time and effort purchasing. ♥
m_ex_sora_03_19,"So, I usually tuck them away somewhere, or put them into a pile. ★"
m_ex_sora_03_20,"Every time Sky and Cielo come over,"
m_ex_sora_03_21,they nag at me.
m_ex_sora_03_22,"They say I should throw away this junk, as they call it, and tidy up. ★"
m_ex_sora_03_23,"But if you ask me, none of it's junk!"
m_ex_sora_03_24,"It feels to me like everything is perfectly well organized, too. ★"
m_ex_sora_03_25,"When I want something,"
m_ex_sora_03_26,I know where to find it.
m_ex_sora_03_27,Isn't that the definition of organization?
m_ex_sora_03_28,"How do you organize things, Captain?"
m_ex_sora_03_29,"I use the same approach. As long as I know where it is, and I can reach it, it's good enough for me."
m_ex_sora_03_30,Oh man. ★
m_ex_sora_03_31,I should save this
m_ex_sora_03_32,and show it to Sky and Cielo later! ♥
m_ex_sora_03_33,"Still, it might not be a bad idea to throw out a few things that you don't use."
m_ex_sora_03_34,Oh! ★
m_ex_sora_03_35,But what if I end up needing it later?
m_ex_sora_03_36,That actually happened before!
m_ex_sora_03_37,Sky threw out an empty delivery box
m_ex_sora_03_38,"that she had deemed useless,"
m_ex_sora_03_39,"but the very next day,"
m_ex_sora_03_40,something that had been listed forever as secondhand was finally sold!
m_ex_sora_03_41,"At that moment, we could have really used that box."
m_ex_sora_03_42,"After that, I've been extra careful not to throw things out. ★"
m_ex_sora_03_43,… I see.
m_ex_sora_03_44,"Hahaha, Captain, you should be careful not to throw things out carelessly as well."
m_ex_sora_03_45,"Oh right, weren't you cleaning your room?"
m_ex_sora_03_46,I hope I didn't distract you. ♥
m_ex_sora_03_47,Go ahead and finish up so you can rest. ★
m_ex_sora_03_48,I'll be in touch. ♥
m_ex_sora_03_49,Looks like I've failed to convince Sora to throw some things out.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_1,Junior Blockhead.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_2,What are you doing?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_3,Thinking about you.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_4,Thinking about the next mission.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_5,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_6,Cut the crap and answer me properly.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_7,I'm just chilling.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_8,"Tsk, must be nice to have it that easy."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_9,"Yes, that's it."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_10,Make sure you never lose sight of that mindset.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_11,Is something wrong?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_12,?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_13,You're asking if something's wrong?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_14,Why would you even ask that?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_15,I only asked because you messaged me out of nowhere.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_16,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_17,What's that supposed to mean?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_18,That I shouldn't reach out without warning?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_19,"No, you usually only get in touch when there's a reason."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_20,Of course not. You can contact me anytime.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_21,That's true.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_22,Contacting you without a good reason would be a poor use of time.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_23,Don't count on it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_24,I barely have time to spare as is.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_25,"Anyway, there's something I want to ask."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_26,What do you think of Absolute now that we've been upgraded?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_27,I think your teamwork could use some improvement.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_28,I think you've become more perfect than before.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_29,Do you really think that?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_30,... No.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_31,"I know there's something you want to say, so quit playing games."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_32,Out with it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_33,I think your teamwork could use some improvement.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_34,I see.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_35,"In what way, exactly?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_36,Be specific.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_37,You want me to explain it now over text?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_38,Is it too much to type out?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_39,"Yeah, I guess so. It's kinda inconvenient."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_40,"Fine, wait a moment."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_41,I'll come to you.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_42,Where should I go?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_01_43,I tell Eunhwa my location.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_1,Hey.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_2,I have something to ask you.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_3,What is it?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_4,Do you like perfume too?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_5,"Yeah, I do."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_6,"Hmm, not really."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_7,Why?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_8,No particular reason. I just like it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_9,"Tch, how boring."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_10,Just as I suspected.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_11,Isn't the point of perfume to mask unpleasant smells?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_12,But Nikkes don't have any body odor.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_13,So there's no real need for it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_14,"Despite that, why..."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_15,does Emma obsess over fragrances so much?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_16,"Hmm, isn't it nice when something smells good?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_17,Sigh...
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_18,"The idea of a ""pleasant smell"" is vague from the start."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_19,"It might be pleasant to Emma,"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_20,but it's definitely not to me.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_21,Have you tried telling Emma that?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_22,Of course I have.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_23,"And as soon as I told her,"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_24,"she said, ""Oh, I see."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_25,"I guess I'll have to get a different scent ready then!"""
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_26,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_27,"Right now, there are already over 20 bottles of perfume"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_28,piled up in my room.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_29,"Even if I keep them sealed in the box, the smell still seeps out."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_30,This is a problem I just can't solve on my own anymore.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_31,So you fix it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_32,??
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_33,Can't you read? I said you fix it.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_34,Me? How?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_35,Figure something out somehow.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_36,"You're good at sweet-talking Nikkes with that silver tongue of yours,"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_37,so put that skill to good use
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_38,on Emma too.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_39,She's going to be here in 30 mins with another scent.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_40,That means you need to be here in 10 minutes.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_41,Come straight to my room.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_42,"Hurry up, I'll be waiting."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_43,Wait a sec... Eunhwa?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_44,There's no reply from Eunhwa...
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_02_45,Looks like I'll have to go check it out myself.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_1,You need to put a stop to Vesti and Emma.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_2,Where's this coming from?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_3,"I went along with that dumb pajama party,"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_4,and now they're talking about some beauty thing?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_5,What beauty thing?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_6,First we're supposed to apply makeup on each other.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_7,Then we recommend outfits we think look good.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_8,"So not only do we have to get made up, but we have to wear whichever outfit gets chosen."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_9,Can you imagine anything more horrible?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_10,"I dunno, sounds kinda fun to me."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_11,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_12,What did you say?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_13,You actually think this is fun? =.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_14,"Actually, that's great."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_15,You can join instead of me.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_16,I'm sure those two would love that.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_17,"Nah, they'd probably be disappointed if you back out."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_18,They'll manage.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_19,"Honestly, I don't get why we have to do these pointless events every single day off."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_20,They say
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_21,"it's for team-building,"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_22,but how exactly is this supposed to help with anything?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_23,Real bonding happens
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_24,through constructive talks
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_25,and planning strategies that actually aid our missions.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_26,Sounds a bit dry.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_27,??
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_28,"That all you've got to say, Junior Blockhead?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_29,"You know majority rules, right?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_30,Obviously.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_31,"Well, Emma and Vesti have the majority vote, so you've got to play along."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_32,Sigh...
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_33,I'm starting to regret bringing this up.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_34,"So, when's that supposed to happen?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_35,"What do you mean ""that""?"
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_36,That beauty thing.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_37,Our next day off.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_38,Why do you ask?
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_39,Because I want to watch too.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_40,=.=
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_41,Cut the crap.
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_42,"If you come, I'll kill you."
m_ex_eunhwa_tactical_03_43,"After that, Eunhwa doesn't reply anymore."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_2,I've got something to ask you!
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_3,"Which do you like better,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_4,mild scents or refreshing ones?
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_5,Mild scents.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_6,Refreshing scents.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_7,"Oh, really?"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_8,So that's what you like?
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_9,Thanks for telling me! I'll keep it in mind! ^__^
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_10,Why do you ask?
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_11,Oh!
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_12,"I've recently started mixing my own perfumes,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_13,"and it's way more fun than I expected, hehe."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_14,"Sometimes they turn out exactly how I imagined,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_15,"and other times,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_16,I get these totally surprising scents that I never thought possible.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_17,I've been having so much fun mixing
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_18,that I ended up with way too many perfumes!
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_19,"So I've been asking around about people's favorite scents,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_20,"and if I have something that matches, I give it as a gift."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_21,"I wanted to give you one too, so that's why I asked."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_22,"You don't dislike perfumes, do you?"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_23,"I'm okay with it, as long as it's not too strong."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_24,"Okay, I'll make a note of that too!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_25,"I gave one to Eunhwa and Vesti as well,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_26,and they really seemed to like it. ^__^
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_27,Eunhwa liked it?
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_28,"Hehe, yeah!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_29,"She even wears it regularly, believe it or not."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_30,"... I remember Eunhwa going around spritzing it everywhere, saying she had to use it up ASAP."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_31,She kept the remaining perfume carefully in a box.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_32,"... I also recall Eunhwa sighing, saying it was a real pain to deal with."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_33,... I see.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_34,"Of course, she always makes a sour face when I give her one,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_35,but Eunhwa never openly admits she likes anything.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_36,That's part of her charm! Hehe.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_37,"Anyway, since she seems to really like it,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_38,"I'm planning to give her and Vesti another bottle today,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_39,and I wanted to bring one for you too.
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_40,Would it be okay if I stopped by sometime today?
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_41,"Yeah, that's fine."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_42,"Okay, hehe! I'll come by later then."
m_ex_emma_tactical_01_43,I should probably warn Eunhwa that Emma is bringing her some more perfume again.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_2,I wanna talk to you about something.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_3,Hmm? What's up?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_4,You know how Absolute
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_5,"has gotten closer lately, right?"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_6,Eunhwa and Vesti
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_7,have been getting along really well these days! ^__^
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_8,"It's really great to see,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_9,but I think they're pushing themselves a little too hard.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_10,So I'm not sure what I should do about it. T.T
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_11,Pushing themselves?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_12,"I used to be the one in charge of cooking,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_13,and the other two handled stuff
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_14,like cleaning and tidying up.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_15,"But lately,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_16,they've been saying they want to take turns cooking.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_17,They said they feel bad for making me do it all the time.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_18,"It's really sweet of them,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_19,"but now that they've actually started helping out,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_20,they both seem really exhausted. >.<
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_21,"As you know, Commander,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_22,I love cooking!
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_23,"It's fine for me to do it every day,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_24,but it's a different story for Eunhwa and Vesti.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_25,They're always stressing over
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_26,what to make and how to make it.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_27,"I tried saying I'd take over the cooking duty,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_28,but they're completely against it! >.<
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_29,It's so hard watching them struggle like that… What do you think I should do?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_30,How about helping them secretly?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_31,How about helping out with the cleanup or something?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_32,"Oh my,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_33,"I was thinking the same thing too, hehe!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_34,Great minds really do think alike.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_35,"I've already been helping out with the cleanup,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_36,but I think the problem lies with the cooking. T_T
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_37,What if I help them secretly?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_38,"Then I'd feel at ease, and it'd help the both of them too."
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_39,"Two birds, one stone, right? ^__^"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_40,... It looks like Emma's asking a question she already knows the answer to.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_41,"Yeah, I think it's fine to do whatever you want."
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_42,You really think so?
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_43,"I feel so much better knowing that you agree, hehe!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_44,I'll give it a try starting today.
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_45,"Thanks for hearing me out, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_02_46,... I think it'd be best to contact Eunhwa and Vesti separately about this.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_2,"if you're free, would you like to go shopping with me?"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_3,Is there something you want to buy in particular?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_4,"Yes, I need to buy some new clothes."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_5,I'm looking for something to wear when I hang out with Vesti and Eunhwa on our next day off.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_6,"I thought it'd be nice if you helped me pick something out, hehe."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_7,Didn't you say you bought something not long ago?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_8,Oh my!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_9,You remembered!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_10,"That's right, Commander. T_T"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_11,I did buy something that I really liked.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_12,"Before I did that, I thought the size might be a bit tight,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_13,but I liked it so much that I just went ahead and got it.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_14,"But sure enough... T_T When I tried it on,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_15,it ripped right away! orz
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_16,"So I sent it for alterations,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_17,but it looks like that'll take some time.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_18,"My next day off is for two days,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_19,so I need to get a new outfit.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_20,Do your clothes often get ripped?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_21,"Fairly often, I'm afraid."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_22,The worst part is that it's always the same spot that ends up ripping :(
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_23,Where exactly?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_24,That must be upsetting.
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_25,"Oh my,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_26,it's a bit embarrassing to say... >.<
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_27,"Just use your imagination, Commander! ;)"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_28,It really is! T_T
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_29,"No matter how careful I am,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_30,it always happens...
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_31,"That's why I'd love for you to help me out this time, Commander!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_32,"Tell me if the clothes I pick fit me okay,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_33,and if they look good on me too!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_34,If it's a sizing issue...
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_35,How about getting some custom clothes made?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_36,Why not get them altered before you wear them?
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_37,Oh my goodness!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_38,That's a wonderful idea!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_39,"If I bring them the design I want,"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_40,"they can make it just like that, right?"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_41,"How exciting, hehe!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_42,"Oh, but..."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_43,Oh my goodness!
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_44,"That's a really great idea, but..."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_45,I think I'm a little short on time to make it happen right now. T_T
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_46,"Still, I'll definitely try it next time!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_47,"Thanks for the wonderful suggestion, Commander! :D"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_48,"For today, I'll just have to trust your fashion sense, hehe."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_49,"Okay, leave it to me."
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_50,"Oh my, how reassuring!"
m_ex_emma_tactical_03_51,"All right, let's meet in front of the Shopping Mall in an hour!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_1,Commander.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_2,Um...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_3,There's something I've been
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_4,wanting to ask you...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_5,Are you busy right now?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_6,"No, I'm free. Ask away."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_7,"Wow, thank goodness!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_8,It's kind of an embarrassing question...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_9,>///<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_10,"But I was just so, so curious"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_11,that I can't hold it in any longer!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_12,What is it?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_13,"Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_14,how do I look
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_15,after my tactical upgrade?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_16,What do you mean?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_17,What I mean is...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_18,Um...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_19,Do I look stronger? Cooler? Or something like that?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_20,I'm kinda curious what you think.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_21,You looked so strong that it even scared me.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_22,You looked so cool that I felt like I might fall for you.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_23,Oh...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_24,You're scared of me? T_T
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_25,Do you think I'm like a monster or something?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_26,"No, that's not it. I was just saying you look strong."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_27,"Oh, I see."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_28,That's a relief. >.<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_29,Really?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_30,>////<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_31,Do I really look that cool?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_32,That's fantastic!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_33,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_34,I'll do my best
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_35,to get even better feedback from you!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_36,"So... please keep watching over me from now on, okay?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_37,Of course. Keep it up.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_38,"Hehe, it's really nice to have you cheering me on, Commander."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_39,Thanks!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_40,I'll do my best!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_01_41,"The same goes for you, Commander!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_1,"Hehe, Commander!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_2,I've got something I wanna brag about!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_3,Yeah? What is it?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_4,"So, Emma, Eunhwa, and I"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_5,"have finally become super close friends,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_6,"and we had a pajama party, hehe!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_7,A pajama party?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_8,"Yeah, that's right!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_9,"It's a party where close friends put on their PJs,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_10,"snack on tasty treats and drinks,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_11,and gossip all night long about all sorts of things.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_12,"After we did that,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_13,"my heart got all warm and fuzzy, you know?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_14,>///<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_15,"It was so nice, hehe."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_16,"I have to say, I'm a little upset."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_17,Huh?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_18,Eh?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_19,"What's wrong, Commander?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_20,Why would you be upset?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_21,You and I haven't had a pajama party yet.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_22,Ah!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_23,"Now that I think about it, you're right!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_24,"I haven't done that with you yet, Commander!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_25,Maybe I wasn't that close of a friend to you after all.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_26,No!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_27,That's not it!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_28,Not at all!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_29,Um...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_30,Uh...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_31,The idea of having a pajama party
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_32,and hanging out with you in pajamas
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_33,makes me feel kind of self-conscious... T_T
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_34,"Uh, ahh! >///<"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_35,"But still, if we're really close friends, I guess it's okay, right?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_36,"Could you give me just a moment, Commander?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_37,I'll get ready right away!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_38,?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_39,Let's do it!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_40,Let's have a pajama party!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_41,Just give me a few minutes.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_42,I'll buy you a set of PJs and bring them over right away.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_43,"No, Vesti, wait!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_44,"I was just joking,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_45,really!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_46,But there's no reply from Vesti.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_02_47,"... Seems like she'll be here soon, so I'll wait for her."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_1,"Commander,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_2,do you like feminine girls? >.<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_3,"Yeah, I guess so."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_4,"No, not really."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_5,I knew it! >.<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_6,!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_7,"Oh, you don't?"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_8,"Hehe, that's a relief."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_9,What makes you ask?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_10,"Oh, well, um..."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_11,"I was talking with Eunhwa today,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_12,and we got on the topic of what kind of girls you might like.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_13,Eunhwa was sure that
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_14,you prefer the feminine and graceful type.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_15,"I told her I didn't think so,"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_16,but she kept insisting that that's exactly your type.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_17,"I wanted to check for myself, so I decided to ask you."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_18,"If you do like feminine girls, then well... I don't stand a chance :'("
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_19,Why do you think that?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_20,Huh?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_21,Since I'm far from the feminine type.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_22,"Come on, Vesti, you're feminine enough."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_23,Wha?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_24,Really?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_25,>///<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_26,What part of me makes you say that?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_27,Your clothing style.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_28,Yeah? And what else?
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_29,You also write in your diary every day.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_30,"Oh yeah, that's right!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_31,"Plus, you have this cute little hobby of decorating your diary, too."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_32,"Yeah, that's right! Hehe."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_33,"Wow, now that you mention it..."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_34,Thinking about how you've described me...
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_35,I guess I do have that side after all.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_36,"It's kinda surprising, to be honest."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_37,I never really thought that part of me
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_38,could come across as feminine!
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_39,"Hehe, somehow that actually makes me feel really happy."
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_40,I should write this down in my diary too.
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_41,>///<
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_42,"Thanks, Commander!"
m_ex_vesti_tactical_03_43,I'll be in touch!
m_ex_absolut_06_1,Commander!
m_ex_absolut_06_2,Commander!
m_ex_absolut_06_3,"Hey, Junior Blockhead."
m_ex_absolut_06_4,Yes?
m_ex_absolut_06_5,"You like cafes, don't you?"
m_ex_absolut_06_6,"No, that's not it, right?"
m_ex_absolut_06_7,"You like the Maid Cafe better, don't you, Commander?"
m_ex_absolut_06_8,Silence.
m_ex_absolut_06_9,"Now, just tell me the Armory's the best."
m_ex_absolut_06_10,Why?
m_ex_absolut_06_11,Don't ask why.
m_ex_absolut_06_12,Just answer like that.
m_ex_absolut_06_13,"Hey, Eunhwa, that's so unfair!"
m_ex_absolut_06_14,How can you do that? T_T
m_ex_absolut_06_15,"Hehe, this might be sudden, but can I ask you something?"
m_ex_absolut_06_16,"Commander, where do you like to go the most?"
m_ex_absolut_06_17,Cafes.
m_ex_absolut_06_18,The Maid Cafe.
m_ex_absolut_06_19,The Armory.
m_ex_absolut_06_20,"Oh my, hehe. I knew you'd say that."
m_ex_absolut_06_21,"That's so you, Commander! ^^"
m_ex_absolut_06_22,=.=
m_ex_absolut_06_23,:S
m_ex_absolut_06_24,Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
m_ex_absolut_06_25,"Well, actually..."
m_ex_absolut_06_26,"We were talking about what would be fun to do during the next break,"
m_ex_absolut_06_27,but everyone wanted to go different places and do different things.
m_ex_absolut_06_28,"So we decided to ask you,"
m_ex_absolut_06_29,"and we'll go wherever you say you like best, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_06_30,"I see. Well, a cafe is a safe, solid choice, isn't it?"
m_ex_absolut_06_31,"Yeah, but..."
m_ex_absolut_06_32,Emma said she'd be making the desserts herself at the cafe... T_T
m_ex_absolut_06_33,And the drinks too :/
m_ex_absolut_06_34,"It's been a while, but I finally got a chance to cook for everyone again!"
m_ex_absolut_06_35,"I can't tell you how happy that makes me, hehe! ^^"
m_ex_absolut_06_36,"If you're free, Commander, would you like to come too?"
m_ex_absolut_06_37,"Sorry, but I'm busy."
m_ex_absolut_06_38,Come.
m_ex_absolut_06_39,"You started this, so take responsibility and eat it all before you leave."
m_ex_absolut_06_40,Yeah!
m_ex_absolut_06_41,"I think you should definitely come too, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_06_42,"Hehe, so you'll be coming too, Commander?"
m_ex_absolut_06_43,I'll let you know the exact time once we've decided.
m_ex_absolut_06_44,"No, I said I'm busy..."
m_ex_absolut_06_45,Yay!
m_ex_absolut_06_46,"Hehe, I'm so happy!"
m_ex_absolut_06_47,"I knew it! I just knew you'd say the Maid Cafe, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_06_48,Tsk. =.=
m_ex_absolut_06_49,"Aww, that's too bad, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_06_50,Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
m_ex_absolut_06_51,"Uh, well..."
m_ex_absolut_06_52,"We were talking about where to go for our upcoming break,"
m_ex_absolut_06_53,but everyone wanted to go somewhere different.
m_ex_absolut_06_54,"So,"
m_ex_absolut_06_55,"to be fair, we decided we'd go wherever you chose, Commander!"
m_ex_absolut_06_56,And you just so happened to pick the place I wanted to go!
m_ex_absolut_06_57,>///<
m_ex_absolut_06_58,Why the hell do we have to go somewhere like that on our day off?
m_ex_absolut_06_59,I just don't get it at all.
m_ex_absolut_06_60,It's a ton of fun there! Really!
m_ex_absolut_06_61,"The maids wear these super cute outfits,"
m_ex_absolut_06_62,"and they make all these pretty, delicious desserts just for you!"
m_ex_absolut_06_63,"Ooooh, that sounds like fun!"
m_ex_absolut_06_64,Right?
m_ex_absolut_06_65,"Anyway! We agreed to go wherever the Commander chose,"
m_ex_absolut_06_66,"so no changing your minds now, okay?"
m_ex_absolut_06_67,"You're utterly useless,"
m_ex_absolut_06_68,Junior Blockhead. =.=
m_ex_absolut_06_69,"Eunhwa, hehe, you're not thinking of running away, are you?"
m_ex_absolut_06_70,Eunhwa doesn't respond.
m_ex_absolut_06_71,:S
m_ex_absolut_06_72,She won't even answer my calls. T_T
m_ex_absolut_06_73,"Oh dear, I'd better go look for her right away!"
m_ex_absolut_06_74,"Thank you, Commander! See you around!"
m_ex_absolut_06_75,Wait... did you really contact me just for that?
m_ex_absolut_06_76,"For once,"
m_ex_absolut_06_77,you actually gave a decent answer.
m_ex_absolut_06_78,You've grown. Well done.
m_ex_absolut_06_79,"Aww, that's too bad, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_06_80,=.=
m_ex_absolut_06_81,Can I ask my question now?
m_ex_absolut_06_82,Go ahead.
m_ex_absolut_06_83,Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
m_ex_absolut_06_84,"We were discussing where to go for our day off,"
m_ex_absolut_06_85,but Emma and Vesti came up with some really pointless places.
m_ex_absolut_06_86,:/
m_ex_absolut_06_87,It's not pointless at all!
m_ex_absolut_06_88,"So I figured we'd ask you,"
m_ex_absolut_06_89,then go wherever you said.
m_ex_absolut_06_90,"You're not seriously going to spend your day off at the Armory, are you?"
m_ex_absolut_06_91,"Yes, we are."
m_ex_absolut_06_92,"Weapon maintenance must never be neglected, even during downtime."
m_ex_absolut_06_93,"Moreover, when it comes to building camaraderie,"
m_ex_absolut_06_94,drafting strategies that can help with operations
m_ex_absolut_06_95,is very helpful.
m_ex_absolut_06_96,You call that a day off?!
m_ex_absolut_06_97,That just sounds like more work to me. T_T
m_ex_absolut_06_98,"I also think that it's really important to take proper breaks, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_06_99,This too counts as rest.
m_ex_absolut_06_100,"No, it doesn't! :("
m_ex_absolut_06_101,What's with all the bellyaching?
m_ex_absolut_06_102,Didn't we agree to go with Junior Blockhead's answer?
m_ex_absolut_06_103,"You cheated, Eunhwa."
m_ex_absolut_06_104,"So of course it's kinda hard for us to just accept it, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_06_105,What?
m_ex_absolut_06_106,"Yeah, that's right!"
m_ex_absolut_06_107,You told the Commander to say the Armory's the best!
m_ex_absolut_06_108,That's cheating! So it doesn't count!
m_ex_absolut_06_109,"Trying to weasel your way out already, huh?"
m_ex_absolut_06_110,"Regardless of the method, a win's a win."
m_ex_absolut_06_111,"And this time, I won."
m_ex_absolut_06_112,"We gotta talk this out in person, Eunhwa!"
m_ex_absolut_06_113,I'm heading over as well. ^^
m_ex_absolut_06_114,Hey... guys?
m_ex_absolut_06_115,Can you calm down for a sec and listen to me?
m_ex_absolut_06_116,"Honestly, I actually like the Maid Cafe better."
m_ex_absolut_06_117,"However, no one answers."
m_ex_absolut_07_1,Commander!
m_ex_absolut_07_2,"I've got something I wanna ask you, hehe."
m_ex_absolut_07_3,"Yeah, what's up?"
m_ex_absolut_07_4,"You're not seriously going to ask him, are you?"
m_ex_absolut_07_5,Of course! ^^
m_ex_absolut_07_6,"Asking him directly is definitely the surest way, after all."
m_ex_absolut_07_7,"Yeah, but..."
m_ex_absolut_07_8,It's just so embarrassing. T_T
m_ex_absolut_07_9,What's this all about?
m_ex_absolut_07_10,It's nothing serious!
m_ex_absolut_07_11,I just got curious about your ideal type.
m_ex_absolut_07_12,So can you tell us what type of person you like? Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_07_13,Hmm...
m_ex_absolut_07_14,"Wait, stop!"
m_ex_absolut_07_15,?
m_ex_absolut_07_16,"Don't answer, Commander! T_T"
m_ex_absolut_07_17,Didn't you say you were curious?
m_ex_absolut_07_18,I certainly am.
m_ex_absolut_07_19,"Ah, well..."
m_ex_absolut_07_20,"I am kinda curious too, but... T_T"
m_ex_absolut_07_21,Phew...
m_ex_absolut_07_22,"Okay. I'm ready now, Commander."
m_ex_absolut_07_23,Go ahead and tell me.
m_ex_absolut_07_24,The type of girls I like is...
m_ex_absolut_07_25,No! Wait!
m_ex_absolut_07_26,I can't! I'm not ready! T_T
m_ex_absolut_07_27,Tsk. =.=
m_ex_absolut_07_28,What is the matter with you?
m_ex_absolut_07_29,Are you curious or not? Make up your mind.
m_ex_absolut_07_30,"What about you, Eunhwa?"
m_ex_absolut_07_31,Do you really have to ask such an obvious question?
m_ex_absolut_07_32,"No, I'm not interested."
m_ex_absolut_07_33,What the hell do I care what Junior Blockhead is into?
m_ex_absolut_07_34,Oh?
m_ex_absolut_07_35,Weren't you pretty fired up
m_ex_absolut_07_36,when we were chatting just now? Hehe.
m_ex_absolut_07_37,What? When have I ever... =.=
m_ex_absolut_07_38,That never happened.
m_ex_absolut_07_39,Someone was even saying things like he probably likes feminine girls.
m_ex_absolut_07_40,Shut up. =.= That's enough.
m_ex_absolut_07_41,"So, are you going to tell us or not?"
m_ex_absolut_07_42,Oh boy...
m_ex_absolut_07_43,"Okay, I think I'm ready to hear it now."
m_ex_absolut_07_44,Uh... wait! T_T Maybe not yet!
m_ex_absolut_07_45,"... At this rate, the conversation is just going to keep going in circles."
m_ex_absolut_07_46,Uh... I think I have to head out on a mission.
m_ex_absolut_07_47,"Sorry, but let's talk again later."
m_ex_absolut_07_48,"Oh my, Commander..."
m_ex_absolut_07_49,You dodged that one pretty well.
m_ex_absolut_07_50,"So he ran off, huh?"
m_ex_absolut_07_51,Ugh... T_T
m_ex_absolut_07_52,"Next time, I'll definitely work up the courage to ask! T_T"
m_ex_absolut_07_53,"Hehe, I'm curious too, so I'll just have to ask you later."
m_ex_absolut_07_54,"See you soon, Commander!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_1,Pal.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_2,Um...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_3,I've got something to ask.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_4,Uh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_5,What do you think?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_6,Of what?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_7,I see that you changed your profile picture.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_8,"Ah, um..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_9,"Well, you see..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_10,"Something's changed, right?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_11,I can't really tell.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_12,"Oh, you changed your profile picture."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_13,What?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_14,Ugh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_15,"Seriously,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_16,"you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_17,"Haha, you changed your profile pic."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_18,"Yeah, that's it."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_19,What do you think?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_20,Is it too much?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_21,It's cute. I like it.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_22,Cu...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_23,Cute?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_24,Do you really mean that?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_25,Yeah.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_26,Uh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_27,Uhhh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_28,Are you making fun of me right now?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_29,"No, I'm not."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_30,Really?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_31,"Yeah, I mean it."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_32,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_33,Well...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_34,"If you really think so,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_35,maybe changing it wasn't such a bad idea after all.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_36,"Honestly, I was super torn about"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_37,whether to change it or not.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_38,I guess you have moments like this too.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_39,Huh?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_40,"What do you mean ""moments""?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_41,I thought you wouldn't worry about things like that.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_42,"Pal,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_43,what do you take me for?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_44,"For your info, I'm a girl too!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_45,I can worry about stuff like this just as well as anyone!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_46,Sorry.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_47,Whatever.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_48,"I'm disappointed in you, Pal."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_49,... Milk seems to be sulking.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_01_50,I'd better go cheer her up quickly.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_1,"Pal, I'm curious about something."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_2,Got a sec?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_3,"Yeah, go ahead."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_4,"Uh, so..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_5,What if a girl who's usually all laid-back
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_6,suddenly showed up in front of you with full makeup on
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_7,and dressed all girly?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_8,What would you think then?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_9,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_10,"Don't get the wrong idea! I'm just asking,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_11,so don't go reading into it!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_12,I'd probably love it.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_13,It might surprise me how different she looks.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_14,Really?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_15,Why?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_16,"She did it for me, after all."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_17,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_18,"Doing something I'm not used to is kinda weird, right?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_19,I might feel a little flustered too.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_20,"No, I just meant it would be nice."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_21,"Oh,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_22,I see...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_23,"So you'd like it, huh?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_24,Yes.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_25,Phew...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_26,Glad to hear that.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_27,I feel a bit better now.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_28,"I like you just as you are, Milk. You don't have to worry so much about it."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_29,Ugh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_30,"Geez, Pal..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_31,Don't do that!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_32,Why?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_33,Are you seriously asking because you don't know?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_34,Or are you just pretending not to?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_35,?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_36,Uggggggghhhhhh!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_37,I'm so embarrassed I could die!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_38,Why would someone who knows better do this?!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_39,Sorry.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_40,"Ah,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_41,apologizing like that
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_42,makes me go soft!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_43,"Fine, whatever."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_44,"Next time we meet,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_45,we'll settle it over a cup of coffee.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_46,Got it?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_02_47,"Sure, sounds good."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_1,Pal.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_2,you've seen Ade
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_3,"fight, right?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_4,"Yeah, she's incredible."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_5,"I know, right?!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_6,"Okay, so I wasn't seeing things."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_7,"I thought she was just some mild-mannered maid,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_8,"and wow, was I shocked."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_9,Why are you bringing up Ade anyway?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_10,"After seeing her like that,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_11,how could I just stay calm?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_12,It's been ages since I've felt something surging up inside me.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_13,You want to take her on?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_14,"Yeah, that's right."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_15,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_16,But her agreeing to any sudden challenge of mine
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_17,"doesn't really seem like her style, so I'm not sure what to do."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_18,Want me to ask her for you?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_19,"Oh,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_20,you'd really do that?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_21,Sure. I'll even be the referee.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_22,"Ohh, that would be great!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_23,Haha.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_24,"Starting today, it's special training time!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_25,Pack your stuff and meet me at the gym.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_26,"You'll join me, won't you, Pal?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_27,Is it really okay? We haven't even asked Ade yet.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_28,It doesn't matter if the challenge doesn't happen.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_29,I just can't stay still with this feeling bubbling inside me.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_30,That's a great mindset.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_31,"Kek, you betcha!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_32,That's what sports are all about!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_33,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_34,What do I have to bring...?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_35,"Gloves, bandages, shin guards..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_36,"That should be enough, right?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_37,Bring the bunny girl outfit too.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_38,?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_39,Wha... Why the bunny girl outfit?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_40,You want me to train in that?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_41,"The thinner the outfit, the higher the defense. Everyone knows that."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_42,Ade is at her strongest in a bunny girl outfit.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_43,"Pal, what are you even saying?"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_44,That kind of thing only applies to other universes!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_45,That has nothing to do with it at all!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_46,"As long as the outfit doesn't get in the way,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_47,anything should be fine!
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_48,"Sigh... Pal,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_49,Are you sure this isn't just because you want to see me in a bunny girl outfit?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_50,"No, that's not it!"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_51,"Pal, don't lie."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_52,Put your hand on your chest and tell me again.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_53,Is that really not the reason?
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_54,"Honestly, it's been a while, so I've been wanting to see you in a bunny girl outfit..."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_55,Sigh...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_56,I knew it.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_57,Hmm...
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_58,"Well, I guess it can't be helped."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_59,"If you want it that much,"
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_60,I might just have to think about it.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_61,"You're the best, Milk."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_62,Don't get your hopes up.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_63,I've not decided yet.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_64,"Haha, got it."
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_65,Then tell Ade to wear it too.
m_ex_milk_bloomingbunny_03_66,I'll totally die of embarrassment if I'm the only one who wears it.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_1,"Master,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_2,may I have a moment of your time?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_3,There is something I wish to discuss with you concerning our future plans.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_4,"Sure, what's the matter?"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_5,"Well,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_6,"as I will now be serving as a secret agent,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_7,I believe there will be occasions when I must contact you.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_8,"Rather than establishing a new means of communication,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_9,I would like to continue using this one.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_10,Would that be all right with you?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_11,That's fine.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_12,I see.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_13,That's a relief. :)
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_14,"Henceforth,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_15,I shall continue to use this
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_16,"to contact you, Master."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_17,Okay.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_18,Hehe.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_19,Thank you kindly. :)
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_20,But Ade...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_21,"Yes, Master?"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_22,Is something the matter?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_23,Did you change your profile picture?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_24,"Oh, that?"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_25,"Well,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_26,I merely thought that setting a new profile picture
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_27,"would make it easier for you, Master, to recognize that I am currently on a mission."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_28,I had no other intention.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_29,It is solely to prevent any misunderstandings from others.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_30,"Hehe, it's fine."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_31,I like it.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_32,Ah...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_33,... Ade doesn't reply for a while.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_34,I apologize.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_35,"I was momentarily at a loss for words,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_36,and thus my reply was delayed.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_37,"I am relieved to hear that it pleases you, Master."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_38,"Henceforth,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_39,"whenever I am on a mission, I shall use this profile picture."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_40,"I would be grateful if upon seeing it,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_41,"you could interpret the context of my messages accordingly, Master."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_01_42,"Sure thing, haha."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_1,"While taking on a mission,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_2,a thought struck me:
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_3,"If I had not become a maid,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_4,what work might I have taken up?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_5,"I mulled over it for some time,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_6,yet the answer eluded me…
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_7,I can't really imagine you as anything but a maid.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_8,"So, Master, you feel the same."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_9,Hmm...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_10,"Were I to pursue another profession,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_11,what kind of role do you believe would suit me best?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_12,A cool special agent.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_13,A seductive bunny girl.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_14,I see.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_15,"In the course of carrying out this mission,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_16,I found myself taking an interest in the work of a secret agent.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_17,"At times, I even deemed it rather enjoyable."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_18,And yet...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_19,Oh...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_20,I suppose...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_21,I rather doubt that a bunny girl...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_22,would be fitting for me...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_23,It looks really good on you.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_24,I see...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_25,Even so...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_26,I feel that any appearance other than that of a maid
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_27,would feel unnatural to me.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_28,"Even during missions, no matter what disguise I take,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_29,I always strive to uphold my duties as a maid
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_30,"by doing my utmost to serve you, Master."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_31,I believe it is precisely because I hold to that principle that I'm able to take on other appearances at all.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_32,"After all, it's all in pursuit of becoming the perfect maid."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_33,As expected of a perfect maid!
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_34,Thank you kindly. :)
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_35,So does that mean I'll get to see you in all sorts of costumes from now on?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_36,"Pardon me, Master,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_37,but I'm not sure I fully understand.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_38,"You said that being a maid lets you take on all kinds of appearances, right?"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_39,"Yes, that is so."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_40,All kinds of appearances... right?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_41,Oh!
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_42,I'm looking forward to what kind of outfit comes after the bunny secret agent.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_43,"Oh, no..."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_44,That's not what I meant!
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_45,I didn't mean I'll be wearing all sorts of costumes from now on...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_46,"Of course, a maid outfit is technically a costume too,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_47,but that's not the point.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_48,What I was trying to say is...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_49,"Um, Master?"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_50,"You're still reading this, aren't you? T_T"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_02_51,"I want to tease Ade a little more, so I'll just leave things as they are."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_1,There truly are all sorts of people
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_2,at Coin Rush.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_3,"The customers who visit this place, in particular,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_4,have an atmosphere
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_5,quite different from those who visit Maid For You.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_6,How are they different?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_7,I would say that
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_8,"while both come in pursuit of enjoyment,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_9,the kind of enjoyment they seek is quite different.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_10,Perhaps that is why the manner in which the staff here
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_11,receive their guests feels distinctly different from our own.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_12,"Yeah, bunny girl outfits and maid uniforms have completely different vibes."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_13,"Oh, no."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_14,"I wasn't referring to the outfits,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_15,but rather to the manner in which we serve others.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_16,"Naturally,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_17,"the attire is of importance as well, but"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_18,"Haha, relax."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_19,Sorry T_T
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_20,So what do you think the difference between the two is?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_21,We seek to satisfy our patrons
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_22,"through composed, personalized service tailored to their wishes."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_23,"Here at Coin Rush, however,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_24,it feels as though the staff present dazzling performances and services
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_25,to delight the guests
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_26,even before they have fully formed a desire in their minds.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_27,I think I get what you mean.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_28,"Yes,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_29,watching them has taught me many things.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_30,I realize that there are various ways
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_31,to serve and bring satisfaction to others.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_32,"If I have the opportunity,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_33,I would like to learn their methods as well.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_34,So does that mean I'll get to see you working at Coin Rush in a bunny girl outfit?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_35,"Um, well..."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_36,"Even if I were to master the methods,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_37,working at Coin Rush as part of Maid For You might be a bit problematic.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_38,"Not that it's strictly impossible,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_39,but maybe it could work if I did house-call maid services instead.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_40,"Though in that case,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_41,I don't think I could wear a bunny girl outfit T_T
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_42,"Just kidding, haha."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_43,I suppose...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_44,"If that is your wish, Master,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_45,"once I have learned their methods,"
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_46,I shall invite you to experience my new services.
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_47,"Until then, I ask for your patience."
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_48,Will you be in a bunny girl outfit?
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_49,Yes...
m_ex_ade_agentbunny_03_50,Then I'll be looking forward to it.
